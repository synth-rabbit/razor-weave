    <section id="part-i-foundations" class="part-intro" aria-labelledby="part-i-heading">
      <h1 id="part-i-heading">Part I: Foundations</h1>
      <p>
        Part I introduces the core ideas of the game: what it is about, how to read and use this rulebook, and
        how to build characters who feel grounded in the world. These chapters define Attributes, Actions,
        Checks, Tags, Conditions, Clocks, and the overall flow of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of Part I, you should understand how to create a character, how to resolve uncertainty at the
        table, how combat, exploration, and social scenes work, and how to collaborate with your group and GM to
        tell stories together.
      </p>
    </section>
    <header id="ch-01-welcome-to-the-game">
      <h1 id="welcome-to-the-game">1. Welcome to the Game</h1>
      <p>
        This Core Rulebook is the single source of truth for the system. It explains how to create characters,
        how to resolve uncertain moments, and how to build stories together across many different genres. You do
        not need to memorize the entire book before you play. You only need to know where to look when questions
        arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules are written with a fiction first mindset. The story comes first. Mechanics support the story
        when the outcome of an action is uncertain and meaningful. When the outcome is clear, you simply describe
        what happens and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This game is built for cooperative play. The table is a creative team. Players bring characters to life.
        The <a href="#gm" class="glossary-link"><strong id="gm-definition">Game Master</strong></a> presents the world, its challenges, and its opportunities. The rules help everyone answer
        a single question together: what happens next?
      </p>
      <p>
        The chapters that follow will introduce the core concepts, show you how to use this book, and guide you
        through creating your first character. Later sections deepen the rules and provide tools for long running
        campaigns, solo journeys, and shared authority play.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section id="ch-02-core-concepts">
      <h2 id="core-concepts-at-a-glance-heading">2. Core Concepts at a Glance</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter introduces the most important ideas in the system in a compact form. Later chapters expand
        and refine them, but everything begins here. You can return to these concepts whenever you need to realign
        on how the game is meant to feel at the table.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-fiction-first">Fiction First</h3>
      <p>
        The story is always the starting point. You begin by understanding the situation, describing what the
        characters do, and only then reaching for rules if the outcome is uncertain and meaningful. You do not
        start with a rule and then try to force the fiction to match it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-characters">Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Characters are the main lens through which you experience the world. They are defined by four Attributes
        (Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Presence (PRE), Reason (RSN)), a small set of Skills, a focused group of Proficiencies, and the
        choices they make. Characters also have histories, goals, and unresolved threads that tie them to the
        world.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-checks-outcomes">Checks and Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        A Check is the system's way of resolving uncertainty when the stakes matter. When you make a Check, you
        use an Attribute, a Skill, and the shared fiction to determine what is at risk. The result produces an
        outcome tier, which becomes the next beat in the story. Success, partial success, and failure are all
        ways for the story to move forward.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-tags-conditions-clocks">Tags, Conditions, and Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions are short descriptors that shape how the world and characters behave. Tags are applied
        to scenes, locations, or situations. Conditions are ongoing states on characters. Clocks are visual
        trackers of danger, opportunity, or change. Together they help the table feel the weight of time and
        consequence.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-table-collaboration">Table Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        The system assumes that everyone at the table contributes to the story. The GM presents the world
        honestly. Players act through their characters with clear intent and approach. The rules help resolve
        what happens when those actions encounter uncertainty or resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can begin play after reading Chapters 1 through 6. The rest of the book deepens and extends the core
        ideas as your table needs them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-03-how-to-use-this-rulebook">
      <h2 id="how-to-use-this-rulebook-heading">3. How to Use This Rulebook</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter explains how to navigate the Core Rulebook, how to understand the structure of the system,
        and how to use the text at the table. You do not need to memorize everything before you begin play. The
        book is designed so that you can learn the basics, then return to specific chapters as questions arise.
      </p>

      <h3 id="navigating-the-book">Navigating the Book</h3>

      <p>
        The Core Rulebook is organized to support both reading and quick reference. The structure is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chapters 1 through 5</strong> introduce the game, the core concepts, how to use the book, the principles of play, and the different ways to play.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 6 through 13</strong> present the core rules that players will use most often at the table, including character creation, attributes, and core resolution.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 14 through 17</strong> provide the full Skills and Proficiencies references.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 18 through 20</strong> collect key mechanical references such as Tags, Conditions, and advancement.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 21 through 26</strong> give the Game Master tools for running scenes, campaigns, and alternative modes of play.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 28 and 29</strong> provide the glossary and index.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are new to tabletop roleplaying, it is helpful to read Chapters 1 through 5 in order. If you
        already have experience, you can skim the early chapters, then focus on Chapters 6 and 7, where the
        core resolution and character structure are introduced in detail.
      </p>

      <h3 id="rules-as-tools">Rules as Tools</h3>

      <p>
        The rules in this book are tools. They help the table answer the question of what happens next. You do
        not exist to serve the rules. The rules exist to support your story. When a rule clarifies a moment, use
        it. When a rule does not add anything useful, resolve the situation through conversation instead. The
        game is at its best when the rules and the fiction work together.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system is built around a single resolution structure. Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks all connect to this structure. Once you understand how Checks work, the rest of
        the mechanics will feel familiar and consistent.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The group reaches a sealed laboratory door. The GM describes the control panel and the faint glow
        of backup power. The players discuss how their characters might open it. No one grabs dice yet. The
        table first decides whether the action is risky and meaningful. Only then do the rules become
        necessary.
      </div>

      <h3 id="what-a-rule-explains">What a Rule Explains</h3>

      <p>
        Every major rule in this book answers three questions. What does this rule cover. When does it
        apply. How does it influence the fiction. These three ideas appear in the way chapters are written
        and in the examples that follow them. If a rule feels confusing, return to these questions. They
        usually point to the intended use.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fiction-first-structure">Fiction First Structure</h3>

      <p>
        The rules always follow the fiction. You begin by understanding the situation, the environment, and
        the characters. You describe what is happening in the story. Only when the outcome of an action is
        uncertain and meaningful do you reach for mechanics. You do not start with a rule and then try to
        force the fiction to match it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="checks-in-context">Checks in Context</h3>

      <p>
        Checks are the system's way of resolving uncertainty. Later chapters explain the procedure in
        detail. This chapter focuses on how to think about Checks as you read. A Check is a signal that the
        scene has reached a point where chance and consequence matter. When a Check is called for, the
        chapter you are reading will explain exactly which part of the system is in focus.
      </p>

      <h3 id="learning-the-flow">Learning the Flow of the System</h3>

      <p>
        The system has a flow that you will learn over time. You do not need to master everything at once.
        Instead, you can approach the book in layers. First, read enough to understand the core loop. Then,
        as your group encounters new situations, you can read or reread the chapters that support those
        scenes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="intent-and-approach-in-the-text">Intent and Approach in the Text</h3>

      <p>
        As you read rule examples, notice how often the words intent and approach appear. They are used
        deliberately. Intent describes what the character wants to achieve. Approach describes how the
        character is trying to achieve it. Many examples in this book use that pairing to show why certain
        Attributes, Skills, or Proficiencies apply.
      </p>

      <h3 id="recognizing-rule-triggers">Recognizing Rule Triggers</h3>

      <p>
        Not every scene needs mechanical resolution. One of the skills you develop as you read and play is
        the ability to recognize which moments call for specific rules. When the story reaches a point where
        uncertainty and consequence align, a rule triggers. A chapter might say that a certain kind of
        situation often triggers a Check, or that a specific type of danger often advances a Clock.
      </p>

      <h3 id="using-examples">Using Examples</h3>

      <p>
        Examples appear throughout this book to demonstrate the rules in action. They follow a consistent
        pattern. The scene is described. A player states intent and approach. The GM decides whether a Check
        is needed. Dice are rolled. The outcome changes the situation. The example then shows how that
        change affects the next moment of the story.
      </p>

      <h3 id="using-the-glossary">Using the Glossary</h3>

      <p>
        The glossary at the end of the book is the authoritative source for terms. When a word has a
        glossary definition, it will appear with a link the first time it is used in a chapter. If you are
        uncertain about the meaning of a term, check the glossary entry. It often clears up confusion that
        might arise from casual reading.
      </p>

      <section id="keyboard-shortcuts" class="keyboard-shortcuts">
        <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
        <p>
          When reading the web version of this rulebook, you can use keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation
          to major sections. These shortcuts help you jump directly to the content you need without scrolling
          through the entire document.

      </section>

      <h3 id="reading-as-a-group">Reading as a Group</h3>

      <p>
        Many groups benefit from reading the early chapters together. A session zero that includes a shared
        read through of the welcome, core concepts, and principles of play chapters helps everyone align on
        tone and expectations. Chapter 5, Ways to Play the Game, is also useful to read as a group so that
        everyone understands which play style you are aiming for.
      </p>

      <h3 id="chapter-3-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>

      <p>
        This chapter has given you a lens for reading the rest of the book. Treat the rules as tools that
        support your story. Let the fiction guide when mechanics come into play. Use examples and the
        glossary to deepen your understanding. Move at a pace that feels comfortable. The next chapter
        introduces the core principles of play that shape every session at your table.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-04-core-principles-of-play">
      <h2 id="core-principles-of-play-heading">4. Core Principles of Play</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter explains the principles that shape every session of the game. These principles guide how
        players describe actions, how the GM presents situations, and how the table works together to move the
        story forward. They are not rules in the mechanical sense. They are values and habits that help the
        system produce consistent and engaging play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game uses a fiction first approach. You begin with the situation, decide what the characters do,
        and let the rules support the story when uncertainty and consequence appear. The principles below help
        the table maintain that flow.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-table-creative-team">The Table Is a Creative Team</h3>
      <p>
        Every player at the table is part of the creative process. The GM presents the world. Players bring
        characters to life. The conversation between them becomes the engine of play. No one person controls
        the story. The table builds it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM describes locations, events, and pressures. Players respond by stating what their characters
        attempt. When the situation contains meaningful risk, the rules support the moment. In scenes that are
        calm or certain, the group continues the story through simple narration.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The GM describes a run down depot on the outskirts of a coastal town. A player says their character
        wants to scout the area quietly. Another player suggests checking the rail lines for signs of use. The
        GM listens, considers what is true about this place, and describes what those actions reveal. No rule
        is required yet. The table is building the fiction through conversation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-intent">Player Intent Drives Action</h3>
      <p>
        A player states what their character wants to accomplish. This is intent. They then explain how their
        character attempts it. This is approach. The GM uses intent and approach to decide whether the action
        succeeds automatically or whether risk is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intent focuses the scene. Approach shapes which Attributes, Skills, or Proficiencies may apply. The
        rules always interpret a character's attempt in the context of the fiction, not as a puzzle of
        modifiers.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-gm-honesty">The GM Presents the World Honestly</h3>
      <p>
        The GM is responsible for portraying the world clearly and fairly. This means describing situations
        honestly, sharing sensory details, and revealing information that the characters would reasonably
        perceive. The GM does not use surprises to punish the players. Instead, surprises serve the fiction and
        come from established threats or incomplete information.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Insight</strong>
        Honesty does not mean revealing every detail. It means playing the world as it is, not as a tool to
        control the players. Present danger when danger exists. Present opportunity when opportunity exists.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-fiction-first-mechanics-second">Fiction First, Mechanics Second</h3>
      <p>
        Mechanics never replace the shared imagination of the table. Instead, they provide structure when the
        story reaches a point of risk or uncertainty. If no risk exists, the GM simply narrates the outcome of
        the player's action. This keeps the pace smooth and avoids unnecessary rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain, the stakes matter to the story, and
        failure or partial success would move the scene forward in an interesting way.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-failure-momentum">Failure Creates Momentum</h3>
      <p>
        Failure is not an end point. It is a change in direction. When a Check fails, the story moves forward
        into a new state. This might introduce complications, new dangers, or shifts in position. Failure
        should never stop the story. It should bend it.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A character tries to leap across a narrow canal. The Check fails. The GM does not say the character
        falls into the water and nothing more happens. Instead, the GM describes how the character grabs a
        rusted ladder, swings against the wall, and attracts the attention of guards nearby. The failure adds
        motion to the scene.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-partial-success">Partial Success Is a Core Story Beat</h3>
      <p>
        Partial success provides a result that sits between success and failure. The character achieves part of
        what they intended, but not all of it, or they succeed with a cost. This outcome creates tension,
        opportunity, and interesting decisions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-gm-describes-outcomes">The GM Describes Outcomes, Not Numbers</h3>
      <p>
        The players roll dice. The GM interprets the results in the fiction. A number never appears without
        narrative meaning. The GM describes what the dice reveal. The story changes in ways that make sense in
        the scene.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-agency">Player Agency Comes From Clear Choices</h3>
      <p>
        Agency in this system comes from informed decision making. The GM describes situations in enough detail
        that players can understand what is at stake and choose their actions freely. When the stakes are clear,
        Checks feel meaningful and satisfying.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-world-responds">The World Responds to Character Action</h3>
      <p>
        Every action changes the situation. When the players act, the GM updates the fiction. Threats advance.
        Opportunities emerge. Characters alter their position, their resources, or their standing with others.
        The world is not static. It reacts.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A character tries to convince a merchant to delay a shipment. The Check is a partial success. The
        merchant agrees to a delay, but only if the character promises to return a personal favor. The world
        changes. The favor becomes a new thread in the story.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-ownership">Respect for Player Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        Players own their characters. They express their thoughts, motivations, and actions. The GM does not
        decide how a character feels or what a character chooses. The GM presents the world. Players choose how
        their characters engage with it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-scenes-direction">Scenes Have Direction</h3>
      <p>
        A good scene moves toward something. Sometimes this is an objective. Sometimes it is a revelation.
        Sometimes it is a moment of tension or a decision. The GM frames scenes with purpose. Players act with
        intent. Checks provide turning points.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-trust">Trust at the Table</h3>
      <p>
        Trust supports everything. The GM trusts players to act with the fiction in mind. Players trust the GM
        to run the world honestly. The table trusts the system to provide structure when necessary. This trust
        allows everyone to play boldly.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The principles in this chapter describe how the table works together. The GM presents the world
        honestly. Players express intent and approach. The fiction leads. Mechanics support. Failure creates
        momentum. Partial success adds tension. The world responds. Scenes have direction. Trust holds
        everything in place. The next chapter expands on these principles by showing how different modes of play
        shape the experience of the system.

    <section id="ch-05-ways-to-play">
      <h2 id="ways-to-play-the-game-heading">5. Ways to Play the Game</h2>

      <p>
        This game supports multiple styles of play. Some groups meet weekly around a table. Others play online
        in short sessions. Some prefer a single player experience. Others use a shared world without a
        designated Game Master. The system is flexible and does not assume one standard format. The rules in
        later chapters work for all modes of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chapter gives an overview of each play style. It also points to the sections of the book that
        support them. You do not need to choose one style forever. Many groups switch between modes depending on
        who is available or what kind of story they want to tell.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-group-play-gm">Group Play With a GM</h3>
      <p>
        A group gathers with one person acting as Game Master. The GM presents the world, plays its <a href="#npc" class="glossary-link"><strong id="npc-definition">characters</strong></a>,
        and describes the consequences of player actions. The <a href="#pc" class="glossary-link"><strong id="pc-definition">players control their own characters</strong></a> and make
        decisions that drive the story forward.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-duet-play">Duet Play</h3>
      <p>
        Duet play involves one player and one GM. It feels more intimate and often focuses on personal stories
        or character driven arcs. Scenes can shift quickly. The pacing is flexible.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-gmless-cooperative">GMless Cooperative Play</h3>
      <p>
        In GMless play, the group shares narrative responsibility. No single person controls the world. Instead,
        the table uses procedures that rotate authority and help distribute scene framing, consequences, and
        world building. The game still uses the core resolution system, but each player takes turns providing
        challenges or interpreting outcomes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-solo-play">Solo Play</h3>
      <p>
        Solo play is designed for a single player. The player controls one or more characters and uses
        structured tools to emulate the world. These tools include prompts, oracles, and scene framing
        procedures. Solo play keeps the core mechanics intact.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-asynchronous">Asynchronous and Play by Post</h3>
      <p>
        Asynchronous play occurs through messages, email, shared documents, or online platforms. Players take
        turns responding when they have time. Because asynchronous play lacks immediate conversation, clarity
        is essential. Players describe intent and approach carefully. The GM presents outcomes with enough
        detail to move the story forward between posts.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-one-shot-sessions">One Shot Sessions</h3>
      <p>
        A one shot is a complete adventure played in a single session. These sessions help introduce new
        players to the system and work well for conventions or special events. One shots focus on clear stakes
        and strong pacing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-campaign-play">Campaign Play</h3>
      <p>
        A campaign is a longer story told over multiple sessions. Campaigns grow through character development,
        evolving threats, and unfolding consequences. The GM builds on player actions and uses tools like
        Clocks and Tags to maintain continuity.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-hybrid-styles">Hybrid Styles</h3>
      <p>
        Many tables blend modes. Some groups use solo play between sessions to develop character arcs. Others
        rotate GMless scenes inside a GM led campaign. Some begin with a one shot and transition into a long
        form campaign. The system supports these transitions without additional rules.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-choosing-mode">Choosing the Right Mode</h3>
      <p>
        There is no single correct way to play. Each mode offers a different experience. Choose group play for
        shared storytelling and dynamic character interaction. Choose duet play for intimate stories. Choose
        GMless for collaborative world building. Choose solo play for personal exploration. Choose asynchronous
        play for flexible schedules. Choose one shots for quick adventures. Choose campaigns for deep, evolving
        narratives.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This chapter described the supported modes of play. The system works whether you have one player or six,
        whether you have a GM or distribute authority, and whether you play in person or through messages. The
        next chapter introduces the character framework that supports all of these play styles.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-06-character-creation">
      <h2 id="character-creation-heading">6. Character Creation</h2>

      <p>
        Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a
        concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that
        reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule
        before you start. This chapter guides you step by step and tells you when to reference later chapters
        for details.
      </p>

      <h3 id="character-creation-learning-by-example">Learning by Example</h3>
      <p>
        Some players prefer to see a full character before reading detailed steps. If you want to follow a
        character build from start to finish, you can skip ahead to the example character later in this chapter
        and return to each step as needed.
      </p>

      <h3 id="character-creation-flow">The Creation Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Character Creation follows a clear sequence. You begin with story driven questions, then add mechanical
        structure, then return to fiction to finalize your concept. Each step builds on the previous one.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Step One: Choose a Concept</li>
        <li>Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements</li>
        <li>Step Three: Assign Attributes</li>
        <li>Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies</li>
        <li>Step Four: Choose Skills</li>
        <li>Step Five: Choose Proficiencies</li>
        <li>Step Six: Determine Starting Gear</li>
        <li>Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships</li>
        <li>Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads</li>
        <li>Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="step-one-choose-a-concept">Step One: Choose a Concept</h3>
      <p>
        Every character begins with a concept. A concept is the short answer to the question, who is this
        person. It is the foundation for every choice you make later in the process. The concept does not depend
        on mechanics. It does not require a long backstory. It is a clean expression of identity, role, and
        theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for
        discovery. A concept like retired scout with a guilty conscience offers a clearer direction than simply
        fighter. The first concept suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world. The
        second is mostly a job title.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A player chooses the concept former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message
        patterns. This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours,
        delicate tools, and unanswered questions.
      </div>

      <p>
        Your concept should tell you what kind of scenes you want to be in, what skills you might have learned,
        and what challenges might matter to you. If you feel stuck, talk with the GM and the other players. The
        group can help you find a concept that fits the tone of the campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-two-core-identity-elements">Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Identity elements are the personal details that give your character depth. They are the details that
        help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at
        once. The goal is to add enough information that the character feels real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Useful identity elements include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name and pronouns</li>
        <li>Origin or home environment</li>
        <li>Everyday role or profession before the story begins</li>
        <li>Notable habits and mannerisms</li>
        <li>First impressions and social style</li>
        <li>One or two key experiences that shaped them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These details are most helpful when they connect to your concept. If your concept involves quiet work
        and technical skill, identity elements that reflect that focus will make the character feel grounded.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement
        built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes
        are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.
      </div>

      <p>
        You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character.
        For now, capture the parts that feel most important.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-three-assign-attributes">Step Three: Assign Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character tends to
        approach challenges when there is no time to prepare a careful strategy. Attributes are not personality
        traits. They are expressions of how your character acts when the moment demands action.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system uses four Attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#might" class="glossary-link"><strong id="might-definition">Might (MIG)</strong></a>: Physical strength, force, and raw endurance.</li>
        <li><a href="#agility" class="glossary-link"><strong id="agility-definition">Agility (AGI)</strong></a>: Balance, coordination, stealth, and quick reaction.</li>
        <li><a href="#presence" class="glossary-link"><strong id="presence-definition">Presence (PRE)</strong></a>: Social force, confidence, emotional expression, and leadership.</li>
        <li><a href="#reason" class="glossary-link"><strong id="reason-definition">Reason (RSN)</strong></a>: Logic, analysis, memory, and structured thinking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        New characters begin with the following Attribute spread.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One Attribute at 2</li>
        <li>Two Attributes at 1</li>
        <li>One Attribute at 0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability. Characters
        begin competent but not exceptional in every area. As the campaign progresses, advancement rules will
        allow Attributes to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assign these values based on your concept and identity elements. Ask yourself which Attribute your
        character relies on most often, which areas they find challenging, and which weaknesses might create
        interesting story moments.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella is analytical and steady. Her player chooses Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0. This
        emphasizes her careful thinking, modest coordination, quiet presence, and relative physical weakness.
      </div>

      <h3 id="before-skills-proficiencies">Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        This system does not rely on a fixed or exhaustive list of Skills or Proficiencies. The rulebook
        provides examples and frameworks, but players are encouraged to work with their GM to define custom
        entries that reflect their character's experiences, training, and background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills and Proficiencies serve different purposes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Skills</strong> are action based competencies. They are used directly in Checks when your character attempts something under pressure or uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Proficiencies</strong> are narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines that your character understands well and that shape how the GM interprets the fiction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Open lists and collaboration allow the system to support many different genres and character concepts
        without requiring constant balance adjustments. Because the resolution system and advantage rules keep
        extremes in check, creative choices stay within a stable range.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM has final approval over the scope of any custom Skill or Proficiency. A good entry is grounded in
        the setting, clear in purpose, and neither so broad that it covers everything nor so narrow that it
        rarely matters.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-four-choose-skills">Step Four: Choose Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Skills represent learned abilities and practiced competencies. They describe what your character has
        done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. Skills connect directly to action. When your
        character makes a Check, a Skill often shapes their approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills answer the question, what have you practiced enough to apply under stress. They cover actions
        such as moving quietly, reading a room, patching an injury, climbing, or analyzing a pattern. Skills are
        usually written as verbs or verb like phrases.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, choose a small set of Skills that reflect your concept and background. These
        are the actions your character knows how to perform with some confidence. Later chapters describe
        Skills in more detail and provide example lists grouped by Attribute.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses
        the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions
        she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels.
      </div>

      <p>
        You do not need to optimize your Skills. The best choices are the ones that support the kinds of scenes
        you want to experience. If your group plans to focus on investigation, travel, or social tension, choose
        Skills that will shine in those situations.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-five-choose-proficiencies">Step Five: Choose Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Proficiencies represent narrower areas of expertise that influence how the GM interprets the fiction.
        They describe tools, technologies, environments, or disciplines that your character understands deeply.
        Proficiencies often do not require a roll at all. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is
        obvious, or how serious a risk feels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proficiencies answer the question, what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly. They
        often appear as nouns or domain labels, such as medical tools, survey equipment, or small boat
        navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, choose a small number of Proficiencies that grow naturally out of your
        concept and background. Work with the GM to make sure each Proficiency has a clear scope and fits the
        setting.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the
        Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands
        the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.
      </div>

      <p>
        Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they influence difficulty, consequences, and
        access to information. A character with the correct Proficiency may identify a hazard more quickly,
        avoid an unnecessary roll, or reduce the severity of a complication.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-six-starting-gear">Step Six: Determine Starting Gear</h3>
      <p>
        Your character begins play with a small set of equipment that fits their background, reflects their
        concept, and supports the type of stories they are about to enter. Gear does not provide numerical
        bonuses. It provides narrative capability, fictional positioning, and a sense of grounded reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting gear should feel personal and practical. It represents what your character already knows how
        to use. It also helps the GM understand what kind of situations your character is prepared for.
      </p>

      <h4>Basic Gear Package</h4>
      <p>New characters begin with the following items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clothing suited to their environment</li>
        <li>A backpack or satchel</li>
        <li>Basic travel supplies</li>
        <li>A personal item that holds meaning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are the essentials that allow any character to operate in the world.
      </p>

      <h4>Concept Driven Gear</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to the basic gear, each character chooses up to three items that reflect their background or
        profession. These items help define who they were before the story begins. They also give the GM material
        to work with when shaping scenes.
      </p>
      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A well used toolkit</li>
        <li>A compact field journal</li>
        <li>A collection of reference notes</li>
        <li>A handmade navigation compass</li>
        <li>A signal mirror</li>
        <li>A small medical pouch</li>
        <li>A set of precision tools</li>
        <li>A reliable lantern</li>
        <li>A simple musical instrument</li>
        <li>A deck of analysis cards</li>
        <li>A set of rope and climbing spikes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These items should feel directly connected to your concept and identity.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher
        fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work.
      </div>

      <h4>Tools and Equipment as Fictional Authority</h4>
      <p>
        Gear provides fictional authority. If your character carries the right tools for a task, the GM may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower difficulty</li>
        <li>Remove uncertainty</li>
        <li>Change the stakes</li>
        <li>Provide clearer approaches</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Gear does not guarantee success. It enables meaningful choices and supports your character’s expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the character does not have suitable gear, the GM might increase difficulty or introduce
        complications. Gear matters most when the environment or situation is demanding.
      </p>

      <h4>Weapons and Dangerous Tools</h4>
      <p>
        If the campaign tone allows for weapons or hazardous tools, characters may begin with one simple item
        that fits their concept. This might be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A pocket knife</li>
        <li>A small baton</li>
        <li>A bow with a few arrows</li>
        <li>A sturdy multi tool</li>
        <li>A simple sidearm, if the genre supports it</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Weapons should be grounded in the fiction of your setting. They are not meant to be superior mechanical
        objects. They are narrative tools that help shape how your character approaches risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your world does not include weapons or includes them only sparingly, this section may be reduced or
        removed based on GM preference.
      </p>

      <h4>Custom Gear</h4>
      <p>
        The player and GM may collaborate to create custom gear that supports the concept. The item should be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear in purpose</li>
        <li>Grounded in the setting</li>
        <li>Useful in scenes</li>
        <li>Not mechanically overwhelming</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Good custom gear is memorable and unique without dominating the story.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-seven-background-relationships">Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        Every character comes from somewhere. They have lived a life before the story begins. They have
        connections, memories, challenges, and unfinished business. Establishing background and relationships
        gives the character emotional depth and provides the GM with narrative tools that will enrich scenes,
        challenges, and future arcs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Background should answer simple questions about where you grew up, what kind of work you used to do,
        which pressures shaped you, and who influenced your habits. You do not need a long timeline. Focus on
        the few details that explain your current self.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were
        spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. The steady routine and quiet
        tension of relay work shaped her temperament and made her comfortable with long stretches of focused
        attention.
      </div>

      <p>
        In addition to background, define one or two meaningful relationships. These might be mentors, rivals,
        family members, coworkers, or friends. The relationship does not need to be fully detailed. It only
        needs to be important enough that it might matter later.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing.
        Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods. The disagreement left tension
        that has never been resolved.
      </div>

      <p>
        You do not need to define every relationship up front. Leave space for new connections to emerge in
        play. When a new NPC feels important, you can add them to your relationship list.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-eight-goals-drives-threads">Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads</h3>
      <p>
        Goals and drives explain why your character keeps moving. They are the internal pressures that shape
        choices and responses. A goal is something concrete your character wants to achieve. A drive is a deeper
        motivation or fear that pushes them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal threads are unresolved elements in your character's life. They might be unanswered questions,
        unfulfilled promises, or lingering tensions. These threads give the GM material to weave into future
        scenes.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella has a goal to decode an anomalous pattern she once intercepted and a drive to avoid causing harm
        through her work. A personal thread involves the mysterious origin of the pattern and who might have
        sent it.
      </div>

      <p>
        Try to define at least one short-term goal, one long-term goal, and one or two personal threads. You can
        always revise these as the story unfolds.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-nine-final-review">Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have completed the previous steps, review your character as a whole. Ask whether the concept,
        identity elements, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, goals, and
        threads feel like parts of the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talk with the GM and other players about how your character fits into the campaign. Look for natural
        connections, shared history, or complementary goals. Adjust details where needed so that the group feels
        like a cohesive cast.
      </p>

      <h3 id="example-character-rella">Example Character Build: Rella</h3>
      <p>
        This section presents Rella as a complete example character, summarizing the choices made in each step.
        Use this example as a reference when creating your own characters.
      </p>

      <h3 id="character-creation-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the
        campaign. By moving from concept to identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background,
        relationships, and goals, you build a character who feels grounded and ready for play. Later chapters
        explain how these elements interact with the core mechanics during sessions.

    <section id="ch-07-characters-and-attributes">
      <h2 id="characters-and-attributes-heading">7. Characters and Attributes</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter deepens the character framework introduced in Character Creation. It explains how
        Attributes define what your character is naturally good at, how those ratings interact with intent and
        approach, and how to think about Attribute growth over time. Skills and Proficiencies add texture and
        specialization. Attributes provide the core pillars those details rest on.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attributes-overview">Attributes Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Every character has four Attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Might (MIG)</strong> – Physical power, endurance, and resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Agility (AGI)</strong> – Speed, precision, balance, and reflexes.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence (PRE)</strong> – Charisma, willpower, and social influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Reason (RSN)</strong> – Logic, perception, memory, and analytical thinking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Attribute ratings are small numbers that reflect how strongly each pillar shows up in play. During
        Character Creation, you assign a starting spread (usually 2, 1, 1, 0) across MIG, AGI, PRE, and RSN.
        Those ratings are then added to relevant checks throughout the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attributes are always interpreted through the fiction. A high MIG character does not simply “have +2.”
        They push through heavy doors, endure long marches, and soak physical hardship more easily. A high RSN
        character spots patterns, recalls obscure details, and notices when something does not fit.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attribute-ratings-and-meaning">Attribute Ratings and What They Mean</h3>
      <p>
        Attribute ratings are intentionally compact. Most characters begin with values between 0 and 2. This
        keeps the focus on intent, approach, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and the `4d6` dice
        results instead of on large numerical bonuses.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general guideline:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0</strong> – Unremarkable. You can attempt normal tasks with no special edge or penalty.</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> – Competent. You are noticeably capable in this area compared to an average person.</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> – Exceptional. You stand out in most situations that rely on this Attribute.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you make a Check, you roll <strong>4d6</strong>, sum the dice, and add your Attribute rating (and
        any other bonuses or penalties). You compare that total against a Difficulty Class (DC) from the
        standard ladder (typically DC 12–22). The difference between your total and the DC is the margin, which
        determines the outcome tier. A higher Attribute nudges those margins upward without guaranteeing any
        particular result.
      </p>

      <h3 id="choosing-your-starting-spread">Choosing Your Starting Spread</h3>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, you assign a small array of values across your four Attributes. The default
        array is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One Attribute at <strong>2</strong></li>
        <li>Two Attributes at <strong>1</strong></li>
        <li>One Attribute at <strong>0</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This spread creates characters who are competent across several areas with a clear primary strength and
        one relative weakness. You can think of this as your character’s natural “starting shape” before Skills,
        Proficiencies, Tags, and gear are layered on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A useful way to choose your spread is to ask three questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which Attribute describes how you most often solve problems when under pressure?</li>
        <li>Which Attribute fits your concept but should remain a supporting strength rather than your main focus?</li>
        <li>Which Attribute would be interesting to struggle with?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Answering these questions usually reveals where to place your 2, your two 1s, and your 0. You are not
        optimizing a build—you are deciding what kind of situations will feel natural, challenging, or risky for
        this character.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attributes-and-archetypes">Attributes and Archetypes</h3>
      <p>
        Different spreads suggest different kinds of characters. The table below offers a few example archetypes.
        You do not need to use these labels at the table—they are here to help you think about possibilities.
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>Example Attribute Spreads and Archetypes</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Spread</th>
            <th>Example Archetype</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>MIG 2, AGI 1, PRE 1, RSN 0</td>
            <td>Front-line problem solver</td>
            <td>Leads with physical action and presence; relies on others for deep analysis.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MIG 0, AGI 2, PRE 1, RSN 1</td>
            <td>Scout or infiltrator</td>
            <td>Excels at movement and precision; must negotiate around brute-force obstacles.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MIG 1, AGI 0, PRE 2, RSN 1</td>
            <td>Negotiator or leader</td>
            <td>Strong in social scenes; needs help when delicate physical work is required.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MIG 1, AGI 1, PRE 0, RSN 2</td>
            <td>Analyst or investigator</td>
            <td>Solves problems through observation and planning; may struggle to command a room.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Use these examples as prompts, not prescriptions. You can apply any spread to any concept. A physically
        powerful scholar or a socially adept scout can be just as compelling as the “expected” combinations.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attributes-intent-approach">Attributes, Intent, and Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes are chosen based on <em>how</em> your character attempts something, not on what they would
        like to roll. The GM listens to your intent (what you are trying to achieve) and your approach (how you
        attempt it), then chooses the Attribute that best matches that description.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same fictional goal can be resolved with different Attributes depending on approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prying open a stuck hatch with brute force might call for <strong>MIG</strong>.</li>
        <li>Picking the lock or working delicate mechanisms might call for <strong>AGI</strong>.</li>
        <li>Coaxing someone on the other side to open it might call for <strong>PRE</strong>.</li>
        <li>Analyzing the structure to find a weak point might call for <strong>RSN</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This flexibility keeps Attributes tied to the story. You do not choose an Attribute from a menu. You
        describe what your character does. The Attribute follows naturally from that description.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Calling for an Attribute</strong>
        When a player describes intent and approach, repeat back what you heard in your own words, then say
        which Attribute you think applies and why. If the table disagrees, adjust together. The goal is shared
        understanding, not surprise rulings. If two Attributes seem equally valid, choose the one that fits the
        character’s established habits, or offer the player a choice with different risks attached.
      </div>

      <h3 id="working-with-low-attributes">Working with Low Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        A rating of 0 is not a punishment. It means your character does not naturally lean on that Attribute
        when things get tense. The game expects you to have at least one area where you are merely ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Low Attributes shape the story in interesting ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A low MIG character might avoid direct contests of strength and instead look for tools, allies, or alternate routes.</li>
        <li>A low AGI character might favor careful planning over risky stunts.</li>
        <li>A low PRE character might rely on written communication, intermediaries, or quiet influence.</li>
        <li>A low RSN character might lean on intuition, experience, or other party members for analysis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Play your weaknesses honestly and creatively. They provide hooks for growth, tension, and teamwork.
        When a situation hinges on your low Attribute, it does not mean you should stay silent. It means the
        stakes are higher, and failure may reveal something important about who you are.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attribute-examples-by-attribute">Examples by Attribute</h3>

      <h4 id="attribute-mig">Might (MIG)</h4>
      <p>
        Might represents physical strength, raw effort, and bodily resilience. It appears whenever you forcefully
        move, lift, or endure something.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – MIG Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> A storm has washed out a small bridge. The group needs to move a heavy improvised
        plank into place before the river rises further.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> The GM calls for a MIG-based Check using <strong>4d6</strong> against DC 16 (Tough). The
        character with MIG 2 and the appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> On a full success, the plank is set and the group crosses safely. On a partial
        success, the plank holds but the character gains a Strained condition. On a failure, the plank slips,
        and the GM advances a flood Clock.
      </div>

      <h4 id="attribute-agi">Agility (AGI)</h4>
      <p>
        Agility covers balance, precision, and quick reactions. It appears when you dodge, climb, sneak, or
        operate fine mechanisms under pressure.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – AGI Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> A character sprints across slick rooftop tiles to reach a signal mast before an alarm
        spreads.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> The GM sets DC 18 (Hard) due to rain and height. The character with AGI 1 and a relevant
        Skill rolls `4d6+1`. A hazardous Tag on the roof may impose Burden if the group ignored earlier
        warnings.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> On a full success, they reach the mast in time. On a partial success, they make
        it but leave evidence behind or trigger a lesser alarm. On a failure, they slip, and the GM ticks a
        danger Clock or applies a Condition such as Exposed or Dazed.
      </div>

      <h4 id="attribute-pre">Presence (PRE)</h4>
      <p>
        Presence governs social force, confidence, and emotional weight. It appears when you persuade, command,
        intimidate, or rally others.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – PRE Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> The group needs a nervous official to delay a shipment. A character steps forward to
        make the case.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> The GM sets DC 14 (Routine) if the request is modest, or higher if the stakes are severe.
        The character with PRE 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`. Helpful Tags (Shared History) or
        Proficiencies (Bureaucratic Procedures) may grant Edge.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> On a full success, the delay is granted cleanly. On a partial success, the delay
        comes with a favor owed or a complication. On a failure, the official refuses and alerts a rival faction.
      </div>

      <h4 id="attribute-rsn">Reason (RSN)</h4>
      <p>
        Reason covers analysis, pattern recognition, and careful observation. It appears when you investigate,
        deduce, plan, or notice hidden details.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – RSN Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> A character studies overlapping telegraph logs to determine whether a recent outage is
        natural or engineered.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> The GM sets DC 16 (Tough). The character with RSN 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls
        `4d6+2`. A relevant Proficiency (Telegraph Instruments) may lower the DC or reveal extra context on a
        success.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> On a full success, they identify the outage as deliberate and tie it to a specific
        region. On a partial success, they confirm it was engineered but only narrow the possibilities. On a
        failure, they misinterpret the data and the GM advances a faction Clock based on that error.
      </div>

      <h3 id="multi-attribute-actions-and-teamwork">Multi-Attribute Actions and Teamwork</h3>
      <p>
        Many scenes involve multiple characters and overlapping actions. Instead of treating every moment as a
        separate Check, think about how Attributes combine across the group.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One character might use MIG to hold a door while another uses RSN to bypass its lock.</li>
        <li>A PRE-focused character might draw attention so an AGI-focused ally can move unseen.</li>
        <li>Two characters with different strengths might both roll, with the table focusing on the more
          interesting result.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The GM decides whether each character rolls separately, one character rolls with assistance, or a single
        roll represents the group’s combined effort. Whichever option you choose, keep intent and approach in
        view. Assistance should make sense in the fiction, not just on the character sheet.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attribute-growth-preview">Attribute Growth Preview</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes do not change every session. They grow slowly across a campaign as characters reach important
        milestones, resolve personal threads, and survive significant consequences. Advancement rules appear in
        the Advancement and Long Term Growth chapter later in this book.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Attributes do increase, the change should feel meaningful in the fiction. A rise in MIG might come
        after a season of hard labor or survival in harsh conditions. A rise in RSN might follow extended study,
        investigative breakthroughs, or hard lessons learned from mistakes. Treat Attribute growth as an
        opportunity to reflect on how the character has changed, not just as a numerical upgrade.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Signaling Growth</strong>
        When a player increases an Attribute, ask them to describe one moment from the campaign that symbolizes
        that change. Then add a Tag to the world, a new relationship, or an updated detail on the character’s
        sheet that reflects their growth. This keeps advancement grounded in the shared story rather than only
        in numbers.

      <h2 id="actions-checks-outcomes-heading">8. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter describes the core resolution engine of the game. Whenever a character takes an action and
        the outcome is uncertain, consequential, and within their reach to influence, the table may call for a
        Check. Checks turn intent and approach into dice, and dice back into story beats. Understanding how to
        call for, perform, and interpret Checks is essential for both players and the GM.
      </p>

      <h3 id="when-to-roll-and-when-not-to">When to Roll (and When Not To)</h3>
      <p>
        You roll when the GM calls for a Check. The GM should only do this when three conditions are all true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal
          conditions does not roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Consequence</strong>: Failure or partial success would introduce tension, cost, or change. If failure just means
          “try again until it works,” do not roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Agency</strong>: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Do not roll for things entirely outside
          the characters’ control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If all three are present, a Check is appropriate. If one or more are missing, the GM either says “yes”
        and narrates success, or “no” and explains why it is impossible or out of scope. Checks are tools for
        focusing on interesting uncertainty, not a gate in front of every action.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – When to Roll</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is
        significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous.<br />
        <em>Assessment:</em> The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character’s choices
        matter. The GM calls for a Check.<br />
        <em>Counter‑example:</em> The same character crossing a sturdy bridge in calm weather does not roll.
        Success is assumed; the story moves forward.
      </div>

      <h3 id="the-core-check-procedure">The Core Check Procedure</h3>
      <p>
        Every Check follows the same basic loop:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The player declares intent and approach.</li>
        <li>The GM decides whether a Check is needed.</li>
        <li>If needed, the GM selects an Attribute and relevant Skill, sets a DC, and notes any Tags,
          Conditions, or Proficiencies that might grant Edge or Burden.</li>
        <li>The player rolls <strong>4d6</strong>, applies modifiers, and compares the total to the DC.</li>
        <li>The table interprets the outcome tier (critical success, full success, partial success, failure,
          critical failure) and updates the fiction accordingly.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="declaring-intent-and-approach">Declaring Intent and Approach</h3>
      <p>
        When you declare an action, you state two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intent</strong>: What you want to achieve in the fiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Approach</strong>: How you are trying to achieve it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Intent focuses the scene. Approach determines which Attribute, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and
        Conditions are relevant. The more concrete and grounded your description, the easier it is for the GM to
        set an appropriate DC and for the group to picture the moment.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Intent and Approach</strong><br />
        <em>Intent:</em> “I want to get the factory foreman to delay shipment of the crates.”<br />
        <em>Approach:</em> “I speak with her in private, emphasize the safety risks, and show her evidence of the
        faulty wiring we found.”<br />
        The GM recognizes this as a PRE‑based approach with a relevant social Skill and possibly a Proficiency
        related to safety procedures or technical documentation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="setting-dcs">Setting DCs</h3>
      <p>
        The GM sets a <a href="#dc" class="glossary-link"><strong id="dc-definition">Difficulty Class (DC)</strong></a> to represent how hard the task is under current circumstances. The
        system uses a standard ladder:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DC 12</strong> – Easy</li>
        <li><strong>DC 14</strong> – Routine</li>
        <li><strong>DC 16</strong> – Tough</li>
        <li><strong>DC 18</strong> – Hard</li>
        <li><strong>DC 20</strong> – Heroic</li>
        <li><strong>DC 22</strong> – Legendary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Start by imagining what success would look like in the scene and how far it is from effortless. Use
        lower DCs when characters have strong fictional positioning, good information, and safe conditions. Use
        higher DCs when time is short, the environment is hostile, or the task is at the edge of what is
        possible in the setting.
      </p>

      <h3 id="advantage-disadvantage-tags-conditions">Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than constantly adjusting the DC, the game often represents favorable or unfavorable circumstances
        through <a href="#advantage" class="glossary-link"><strong>Edge</strong></a> and <a href="#disadvantage" class="glossary-link"><strong>Burden</strong></a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong id="advantage-definition">+1 Edge</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep the best 4.</li>
        <li><strong>+2 Edge</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep the best 4.</li>
        <li><strong id="disadvantage-definition">-1 Burden</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep the worst 4.</li>
        <li><strong>-2 Burden</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep the worst 4.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Edge and Burden usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies, or
        prior setup actions. They represent the table’s shared sense that the character is favored or hindered in
        this moment. Multiple sources combine into a single level of Edge or Burden and are capped at
        ±2—several small edges do not create infinite Edge, and multiple problems do not push you below −2.
        If a character would have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (for example,
        +2 and −1 becomes +1) until only one side remains, then apply the final level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions described in earlier chapters provide a shared vocabulary for these modifiers:
        <a href="#dim-light" class="glossary-link"><em>Dim Light</em></a>, <a href="#slick" class="glossary-link"><em>Slick</em></a>, or <em>Exposed</em> might impose Burden; <a href="#solid-cover" class="glossary-link"><em>Solid Cover</em></a>
        or <em>Marked</em> might grant Edge in specific contexts or to specific parties.
      </p>

      <h3 id="rolling-4d6-and-calculating-margin">Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin</h3>
      <p>
        When a Check is called for, follow this procedure:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Roll <strong>4d6</strong>, adjusting the number of dice kept if Edge or Burden applies.</li>
        <li>Add the relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects.</li>
        <li>Compare the total to the DC to find the <a href="#margin" class="glossary-link"><strong id="margin-definition">margin</strong></a> (Roll − DC).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The margin determines the outcome tier:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong id="critical-success-definition">Critical Success</strong>: Margin ≥ +5.</li>
        <li><strong id="full-success-definition">Full Success</strong>: Margin ≥ 0.</li>
        <li><strong id="partial-success-definition">Partial Success</strong>: Margin −1 to −2.</li>
        <li><strong id="failure-definition">Failure</strong>: Margin ≤ −3.</li>
        <li><strong id="critical-failure-definition">Critical Failure</strong>: Margin ≤ −7 or all 1s.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="interpreting-outcomes">Interpreting Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Every outcome tier should change the situation. The GM and players work together to describe what the
        dice mean in the fiction.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#critical-success" class="glossary-link"><strong>Critical Success</strong></a> – You achieve more than you aimed for. Extra benefits, stronger
          position, or accelerated progress.</li>
        <li><a href="#full-success" class="glossary-link"><strong>Full Success</strong></a> – You get what you wanted with no significant cost. The scene moves
          forward cleanly.</li>
        <li><a href="#partial-success" class="glossary-link"><strong>Partial Success</strong></a> – You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect.
          Momentum continues, tension rises.</li>
        <li><a href="#failure" class="glossary-link"><strong>Failure</strong></a> – You do not achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Threats
          advance, resources strain, or positions worsen.</li>
        <li><a href="#critical-failure" class="glossary-link"><strong>Critical Failure</strong></a> – Things go significantly wrong. Use sparingly for dramatic beats:
          broken tools, dangerous exposure, or major escalations.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Cross‑Genre Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> In a cozy town, a character tries to calm a panicked neighbor during a storm. In a
        sci‑fi station, a character tries to reassure a frightened technician during a systems failure.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> Both are PRE‑based Checks against DC 14 (Routine) with an appropriate social Skill. The
        cozy scene might grant Edge if the characters have a strong existing relationship.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> Full success calms the NPC and stabilizes the scene. Partial success calms them but
        attaches a new obligation or rumor. Failure escalates the panic, spreading fear or misinformation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="group-checks-and-assistance">Group Checks and Assistance</h3>
      <p>
        Many actions involve more than one character. Rather than rolling for everyone separately every time, the
        GM can use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assistance</strong>: One character leads the action, another assists. If the assistance is
          credible in the fiction, the leader gains Edge or a small bonus.</li>
        <li><strong>Representative Checks</strong>: One Check stands in for a coordinated group effort. The
          outcome tier describes how the whole group fares.</li>
        <li><strong>Split Risks</strong>: Two or more characters each roll, and the GM focuses on the most
          interesting combination of results rather than tracking every detail.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pick the method that best fits the moment. Use single rolls when you want quick resolution. Use
        individual rolls when it is important that different characters face different consequences.
      </p>

      <h3 id="checks-and-clocks">Checks and Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Some obstacles are too big for a single Check. Instead, the GM creates a <a href="#clock" class="glossary-link"><strong id="clock-definition">Clock</strong></a> with several segments.
        Successful Checks tick the Clock forward; failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Clocks when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Characters are working toward a long‑term goal, such as investigating a mystery or repairing a ship.</li>
        <li>A danger is mounting over time, such as a collapsing tunnel, spreading fire, or advancing enemy force.</li>
        <li>Two or more forces are racing toward different outcomes (opposing Clocks).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Clock and Checks</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.<br />
        <em>Clocks:</em> “Evacuation Complete” (6 segments) and “Flood Waters Rise” (4 segments).<br />
        <em>Rolls:</em> Each scene, characters make MIG, AGI, PRE, or RSN Checks based on their chosen
        contributions—lifting sandbags, coordinating crowds, analyzing routes. Successes advance the evacuation
        clock; failures or partials tick the flood clock or create new complications.<br />
        <em>Outcome:</em> Which clock fills first determines whether the district is saved, partially saved, or
        overwhelmed.
      </div>

      <h3 id="keeping-momentum">Keeping Momentum</h3>
      <p>
        Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action.</li>
        <li>Let Failures create new problems, reveal information, or shift the situation rather than blocking
          all paths.</li>
        <li>Allow retries only when the circumstances or approach meaningfully change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is not to punish characters for rolling poorly. The goal is to discover what happens next when
        risk meets intent. If the table keeps that in view, Checks will feel like natural beats in the story
        rather than interruptions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-09-tags-conditions-clocks">
      <h2 id="tags-conditions-clocks-heading">9. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks</h2>

      <p>
        Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive.
        They connect description to mechanics so that rain, fear, injuries, crowds, and looming deadlines all
        matter at the table. This chapter explains what each of these tools is for, how to use them, and how
        they interact with Checks.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tags-vs-conditions">Tags vs. Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="#tag" class="glossary-link"><strong id="tag-definition">Tags</strong></a> describe <strong>the environment or situation</strong>. They belong to places, scenes, objects, or
        circumstances: <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Slick</em>, <em>Crowded</em>, <em>Fragile Cover</em>. Tags affect
        what you can do in a space and how you do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#condition" class="glossary-link"><strong id="condition-definition">Conditions</strong></a> describe <strong>your character's state</strong>. They follow you from one location to the
        next until cleared: <em>Exhausted</em>, <em>Bleeding</em>, <em>Frightened</em>, <em>Restrained</em>.
        Conditions affect your actions wherever you go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions are the shared vocabulary the table uses to talk about advantages, risks, and
        lingering consequences. They are not extra subsystems to memorize. They are the names you give to
        things you are already describing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-tags-do">What Tags Do</h3>
      <p>
        A Tag is a short descriptor applied to a scene, location, object, or situation. It becomes a flag:
        “remember this when resolving actions here.” Tags typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grant Edge or Burden on certain Checks.</li>
        <li>Raise or lower DCs for specific actions.</li>
        <li>Change risk or impact (how risky an action feels or how big its impact is).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You do not tag every detail. A room is just a room until its darkness, instability, crowd, or sacred
        significance matters to what characters are attempting. Tag the things that will shape decisions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="common-tag-categories">Common Tag Categories</h3>
      <p>
        While Chapter 18 provides an extended reference, this chapter introduces three broad categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Environmental Tags</strong> – Physical features of space: <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Slick</em>,
          <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Elevated</em>, <em>Solid Cover</em>, <em>Fragile Cover</em>, <em>Unstable</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Situational Tags</strong> – Circumstances and pressures: <em>Crowded</em>, <em>Alert</em>,
          <em>Hazardous</em>, <em>Obscured</em>, <em>Surveillance</em>, <em>Networked</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Atmospheric Tags</strong> – Social or emotional tone: <em>Tense</em>, <em>Festive</em>,
          <em>Solemn</em>, <em>Suspicious</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can invent new Tags that fit your setting. The important part is agreeing at the table what a Tag
        does in practice: which actions it helps, which it hinders, and how it shapes consequences.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Tags in a Warehouse Fight</strong><br />
        The GM describes a warehouse full of stacked crates, narrow aisles, and oil-spotted floors. They assign
        the Tags <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Fragile Cover</em>, and <em>Slick</em>.<br />
        <em>Cramped</em> makes wide swings and large weapons awkward. <em>Fragile Cover</em> means wooden crates
        can be shredded by fire, potentially stripping cover away. <em>Slick</em> imposes Burden on fast
        movement or acrobatic maneuvers. Every decision in this scene now has texture.
      </div>

      <h3 id="what-conditions-do">What Conditions Do</h3>
      <p>
        Conditions represent persistent states that modify what a character can safely attempt. They are the
        mechanical mark left by consequences. When something important happens to you—injury, fear, strain,
        affliction—it often becomes a Condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conditions typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Impose Burden on certain actions.</li>
        <li>Limit available options (cannot run, cannot act this turn, cannot speak clearly).</li>
        <li>Threaten further harm if ignored (ongoing damage, ticking Clocks).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="examples-of-common-conditions">Examples of Common Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        A full alphabetical list appears in the Glossary. Here are a few you will see often:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#exhausted" class="glossary-link"><strong>Exhausted</strong></a> – Burden on demanding physical actions until you rest or receive
          meaningful aid.</li>
        <li><a href="#bleeding" class="glossary-link"><strong>Bleeding</strong></a> – Time pressure from an untreated wound. If not stabilized, it may tick a
          personal Clock or escalate to worse states.</li>
        <li><a href="#restrained" class="glossary-link"><strong>Restrained</strong></a> – You are held or pinned. You cannot move freely and must break free or
          be helped.</li>
        <li><a href="#dazed" class="glossary-link"><strong>Dazed</strong></a> – Disoriented; Burden on perception and reaction until you recover.</li>
        <li><a href="#frightened" class="glossary-link"><strong>Frightened</strong></a> – Burden on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when
          you rally, escape, or defeat the source.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – From Event to Condition</strong><br />
        A character fails a Check while crossing a compromised catwalk. Rather than simple damage, the GM
        describes how they slam into the railing and twist their knee. They gain the Condition
        <em>Exhausted</em> or <em>Weakened</em>, representing reduced stamina. Future physical actions are harder
        until they rest or receive treatment.
      </div>

      <h3 id="using-tags-and-conditions-with-checks">Using Tags and Conditions with Checks</h3>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions do not require new rules. They plug directly into the Check system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tags often grant Edge or Burden on Checks that interact with them.</li>
        <li>Conditions usually impose Burden or limit which approaches are reasonable.</li>
        <li>Some Tags shift DCs or change risk and impact instead of modifying dice directly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you are about to roll, quickly review which Tags and Conditions are relevant. Ask: “Does this make
        the action easier, harder, or riskier?” Then adjust Edge/Burden, DC, or consequences
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Tag and Condition Interaction</strong><br />
        In a horror‑tinged mystery, a character stalks through a foggy graveyard at night. The scene has Tags
        <em>Dim Light</em> and <em>Obscured</em>. The character is also <em>Frightened</em> from a previous
        encounter.<br />
        When they attempt to sneak past patrolling figures, <em>Dim Light</em> and <em>Obscured</em> might grant
        Edge on Stealth, but <em>Frightened</em> could impose Burden on actions taken while the threat
        is visible. The GM weighs these factors, cancels opposing modifiers as needed, and describes how the
        character’s shaky nerves show up in the fiction.
      </div>

      <h3 id="introducing-and-clearing-conditions">Introducing and Clearing Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Conditions should follow naturally from events. A failed Check in a hazardous area might cause
        <em>Bleeding</em> or <em>Poisoned</em>. Exposure to overwhelming sights might cause <em>Frightened</em>.
        Pushing beyond safe limits might cause <em>Exhausted</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you introduce a Condition, state:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What it represents in the fiction.</li>
        <li>How it affects actions (which Checks it modifies and how).</li>
        <li>How it can be cleared (time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Minor Conditions should clear quickly once addressed. Major Conditions may persist across several scenes
        or form the basis for character‑driven goals.
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-clocks-are">What Clocks Are</h3>
      <p>
        Clocks are segmented trackers that answer “how close are we?” for goals and threats. A Clock is a circle
        or track divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments. As actions succeed, time passes, or events occur, segments
        fill. When the Clock completes, something happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Clocks to represent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Long‑term goals</strong> – Research projects, faction plans, character endeavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Mounting threats</strong> – Approaching storms, advancing enemies, spreading plagues.</li>
        <li><strong>Ticking dangers</strong> – Rituals completing, bombs counting down, collapsing structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Faction projects</strong> – Off‑screen activities of NPCs and organizations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="advancing-clocks">Advancing Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Clocks advance in several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Success‑based</strong> – Successful Checks tick a project Clock forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Time‑based</strong> – Segments fill as scenes pass or as in‑world time moves.</li>
        <li><strong>Event‑based</strong> – Specific narrative events advance background or faction Clocks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Partial successes often advance a Clock and introduce a complication. Exceptional successes may jump a
        Clock by more than one segment. Failures might leave a Clock unchanged while pushing forward a related
        threat Clock.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Investigation and Cover‑Up Clocks</strong><br />
        The group is investigating a corrupt official.</div>
      <p>
        The GM creates an “Expose the Official” Clock with 6 segments and a “Cover‑Up” Clock with 4 segments.
        Successful RSN‑based investigation, social, or infiltration Checks advance the first Clock. Certain
        failures, loud approaches, or conspicuous visits advance the second. Which Clock fills first determines
        whether the truth comes out cleanly, is revealed with fallout, or is buried.
      </p>

      <h3 id="combining-tags-conditions-clocks">Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        These tools are most powerful when used together:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tags set the stage: terrain, lighting, crowds, magical effects.</li>
        <li>Conditions show how previous events cling to characters and shape their options.</li>
        <li>Clocks track momentum toward outcomes that matter over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A single scene might involve a <em>Hazardous</em> Tag, characters who are <em>Exhausted</em>, and a
        “Structural Collapse” Clock. Every roll becomes a meaningful choice about risk, effort, and timing.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Start Small</strong>
        You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene. Start with one or two Tags that matter, a
        few Conditions that arise naturally, and a single important Clock. Add more only when they clarify the
        fiction rather than clutter it. When in doubt, ask: “Does this tool make the situation clearer and more
        interesting?” If yes, use it.
      </div>

    <section id="ch-10-combat-basics">
      <h2 id="combat-basics-heading">10. Combat Basics</h2>

      <p>
        Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already
        learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical
        choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core
        combat actions to shape the fiction.
      </p>

      <h3 id="combat-as-a-scene">Combat as a Scene</h3>
      <p>
        Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment‑to‑moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does
        not call for “initiative” the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know
        who acts in what order and how threats respond.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table can always ask, “Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?” Use
        structured turns when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.</li>
        <li>Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.</li>
        <li>Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration.
        Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free
        narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate “combat mode.”
      </p>

      <h3 id="resolve-instead-of-hit-points">Resolve Instead of Hit Points</h3>
      <p>
        The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close
        someone is to being taken out of a fight.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resolve Clocks</strong> track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC, or enemy can absorb
          before they are out of the scene.</li>
        <li><strong>Conditions</strong> such as <em>Bleeding</em>, <em>Exhausted</em>, or <em>Stunned</em> mark
          lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your
        opponent’s Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse,
        depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.
      </p>

      <h4 id="why-clocks-not-hit-points">Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?</h4>
      <p>
        Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fiction first</strong> – A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an
          arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at “0 HP.”</li>
        <li><strong>Visible progress</strong> – A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone
          can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible stakes</strong> – Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or
          killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.</li>
        <li><strong>Pacing control</strong> – The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick,
          cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and
        Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they
        become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and
        story rather than pure attrition.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Enemy Resolve</strong><br />
        A dangerous VPC has a 6‑segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective
        Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM
        describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of
        the fight in a way that fits the story.
      </div>

      <p>
        Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being
        taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what “taken out” means in this scene. Are you
        trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes
        depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises
        about consequences.
      </p>

      <h3 id="turns-and-order">Turns and Order</h3>
      <p>
        Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach
        that fits the scene:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conversational order</strong> – The GM asks “Who acts next?” and rotates spotlight. Simple
          and flexible for small skirmishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Popcorn order</strong> – After you resolve your turn, you choose who goes next. This keeps
          attention moving and avoids predictable patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Initiative (optional)</strong> – If the table prefers, you can use a simple initiative roll
          or fiction‑based ordering for more structure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands
        who is up next.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order</strong><br />
        A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles
        a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all
        want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, “We’re in structured turns
        now,” and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.
      </div>

      <h3 id="your-turn-structure">Your Turn: Structure and Options</h3>
      <p>
        On your turn, you usually:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe what you do in the fiction.</li>
        <li>Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).</li>
        <li>Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw
        a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters,
        it often fits into the same turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act
        and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they
        are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-combat-actions">Core Combat Actions</h3>
      <p>
        Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strike</strong> – Directly attack a target.</li>
        <li><strong>Maneuver</strong> – Change position, create openings, or control space.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up</strong> – Create Edge or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.</li>
        <li><strong>Defend / Withdraw</strong> – Protect yourself or break contact to recover.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="action-strike">Strike</h4>
      <p>
        Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot,
        hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on
        your opponent’s awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial
        Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become <a href="#exposed" class="glossary-link"><em>Exposed</em></a>, suffer a counterblow,
        or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your
        opponent a positional or narrative advantage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against
        tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you
        commit to repeated Strikes.
      </p>

      <h4 id="action-maneuver">Maneuver</h4>
      <p>
        Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an
        enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside
        a weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can
        create <a href="#prone" class="glossary-link"><em>Prone</em></a>, strip <em>Solid Cover</em>, or apply a useful Tag such as <em>Exposed</em> that
        allies can exploit on later turns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a
        doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a
        rope bridge. In sci‑fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single
        Strike.
      </p>

      <h4 id="action-setup">Set Up</h4>
      <p>
        Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting
        to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you
        grant Edge or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the
        opening but at some cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike
        chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Edge you create.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher‑tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect
        the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better
        positions, cover, and Edge, Strikes become dramatically more effective.
      </p>

      <h4 id="action-defend-withdraw">Defend / Withdraw</h4>
      <p>
        Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover,
        blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach
        a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition
        or yielding ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using
        Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or
        surviving to fight another day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it,
        the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from “win here” to “escape, regroup, or change the
        stakes.” Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="positioning-and-environment">Positioning and Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Tags play a major role in combat. <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Elevated</em>,
        <em>Fragile Cover</em>, <em>Slick</em>, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or
        change what is possible at all. Manege position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Using the Battlefield</strong><br />
        In a rooftop fight marked as <em>Elevated</em> with scattered <em>Fragile Cover</em>, one character uses
        Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting
        Edge on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats <em>Elevated</em> as granting Edge on ranged attacks
        from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.
      </div>

      <h3 id="conditions-in-combat">Conditions in Combat</h3>
      <p>
        Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being <a href="#stunned" class="glossary-link"><em>Stunned</em></a> by a concussive blast,
        <em>Bleeding</em> after a severe hit, or <em>Suppressed</em> by incoming fire. These Conditions modify
        subsequent Checks and shape choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be
        cleared. For example, <em>Stunned</em> might end after you lose your next action, while
        <em>Exhausted</em> may persist until you rest between scenes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both <em>Bleeding</em> and
        <em>Exhausted</em> is under pressure each round and rolling with Burden on many actions. Scenes
        like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.
      </p>

      <h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting It Together</h3>
      <p>
        A typical combat turn might look like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.</li>
        <li>You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.</li>
        <li>The GM sets DC, notes any Edge/Burden, and clarifies stakes.</li>
        <li>You roll <strong>4d6</strong>, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.</li>
        <li>The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when
        Edge and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions
        when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a
        series of disconnected attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs,
        VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre‑flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep
        the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-11-exploration-social-play">
      <h2 id="exploration-social-play-heading">11. Exploration and Social Play</h2>

      <p>
        Exploration and social play cover everything that happens outside of direct combat. Investigating crime
        scenes, navigating dangerous terrain, decoding signals, negotiating alliances, and reading a crowded
        room all use the same core mechanics—Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on discovery, choice,
        and momentum rather than immediate harm.
      </p>

      <h3 id="exploration-overview">Exploration Overview</h3>
      <p>
        In exploration scenes, the GM presents situations, spaces, and mysteries. Players describe what their
        characters do: search, travel, tinker, observe, or test. When uncertainty, consequence, and agency are
        present, a Check resolves whether the attempt reveals information, overcomes an obstacle, or creates a
        new problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploration is not “filler between fights.” It is where many campaigns decide their tone: cozy
        neighborhood investigations, tense horror crawls, sprawling journeys, or intricate political maneuvering.
        Treat exploration choices as meaningful as any combat decision.
      </p>

      <h3 id="investigation-and-discovery">Investigation and Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        When investigating, start with a clear question: “What am I trying to learn?” Then describe how you
        pursue it. Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“I examine the desk for hidden compartments and false bottoms.”</li>
        <li>“I compare the shipping logs with telegraph records for discrepancies.”</li>
        <li>“I walk the perimeter, looking for unusual footprints or tool marks.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The GM chooses an Attribute and any relevant Skills, sets a DC based on how well‑hidden or complex the
        information is, and calls for a Check if needed. On a Full Success, you get a clear answer or strong
        lead. On a Partial Success, you learn something useful but pay a cost—time passes, someone notices, or
        the clue is incomplete. On a Failure, you miss the key detail or trigger a complication.
      </p>

      <p>
        Investigation often uses paired Clocks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Progress Clocks</strong> for goals such as “Identify the culprit,” “Decode the pattern,” or
          “Map the tunnels.” Successful Checks tick these forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure Clocks</strong> for dangers such as “Guards return,” “Evidence destroyed,” or
          “Storm closes in.” Partial successes and Failures may tick these.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Dual Investigation Clocks</strong><br />
        The group investigates a sabotaged telegraph relay. The GM creates a 6‑segment “Find the saboteur” Clock
        and a 4‑segment “Relay shutdown” Clock. Each successful RSN‑based Check (examining equipment, tracing
        messages, interviewing operators) advances the first. Certain Failures or time‑consuming approaches tick
        the second. Which fills first determines whether the saboteur is exposed before the network goes dark.
      </div>

      <h3 id="travel-and-environmental-challenges">Travel and Environmental Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Journeys, hazardous terrain, and environmental puzzles are handled with the same principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define the route, obstacles, and stakes.</li>
        <li>Assign Tags to the environment (<em>Slick</em>, <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Hazardous</em>,
          <em>Obscured</em>).</li>
        <li>Use Checks and Clocks to track progress and risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Long journeys can be condensed into a handful of key scenes. Each scene presents a meaningful choice: push
        for speed at higher risk, detour for safety at the cost of time, or engage with an opportunity or threat
        the GM introduces along the way.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Crossing the Floodplain</strong><br />
        The group must cross a floodplain before the next storm. The GM tags the region as <em>Hazardous</em> and
        <em>Unstable</em> and creates a “Reach Higher Ground” Clock and a “Waters Rise” Clock. Each scene, the
        players choose approaches—careful scouting, constructing makeshift bridges, or pushing through quickly.
        RSN, MIG, or AGI Checks advance progress or risk. Fictional choices about camps, supplies, and routes
        matter as much as the dice.
      </div>

      <h3 id="social-interaction">Social Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        Social scenes—persuasion, negotiation, deception, and reading people—use the same core loop:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clarify what you want from the other party.</li>
        <li>Describe your approach and how you present yourself.</li>
        <li>GM sets DC and Tags for the scene (<em>Tense</em>, <em>Festive</em>, <em>Suspicious</em>,
          <em>Profit‑Minded</em>).</li>
        <li>Roll Checks and interpret outcome tiers as changes in trust, position, or opportunity.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Presence‑based Skills often lead here, but other Attributes can matter. A Reasoned argument, a Might‑backed
        display of capability, or an Agility‑based demonstration can all shift attitudes when grounded in the
        fiction.
      </p>

      <h3 id="negotiation-and-leverage">Negotiation and Leverage</h3>
      <p>
        Effective negotiation starts with understanding what the other side values. Before making big offers,
        consider using Insight or similar approaches to read their priorities. Are they driven by profit, duty,
        fear, or reputation? Tags like <em>Profit‑Minded</em>, <em>Honor‑Bound</em>, or <em>Desperate</em> can
        help anchor these traits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you know what matters to them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identify leverage</strong> – information, access, protection, or resources that speak directly
          to their needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Frame your offer</strong> – present your proposal in terms of their goals, not yours.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Clocks for complex deals</strong> – “Deal Secured” or “Trust Established” can track
          multi‑round negotiations.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Multi‑Round Negotiation</strong><br />
        The group negotiates safe passage with a gang leader tagged as <em>Ruthless</em> and
        <em>Profit‑Minded</em>. Early rounds focus on proving value and reliability, filling a “Consider Their
        Offer” Clock. Later rounds solidify terms. Each Check can move the Clock forward or back, with Partial
        successes adding new demands or concessions. When the Clock completes, the leader commits to a course of
        action—ally, neutral, or rival.
      </div>

      <h3 id="deception-and-reading-people">Deception and Reading People</h3>
      <p>
        Deception is high‑risk and high‑reward. Successful lies open doors; failed lies create enemies. Keep lies
        simple, grounded in partial truths, and aligned with visible facts when possible. The GM may grant
        Edge when your story matches what NPCs can already see or believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading people through Insight or similar approaches lets you detect lies, gauge mood, and identify
        pressure points. On Full Success, the GM can tell you what an NPC most wants right now or what they are
        afraid will happen. On Partial Success, you get a rough sense with some uncertainty or risk being
        noticed.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Interrogation Contest</strong><br />
        A smuggler is captured in a quiet back room. First, intimidation fails to crack his loyalty, but ticks a
        Pressure Clock as his crew starts wondering where he is. Then the characters switch to deception,
        claiming his boss has already betrayed him. A contested Check between the character’s PRE‑based deception
        and the smuggler’s Insight decides whether he believes the story. The outcome determines whether he
        reveals the shipment’s location or shuts down entirely.
      </div>

      <h3 id="structuring-scenes-with-clocks">Structuring Scenes with Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Clocks are especially valuable in exploration and social play, where many small actions add up to big
        changes. Use them to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track layered goals (investigation, preparation, influence).</li>
        <li>Represent background events (faction plans, approaching deadlines).</li>
        <li>Create tension in otherwise open‑ended situations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many campaigns, the most memorable scenes are not single Checks but sequences where Clocks visibly
        advance, threats close in, and players make hard choices about which fronts to address first.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tying-exploration-and-social-back-to-combat">Tying Exploration and Social Back to Combat</h3>
      <p>
        Exploration and social play are not separate from combat—they shape it. Successfully mapping a site,
        securing allies, or learning an enemy’s habits can create Tags, Clocks, or Advantages that pay off
        immediately when blades are drawn. Likewise, the outcome of a fight often creates new questions to
        investigate or relationships to repair.
      </p>
      <p>
        When planning sessions, think in arcs: exploration reveals opportunities and risks, social play navigates
        them, and combat resolves the moments where words and careful planning are no longer enough. Then the
        story returns to exploration and social play, changed by what happened in the heat of the moment.

    <section id="ch-12-downtime-recovery-advancement-overview">
      <h2 id="downtime-recovery-advancement-heading">12. Downtime, Recovery, and Advancement Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Downtime and advancement connect sessions together. They answer two questions: what happens to characters
        between high‑pressure scenes, and how do they grow over time. This chapter provides an overview of
        recovery, downtime activities, and progression models. Later chapters and references expand each area in
        more detail.
      </p>

      <h3 id="downtime-overview">Downtime Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Downtime represents the hours, days, or weeks when characters are not in immediate danger. It is a space
        for rest, training, projects, and relationships. Good downtime:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lets characters recover from consequences and Conditions.</li>
        <li>Creates room for personal goals beyond the main plot.</li>
        <li>Seeds future adventures through projects and connections.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The GM and players decide how much in‑world time passes. A short downtime might cover a night between
        missions; a long one might span a season.
      </p>

      <h3 id="recovery-and-rest">Recovery and Rest</h3>
      <p>
        Rest is the foundation of recovery:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short rest</strong> – A few hours to catch breath, bind wounds, and clear minor Conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Long rest</strong> – A full night or more to reset after major exertion.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended downtime</strong> – Days or weeks that allow deep recovery, training, and projects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many Conditions clear automatically with appropriate rest: <em>Exhausted</em> fades after sleep,
        <em>Bleeding</em> resolves after treatment and time, minor <em>Frightened</em> states ease once the threat
        passes. More serious Conditions—<em>Poisoned</em>, <em>Cursed</em>, or long‑term injuries—may require
        specialized care, quests, or narrative solutions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="downtime-activities">Downtime Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond simple rest, characters can dedicate downtime to structured activities. Common examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Training</strong> – Practicing with mentors, refining Skills, or conditioning Attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Research</strong> – Studying lore, tracking rumors, or analyzing data.</li>
        <li><strong>Crafting</strong> – Building or modifying gear, tools, or infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships</strong> – Strengthening bonds with NPCs, factions, or communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Projects</strong> – Pursuing long‑term goals like founding a safehouse or establishing a
          network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each activity usually:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consumes a defined unit of downtime (a day, a week, a season).</li>
        <li>May involve one or more Checks, often against a progress Clock.</li>
        <li>Produces concrete outcomes: Skills gained, information uncovered, allies won, or structures built.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Training as a Clock</strong><br />
        A character seeks to learn a new Blades Skill from a retired duelist. The GM creates a 6‑segment “Train
        with Master Valen” Clock. Each week of focused training, the player rolls AGI or RSN against a moderate
        DC. Full successes tick 2 segments, partials tick 1. When the Clock fills, they gain the Skill and a new
        relationship with Valen as an ongoing contact.
      </div>

      <h3 id="long-term-projects">Long‑Term Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Some goals are too large for a single downtime period. Long‑term projects use bigger Clocks and are often
        tied directly to campaign arcs. Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishing a spy network in a city.</li>
        <li>Building or upgrading a stronghold.</li>
        <li>Rehabilitating a neighborhood or recovering from a disaster.</li>
        <li>Reconciling or reshaping relationships between factions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For each project, work with the GM to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define the end state (what “complete” looks like).</li>
        <li>Set a progress Clock sized to the goal.</li>
        <li>Identify key milestones or phases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Progress can come from downtime, on‑screen adventures, or both. Setbacks may create separate “Complication”
        Clocks that, if filled, delay or transform the project. Treat these as story opportunities rather than
        punishment.
      </p>

      <h3 id="relationships-factions-and-standing">Relationships, Factions, and Standing</h3>
      <p>
        Downtime is also when you invest in people. Characters can nurture friendships, manage obligations, and
        shift their standing with factions. Many groups find it helpful to track faction standing on a simple
        ladder:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hostile</strong> – actively opposed, may move against you.</li>
        <li><strong>Unfriendly</strong> – suspicious, minimal cooperation, inflated prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral</strong> – transactional; standard treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Friendly</strong> – helpful; discounts, information, and small favors.</li>
        <li><strong>Honored</strong> – invested in your success; serious support and protection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Significant actions—rescuing allies, defending territory, forwarding or opposing a faction’s goals—move
        standing up or down. Neglect can also matter; if you ignore an important relationship for a long time,
        the GM may introduce a Clock that tracks fading trust until you reconnect.
      </p>

      <h3 id="advancement-overview">Advancement Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Advancement represents mechanical growth: new Skills, expanded Proficiencies, and occasional Attribute
        improvements. It should also reflect narrative change: what your character has learned, how they have
        changed, and which arcs have moved forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three common progression models. Your table can use one or blend them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>XP‑based advancement</strong> – You earn experience points for overcoming challenges and
          achieving goals, then spend XP on Skills, Proficiencies, or Attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Milestone‑based advancement</strong> – You advance when you reach narrative milestones, such
          as completing arcs or defeating major threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Session‑based advancement</strong> – You advance after a set number of sessions, regardless of
          specific story beats.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Chapter 19, “Advancement and Long Term Growth,” provides detailed guidance, including costs, pacing, and
        genre‑specific advice. This chapter focuses on how advancement feels and how it connects to downtime.
      </p>

      <h3 id="narrative-arcs-and-growth">Narrative Arcs and Growth</h3>
      <p>
        Progression is most satisfying when mechanical changes follow narrative arcs. When you advance, ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What has my character learned or survived recently?</li>
        <li>How have their beliefs, relationships, or goals shifted?</li>
        <li>Which new capabilities reflect that change?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tie new Skills, Proficiencies, or Attribute bumps to concrete experiences in play: training scenes,
        pivotal choices, or climactic confrontations. This keeps growth feeling earned and grounded.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Advancement Tied to Arc</strong><br />
        After exposing a corrupt official and choosing to protect whistleblowers instead of seeking revenge, a
        character gains a social Proficiency focused on coordination and advocacy and a new investigative Skill.
        These advancements reflect their shift from lone operator to community organizer, making future scenes
        about those themes richer.
      </div>

      <h3 id="connecting-advancement-to-downtime">Connecting Advancement to Downtime</h3>
      <p>
        Downtime activities and advancement reinforce each other:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Training and projects can justify or accelerate new Skills and Proficiencies.</li>
        <li>Research and relationships can unlock opportunities that become advancement milestones.</li>
        <li>Long‑term projects can culminate in major advancement events (new Attributes, expanded domains).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When the table discusses advancement, consider what downtime scenes you want to play to show that growth.
        Likewise, when you plan downtime, think about which kinds of growth you hope it will make possible.
      </p>

      <h3 id="table-practices-for-downtime-and-advancement">Table Practices for Downtime and Advancement</h3>
      <p>
        A few simple practices keep downtime and advancement smooth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Talk about goals openly—what each player wants for their character between arcs.</li>
        <li>Choose a progression model together and revisit it if the pacing feels off.</li>
        <li>Use Clocks to track projects and relationships you care about, not every minor task.</li>
        <li>Let advancement decisions wait until you see how a story beat lands; pick changes that fit the outcome.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Downtime, recovery, and advancement are where the campaign breathes. Use them to give characters room to
        change, deepen ties to the world, and set up the next set of hard choices.

    <section id="ch-13-roleplaying-guidance-working-with-gm">
      <h2 id="roleplaying-guidance-working-with-gm-heading">13. Roleplaying Guidance and Working with the GM</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter focuses on how to play the game well at the table—how to inhabit your character, share
        spotlight, read the fiction, and collaborate with the GM and other players. The mechanics in earlier
        chapters provide tools. This chapter helps you use them in a way that keeps play fun, clear, and
        respectful for everyone.
      </p>

      <h3 id="roleplaying-fundamentals">Roleplaying Fundamentals</h3>
      <p>
        Roleplaying means making decisions from your character’s point of view. You do not need to speak in
        accents or stay “in character” every minute, but it helps to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Think about what your character wants, fears, and cares about.</li>
        <li>Let those priorities shape your choices, even when they are not tactically perfect.</li>
        <li>React to events as your character, not just as a player solving a puzzle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your goal is not to “win” the story. It is to help create a story that everyone at the table is excited
        to remember.
      </p>

      <h3 id="creating-memorable-characters">Creating Memorable Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Memorable characters often share three traits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distinct voice</strong> – A recognizable way of speaking or behaving.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear motivations</strong> – Goals and drives that explain why they act.</li>
        <li><strong>Flaws and strengths</strong> – Imperfections that create conflict and qualities that carry them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Voice can be as simple as a few phrases, a posture, or a habit. Motivations might be justice, curiosity,
        loyalty, or survival. Flaws—stubbornness, pride, mistrust—give scenes bite. Strengths—compassion,
        courage, expertise—give your character ways to shine.
      </p>

      <h3 id="engaging-with-the-fiction">Engaging with the Fiction</h3>
      <p>
        The game works best when everyone treats the fiction as real and worth caring about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Describe actions</strong> – Go beyond “I attack.” Show how you move, what you say, what it looks like.</li>
        <li><strong>React to outcomes</strong> – Let successes, partials, and failures change how your character feels and behaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Build on details</strong> – When someone adds a detail, treat it as a resource, not background noise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the GM says the tavern smells of smoke, decide whether that makes your character nostalgic, uneasy, or
        indifferent. Small reactions accumulate into a rich portrayal.
      </p>

      <h3 id="making-meaningful-choices">Making Meaningful Choices</h3>
      <p>
        Meaningful choices are grounded in both character and situation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask, “What would my character do here?” and take that seriously, even if it is risky.</li>
        <li>Embrace consequences; partial successes and failures are fuel for interesting scenes.</li>
        <li>Consider how your decision opens space for other characters to respond or grow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You always retain control over your character’s actions and internal life. The GM brings the world; you
        decide how your character engages with it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="roleplaying-in-different-scenes">Roleplaying in Different Scenes</h3>

      <h4 id="roleplaying-in-combat">Combat Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        Combat is not only about tactics. It is also about how your character responds to danger:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use your choices of Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, and Defend/Withdraw to show priorities—who you protect,
          what risks you accept.</li>
        <li>Let Conditions and Resolve Clocks show up in your description. Stagger when hurt, hesitate when
          <em>Frightened</em>, push through when it matters.</li>
        <li>React when others suffer; a quiet character might become decisive when an ally falls.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="roleplaying-in-social-scenes">Social Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        In social scenes, your words and posture matter. You do not have to improvise every line, but try to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Summarize what your character says, focusing on tone and intent.</li>
        <li>Show emotion through description—body language, pauses, eye contact.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to NPC reactions and adjust your approach when the fiction calls for it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="roleplaying-in-exploration">Exploration Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        Exploration scenes reveal what your character notices and cares about when there is no immediate threat.
        Curious characters poke at details; cautious ones check exits; idealists look for people to help. Use
        these scenes to reinforce who you are outside of crisis.
      </p>

      <h3 id="player-tips-for-success">Player Tips for Success</h3>
      <p>
        A few practical habits make play smoother and more satisfying. Taking five minutes before a session to
        review your character, their current situation, and what you want to pursue can make a big difference.
        Jotting simple notes—names, locations, promises—keeps threads from slipping away between games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many players find it helpful to set a small, personal goal each session: “I want to confront my mentor,”
        “I want to make peace with that faction,” or “I want to learn more about the vanished relay line.” These
        goals give the GM something to weave into scenes and help you decide what your character pushes toward
        when choices arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tactically, you do not need to master every rule to play well. Focus on three questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How can we use terrain and Tags to our advantage in this scene?</li>
        <li>Is anyone carrying dangerous Conditions we should clear or mitigate?</li>
        <li>What can I do this turn to make an ally’s next action stronger?</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – A Simple Plan</strong><br />
        Before a session, a player notes that their character wants to repair trust with a contact they previously
        lied to. When the GM frames a scene at that contact’s workshop, the player leans into it—offering a sincere
        apology and a concrete favor. The GM rewards this with a small improvement in standing and a future lead.
        A few minutes of preparation turned a casual scene into a memorable character moment.
      </div>

      <h3 id="reading-the-table">Reading the Table</h3>
      <p>
        Good play also means paying attention to the table, not just the fiction. When another player leans
        forward, takes notes, or lights up at a detail, that is a cue that this thread matters to them. When
        someone has been quiet for a while, you can create space for them with a simple question: “What is your
        character doing while this happens?”
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM’s descriptions are cues as well. If they linger on a Tag, repeat an NPC’s name, or mention a small
        oddity twice, it usually means that element is important. If you are unsure what a scene is about, ask
        briefly out of character: “What is at stake here?” Clarity helps everyone aim their actions in the same
        direction.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Inviting Someone In</strong><br />
        During an investigation scene, two players are debating theories while a third stays quiet. One of the
        debaters pauses and says, “You grew up in this district—what do you think is really going on?” The quiet
        player’s character suddenly becomes central to the scene, sharing local knowledge the others lacked. A
        small invitation shifted focus in a way that felt natural in the fiction.
      </div>

      <h3 id="spotlight-sharing-and-party-cohesion">Spotlight Sharing and Party Cohesion</h3>
      <p>
        Sharing spotlight keeps the game from becoming “the story of one character with supporting cast.” You do
        not need to track minutes of talk time, but it helps to be aware of patterns. If you have been at the
        center of the last few scenes, consider how your character might support others next—by asking for help,
        following someone else’s lead, or taking an assisting action instead of the decisive one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stepping forward and stepping back are both generous acts. Step forward when your character’s skills,
        history, or goals are central to the moment. Step back when someone else is in their focus scene and make
        their moment stronger with Set Ups, assistance, or simply by reacting in character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many tables like to create shared backstory—why the group is together, who they owe, what they have
        survived. These connections make it easier to care about one another’s scenes.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Supporting Someone Else’s Spotlight</strong><br />
        A session centers on another character’s estranged sibling arriving in town. Rather than trying to solve
        the sibling’s problems, the rest of the group plays into the situation: one offers quiet moral support,
        another runs interference with a suspicious faction, a third uses a Set Up action in a later conflict to
        give the spotlight character Edge. Everyone gets to act, but the emotional core of the session stays
        with the sibling relationship.
      </div>

      <h3 id="working-with-the-gm">Working with the GM</h3>
      <p>
        The GM is your collaborator, not your opponent. They present the world, frame situations, and play NPCs.
        You bring your character’s perspective and choices. Good collaboration looks like:
      </p>
      <p>
        Share your character’s goals and interests so the GM knows what to put on screen. Ask clarifying
        questions when stakes or details are unclear; it is better to pause for thirty seconds than to play
        through a scene everyone misunderstood. When consequences land, treat them as prompts for new choices
        rather than reasons to pull back from the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        If something at the table is not working for you—tone, pacing, or content—say so. Adjusting together is
        part of collaborative play.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Sharing a Goal</strong><br />
        A player tells the GM between sessions, “I want my character’s missing mentor to matter this arc.” A few
        sessions later, clues about the mentor’s fate appear in a side investigation. Because the player shared
        that interest, the GM could weave it into existing plots rather than guessing what would land.
      </div>

      <h3 id="session-zero-and-safety">Session Zero and Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Before a campaign begins, many groups hold a session zero to set expectations:
      </p>
      <p>
        Use this time to talk about tone (cozy, gritty, heroic, horrific), the kinds of stories you want, and
        content that is off‑limits or should be handled gently. Agree on how you will pause or check in if
        something feels uncomfortable. A few minutes of honest conversation can prevent misunderstandings later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safety tools can be as simple as an agreement to pause and talk when someone feels uncomfortable, or as
        formal as a written set of lines and veils. The important part is that everyone feels they can speak up.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Using a Safety Pause</strong><br />
        Midway through a tense interrogation, a player says, “Can we pause a second?” The table briefly steps out
        of character and the player explains that a specific detail is hitting too close to home. The group and GM
        adjust the scene—keeping the stakes, changing the flavor—and continue in a way that everyone can enjoy.
      </div>

      <h3 id="handling-disagreements">Handling Disagreements</h3>
      <p>
        Disagreements will happen, both in character and out of character. To keep them from derailing play:
      </p>
      <p>
        First, separate character conflict from player conflict. It is fine for characters to argue fiercely or
        make incompatible choices; it is not fine for players to feel attacked or sidelined. If a plan discussion
        stalls or tempers rise, step briefly out of character and ask, “What do we each want from this scene?”
      </p>
      <p>
        If needed, the GM can frame the stakes and ask for a decision so the story can move: “If you split the
        party here, these risks apply; if you stay together, you miss this opportunity. Which do you prefer?”
        Once a choice is made, treat it as a shared direction and see where it leads.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Resolving a Plan Disagreement</strong><br />
        Two players argue in character about whether to confront a faction now or gather more evidence. After a
        few minutes, a third player says, “Let’s pause—what do we want as players?” They discover one wants a
        tense confrontation, another wants to see more investigation scenes. Together with the GM, they decide to
        stage a smaller confrontation that reveals new clues, giving both desires some space.
      </div>

      <h3 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing It All Together</h3>
      <p>
        Roleplaying and collaboration are what turn mechanics into stories. Use the tools in this chapter to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Portray characters who change over time.</li>
        <li>Support one another’s arcs and share spotlight.</li>
        <li>Work with the GM to shape a campaign that reflects everyone’s interests and boundaries.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The rules in earlier chapters tell you how to resolve actions. This chapter is your reminder that how you
        choose those actions—and how you respond to the results—is just as important.

      <h1 id="part-ii-heading">Part II: Skills, Proficiencies, and Mechanical Reference</h1>
      <p>
        Part II explains the Skills and Proficiencies that give characters texture and focus, and collects key
        mechanical references used at the table. Skills represent what your character can reliably do under
        pressure; Proficiencies represent domains where their knowledge or training changes how the GM interprets
        the fiction. Extended Tags and Conditions, advancement options, and optional rules round out the
        mechanical toolkit.
      </p>
      <p>
        These chapters describe how to build and customize skill lists, how to group examples by Attribute and
        domain, and how to use mechanical references to tune campaigns. GMs and players can work together here to
        define new entries and options that fit the tone and needs of each table.

    <section id="ch-14-skills-system-overview">
      <h2 id="skills-system-overview-heading">14. Skills System Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Skills are fiction‑first capabilities that define what your character can reliably do when the outcome is
        uncertain. They represent practiced competencies—from climbing a precarious cliff to negotiating a trade
        deal, from repairing relay equipment to navigating orbital traffic. This chapter explains what Skills
        represent, how they interact with Attributes and Checks, and how to choose and create Skills that fit
        your campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-skills-represent">What Skills Represent</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="#skill" class="glossary-link"><strong id="skill-definition">Skills</strong></a> are not abstract numbers. They are grounded in your character's experiences, training, and
        environment. A character with Stealth knows how to move quietly, read patrol patterns, and exploit
        shadows. A character with Persuasion understands how to frame requests, read social dynamics, and build
        rapport. When you roll a Skill Check, you are asking: "Given who this character is and what the situation
        is, can they accomplish this goal?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills always operate on the fiction‑first principle introduced earlier:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the fiction does not support an action, no roll happens.</li>
        <li>If the action is certain to succeed or fail given the situation, the GM simply describes the result.</li>
        <li>Only when uncertainty, consequence, and agency align does a Skill Check come into play.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – When a Skill Matters</strong><br />
        In a cozy neighborhood campaign, a character with Baking might roll to impress a skeptical community elder
        with a carefully prepared cake, gaining Edge on future social scenes with that community. In a sci‑fi
        relay station, a character with Systems Diagnostics might roll to stabilize failing life support. Both are
        “skills,” but the way they appear in the fiction depends on the setting and the situation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-and-attributes">Skills and Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        Skills and Attributes work together. Attributes describe broad tendencies—Might (MIG), Agility (AGI),
        Presence (PRE), and Reason (RSN). Skills sharpen those tendencies into specific competencies. A Check
        typically uses one Attribute and, when appropriate, one Skill that fits the declared intent and approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same Skill can pair with different Attributes depending on how you act:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using Stealth with AGI when you move quietly through a crowded market.</li>
        <li>Using Stealth with RSN when you plan a route that avoids patrol patterns entirely.</li>
        <li>Using Persuasion with PRE when you speak with emotional conviction.</li>
        <li>Using Persuasion with RSN when you construct a careful, logical argument.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This flexibility keeps Skills tied to the story rather than locked into fixed formulas. The GM chooses
        the Attribute that best matches your described approach, then checks whether a Skill meaningfully applies.
      </p>

      <h3 id="skill-categories">Skill Categories</h3>
      <p>
        To make it easier to navigate options, Skills are loosely grouped into broad categories. These categories
        are descriptive, not restrictive, and can overlap:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exploration</strong> – Perception, Wayfinding, Investigation, Climbing, Tinkering.</li>
        <li><strong>Social</strong> – Persuasion, Negotiation, Insight, Deception, Comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical</strong> – Medicine, Thievery, Hacking, Engineering, Forensics.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict</strong> – Melee Combat, Firearms, Tactics, Zero‑G Combat, Crowd Control.</li>
        <li><strong>Arcane or Supernatural</strong> – Arcana, Occult Lore, Ritual, Divination.</li>
        <li><strong>Wilderness and Environment</strong> – Survival, Animal Handling, Gardening, Foraging.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Chapters 15 and 17 provide example Skills grouped by Attribute and domain, with genre‑specific lists you
        can use as written or adapt to your setting.
      </p>

      <h3 id="reading-skill-entries">Reading Skill Entries</h3>
      <p>
        Each Skill entry in the reference chapters follows a consistent structure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name and category</strong> – The Skill’s name and where it fits (Exploration, Social, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Description</strong> – A fiction‑first explanation of what the Skill covers and how it feels in play.</li>
        <li><strong>Default actions</strong> – Common tasks and typical DC ranges (using the standard DC ladder).</li>
        <li><strong>Synergies</strong> – Tags, Conditions, or Proficiencies that make this Skill more effective.</li>
        <li><strong>Counters</strong> – Situations or Tags that hinder the Skill.</li>
        <li><strong>GM usage notes</strong> – Advice on when to call for rolls and how to interpret outcome tiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Example</strong> – A short worked example showing the Skill in context.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you read a Skill entry, start with the description and example. They tell you how it shows up in the
        fiction. Numbers and DCs come after.
      </p>

      <h3 id="choosing-skills">Choosing Skills at Character Creation</h3>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, you select a small set of Skills that define what your character reliably does
        under pressure. When choosing Skills, keep four questions in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Does this fit the genre?</strong> A haunted relay station game will see more use from
          Engineering and Occult Lore than from Tournament Jousting.</li>
        <li><strong>Does this fit my concept?</strong> A former smuggler might take Navigation, Streetwise, and
          Deception; a village healer might focus on Medicine, Gardening, and Comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Does this complement the group?</strong> If no one has Medicine or Tactics, consider covering
          that gap. Redundancy can be fun, but shared blind spots are risky.</li>
        <li><strong>Is this a Skill I want to lean into?</strong> Choose Skills you are excited to see in play; you
          can grow into new areas later.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Selecting Skills for a Concept</strong><br />
        A player creates Rami, a courier who once worked the telegraph lines in a canyon region. They choose
        Stealth, Systems Diagnostics, Wayfinding, and Mediation. Stealth and Wayfinding reflect years of moving
        through rough terrain unnoticed. Systems Diagnostics ties into relay maintenance. Mediation represents
        their habit of smoothing over disputes between outposts. The Skill list says as much about who Rami is as
        their attributes do.
      </div>

      <h3 id="creating-custom-skills">Creating Custom Skills</h3>
      <p>
        The provided Skill lists are starting points. If a Skill you want is missing, you and your GM can create a
        custom one. A good custom Skill has a clear scope, fits your genre, and gives the GM obvious hooks for
        scenes where it matters. “Social Media Savvy” might be perfect for a modern campaign but feel out of
        place in a low‑magic village game; “Wayfinding” makes sense across many genres.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you design a new Skill together, start by writing a short description in plain language. Decide what
        kinds of actions it covers, what typical difficulties feel like, and what situations make it shine or
        struggle. You do not need to list every possible use; two or three concrete examples are enough to anchor
        the Skill in play.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Defining a Custom Skill</strong><br />
        In a modern investigative campaign, the group adds <em>Digital Forensics</em> as a Technical Skill.<br />
        <em>Description:</em> Analyze digital devices, recover deleted data, and trace online activity.<br />
        <em>Default actions:</em> Recover deleted files (DC 14–18), trace a message’s origin (DC 16–20), detect
        tampering (DC 12–16).<br />
        <em>Synergies:</em> Networked or Surveillance Tags, relevant Proficiencies like Cybercrime.<br />
        <em>Counters:</em> Air‑gapped systems, encrypted drives, Alert adversaries.<br />
        The GM now has a clear sense of when and how to call for Digital Forensics Checks.
      </div>

      <h3 id="designing-skills-for-your-campaign">Designing Skills for Your Campaign</h3>
      <p>
        When you add new Skills or reshape existing ones, think about how they will read on a character sheet and
        how they will show up in play. A strong Skill name hints at what the character does in scenes, not just
        which numbers they add to a roll. “Crowd Control,” “Wayfinding,” or “Social Media Savvy” all suggest
        specific kinds of moments; “+2 Physical” does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a rule of thumb when designing Skills:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lead with actions.</strong> Choose names that describe what characters do: “Calibrating Sensors,” “Negotiating Contracts,” “Reading People,” “Improvised Repairs.”</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid totalizing labels.</strong> “All Combat” is too broad. “Close‑Quarters Struggle” and “Ranged Technique” are narrow enough to feel distinct but broad enough to recur.</li>
        <li><strong>Differentiate by approach, not target.</strong> “Lockpicking” and “Fine Manipulation” overlap; consider whether you want a general Skill or a specialized one and how each will feel in multiple scenes.</li>
        <li><strong>Check against Proficiencies.</strong> If a proposed Skill sounds more like a job (“Harbor Operations”) than a repeatable action, it might belong as a Proficiency instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for genre hooks.</strong> Ask yourself which environments, factions, or threats will regularly invite this Skill to the forefront.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also collaborate with your group to build short campaign‑specific Skill menus. A cozy neighborhood
        game might highlight Skills like Baking, Comfort, Streetwise, and Community Mediation. A horror‑mystery
        game might focus on Investigation, Forensics, Occult Lore, and Crisis Negotiation. The mechanical
        structure stays the same; the Skill names and examples shift to match the tone, scale, and stakes of the
        stories you want to tell.
      </p>

      <h3 id="skills-proficiencies-tags-and-conditions">Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Skills rarely act alone. Proficiencies deepen them, Tags color the environment around them, and Conditions
        bend them out of shape. A Proficiency in a particular domain often makes related Skill Checks easier or
        safer. Tags such as <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Cramped</em>, or <em>Networked</em> tilt odds toward or away
        from certain Skills. Conditions like <em>Exhausted</em> or <em>Frightened</em> can narrow which approaches
        remain reasonable, even when you technically have the Skill.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Skill with Proficiency and Tags</strong><br />
        A character with the Systems Diagnostics Skill and the “Telegraph Instruments” Proficiency attempts to
        stabilize a failing relay in a canyon station. The scene has the Tags <em>Dim Light</em> and
        <em>Unstable</em> due to flickering lamps and tremors.<br />
        The GM decides the Proficiency lowers the effective DC and grants Edge on RSN + Systems Diagnostics
        Checks. However, <em>Unstable</em> means failures may tick a “Structural Collapse” Clock. The Skill,
        Proficiency, and Tags combine to make the moment specific and tense.
      </div>

      <h3 id="using-the-skill-reference-chapters">Using the Skill Reference Chapters</h3>
      <p>
        The chapters that follow provide concrete Skill lists and examples. Chapter 15 groups Skills by Attribute
        and offers sample entries you can adopt or adapt. Chapter 17 does the same for Proficiencies, showing how
        they sharpen certain Skills or open new options in the fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not need to memorize every entry. When you create or advance a character, scan the parts that match
        your campaign’s tone and pick what supports your concept. During play, treat the lists as inspiration. If
        you describe an approach that fits the fiction, you and the GM can decide together which Skill applies,
        even if it is not on a printed menu.
      </p>

      <h2 id="skills-reference-by-attribute-heading">15. Skills Reference</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter offers example Skills grouped by Attribute. It is not an exhaustive catalog. Instead, it
        shows the kinds of capabilities that naturally lean on Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Presence (PRE), and
        Reason (RSN), with short descriptions and sample uses. After each group, a few Skills are expanded into
        detailed entries that follow the structure described in the previous chapter.
      </p>

      <h3 id="skills-mig">Might (MIG) Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Might‑leaning Skills focus on strength, endurance, and direct physical effort. They often appear when you
        push, lift, resist, or endure things that would overwhelm most people. MIG Skills are not just about
        violence—they also cover hard labor, rescue work, and physically demanding crafts.

      <h4 id="skill-athletic-movement">Athletic Movement — Exploration / Conflict (MIG)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Athletic Movement covers running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and other full‑body movement under pressure. Characters with this Skill know how to conserve momentum, balance speed and safety, and read terrain for opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Climbing rough surfaces, crossing gaps, sprinting through unstable ground, or swimming against a current. Routine efforts in good conditions might be DC 12–14; risky leaps in bad weather or climbs while encumbered may push DCs into the 16–20 range.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags like <em>Cramped</em> or <em>Unstable</em> make movement riskier, while secure anchor points or safety gear can justify Edge. Conditions such as <em>Exhausted</em> or <em>Injured</em> often impose Burden or raise effective DCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use this Skill when movement itself is the source of tension. Partial successes are good places to introduce new Tags or tick environmental Clocks—reaching the ledge but dislodging debris, for example.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Athletic Movement</strong><br />
        The group needs to cross between two rooftops before a patrol arrives. The gap is wide, the night is rainy, and the Tag <em>Slick</em> is in play. The GM calls for a MIG + Athletic Movement Check at DC 16. On a Full Success, the character clears the gap cleanly. On a Partial Success, they make it but knock tiles loose, adding <em>Unstable</em> to the landing roof and ticking a “Guards Alerted” Clock by one.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-heavy-lifting-carrying">Heavy Lifting &amp; Carrying — Exploration / Support (MIG)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Heavy Lifting &amp; Carrying represents moving, bracing, and stabilizing heavy loads without specialized machinery. Characters with this Skill know how to use leverage, footing, and teamwork to keep weight under control.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Shifting debris, hauling injured allies, or relocating bulky equipment. Clearing a simple blockage with time and help might sit at DC 12–14; lifting or holding something that is actively collapsing, burning, or unstable often reaches DC 16–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags like <em>Solid Cover</em>, <em>Stable</em> surfaces, or access to proper tools can justify Edge or lower DCs. <em>Unstable</em>, <em>Hazardous</em>, or <em>Cramped</em> spaces increase risk and may impose Burden, especially if characters are also <em>Exhausted</em> or <em>Injured</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Treat Heavy Lifting as a chance to spotlight physical heroism and teamwork. On a Partial Success, consider progress with escalating danger—weight shifts, Clocks tick on structural collapse, or someone takes a Condition in exchange for getting others clear.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Heavy Lifting &amp; Carrying</strong><br />
        A maintenance platform buckles, pinning a worker beneath a support beam. The area is tagged <em>Hazardous</em> and <em>Unstable</em>. The GM calls for a MIG + Heavy Lifting Check at DC 18. A Full Success means the beam is raised long enough for the worker to scramble free, and the group retreats before the platform fails. On a Partial Success, the worker is saved but one PC gains the <em>Exhausted</em> Condition as the beam crashes down behind them.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-grit-endurance">Grit &amp; Endurance — Survival (MIG)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Grit &amp; Endurance measures how long your character can keep going under strain—physical, environmental, or emotional. It covers marathon efforts, holding a position under fire, and pushing through pain when others would stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Marching long distances, rowing for hours, or holding a barricade against repeated assaults. Routine but taxing efforts might be DC 12–14; extreme situations—days without proper sleep, brutal weather, or a siege—can push DCs to 18–22 and may call for repeated Checks over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Access to rest, food, medical care, or supportive Tags like <em>Sheltered</em> lower DCs or justify Edge. Stacking Conditions such as <em>Exhausted</em>, <em>Bleeding</em>, or <em>Frightened</em> makes continued effort much harder, often increasing DCs or turning Partial Successes into new Complications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use Grit &amp; Endurance Checks to mark the passage of grueling time. On Partial Success, let progress continue but introduce new Conditions or tick Clocks that reflect mounting strain, rather than simply ending the attempt.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Grit &amp; Endurance</strong><br />
        The party must hike through a wind‑scoured pass overnight to warn a nearby town. The GM sets a “Reach the Town Before Dawn” Clock and calls for a MIG + Grit &amp; Endurance Check at DC 14. On a Full Success, the group advances the Clock and arrives tired but ready. On a Partial, they still advance the Clock but one PC gains <em>Exhausted</em>, and another suffers <em>Frostbitten</em> fingers as an ad‑hoc Condition that will matter in later scenes.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-close-quarters-struggle">Close‑Quarters Struggle — Conflict (MIG)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Close‑Quarters Struggle covers grappling, shoving, restraining, and breaking free at arm’s reach. It is less about elegant martial arts and more about leverage, balance, and raw determination when the distance between combatants collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Holding someone back, escaping a grab, or wrestling over a weapon. Routine scuffles against untrained opponents might sit at DC 12–14; trying to restrain a prepared foe or overpower a larger opponent, especially in <em>Cramped</em> or <em>Crowded</em> conditions, can push DCs to 16–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags like <em>Crowded</em> or <em>Confined</em> may help a grappler who can pin foes against surfaces, while <em>Hazardous</em> terrain makes failed Checks more dangerous. Conditions such as <em>Restrained</em> or <em>Exposed</em> shape follow‑up actions, often granting Edge to allies or to the opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Grapples are great moments to bring Tags and Conditions into focus. On Partial Success, trade control back and forth—perhaps the PC restrains their foe but ends up positioned dangerously close to an edge or hazard.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Close‑Quarters Struggle</strong><br />
        In a maintenance corridor tagged <em>Cramped</em>, a saboteur lunges for the emergency release. A PC tackles them, triggering a MIG + Close‑Quarters Struggle Check at DC 15. A Full Success pins the saboteur, applying the <em>Restrained</em> Condition. A Partial Success stops the release but leaves both characters struggling, and the GM adds an <em>Exposed</em> Tag as security cameras pivot toward the scuffle.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-agi">Agility (AGI) Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Agility‑leaning Skills emphasize precision, balance, reflexes, and fine control. They cover stealthy
        movement, delicate manipulation, and actions where timing and positioning matter more than raw power. AGI
        Skills often determine who moves first, who avoids danger, and who can operate safely in constrained or
        unstable environments.

      <h4 id="skill-stealth-evasion">Stealth &amp; Evasion — Exploration / Conflict (AGI)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Stealth &amp; Evasion is the ability to move quietly, stay out of sight, and slip through gaps in attention. It includes reading patrol patterns, choosing routes, and using cover effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Crossing guarded spaces without being seen, hiding in cluttered environments, shadowing someone through a crowd, or breaking line of sight. DCs depend on alertness and environment: DC 12–14 for casual observation, 16–18 against active patrols or <em>Alert</em> Tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags like <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Crowded</em>, or <em>Obscured</em> often support this Skill, granting Edge or lowering effective DCs. <em>Alert</em>, <em>Surveillance</em>, or noisy gear can impose Burden or raise DCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> When a Stealth Check fails, think about how the story changes—guards might become suspicious rather than immediately sounding alarms, or a partial reveal might create a tense chase instead of a static fight.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Stealth &amp; Evasion</strong><br />
        A character tries to slip past a checkpoint in a foggy yard at night. The Tags <em>Dim Light</em> and
        <em>Obscured</em> are present, but the guards are on <em>Alert</em>. The GM calls for an AGI + Stealth &amp;
        Evasion Check at DC 16, ruling that the helpful Tags and the <em>Alert</em> state balance out. On a Full
        Success, the character passes unseen. On a Partial, they get through but one guard notices footprints in
        the mud, ticking a “Suspicion Rising” Clock.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-fine-manipulation">Fine Manipulation — Technical (AGI)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Fine Manipulation covers delicate handwork under pressure—picking locks, handling fragile instruments, and making precise adjustments in tight spaces. Characters with this Skill know how much force is safe, when to pause, and how to adapt when conditions change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Bypassing simple locks, repairing small mechanisms, or re‑routing cables in confined housings. Straightforward tasks with time and tools may be DC 12–14; rushed repairs in <em>Hazardous</em> or <em>Slick</em> environments, or on unfamiliar devices, can reach DC 18–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Good light, proper tools, and helpful Tags like <em>Stable</em> or <em>Secure</em> justify Edge or lower DCs. Poor lighting, vibrations, alarms counting down, or the <em>Cramped</em> Tag make success harder and elevate the consequences of failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use Fine Manipulation Checks when the details of a mechanism matter. On Partial Success, let the device function but introduce a side effect—extra noise, temporary instability, or a Clock that tracks hidden wear that will matter later.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Fine Manipulation</strong><br />
        A character hangs from a swaying catwalk, trying to reseat a relay plug before a safety Clock fills. The scene is tagged <em>Unstable</em> and <em>Hazardous</em>. The GM calls for an AGI + Fine Manipulation Check at DC 17. On a Full Success, the relay snaps into place and the alarms quiet. On a Partial, the relay works—but a shower of sparks ticks a “Fire in the Conduit” Clock by one.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-acrobatic-positioning">Acrobatic Positioning — Exploration / Conflict (AGI)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Acrobatic Positioning represents tumbling, vaulting, and using the environment to gain favorable positions. It is about turning ladders, ledges, and furniture into a playground that keeps you one step ahead of danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Sliding under closing doors, flipping over cover, or bouncing between balconies. Simple stunts with clear footing might be DC 12–14; long gaps, collapsing scenery, or zero‑G environments can push DCs to 18–22.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags like <em>Elevated</em>, <em>Crowded</em>, or <em>Solid Cover</em> can become assets if the character has room to maneuver. <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Slick</em>, or <em>Unstable</em> spaces make missteps more punishing and may turn failures into Falls or new Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use Acrobatic Positioning to reward creative descriptions of movement. On Partial Success, let the character gain position but at a cost—perhaps taking on the <em>Exposed</em> Condition, or ticking a Clock that tracks environmental collapse.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Acrobatic Positioning</strong><br />
        During a market‑square clash, a character uses stalls and awnings as improvised platforms. The GM calls for an AGI + Acrobatic Positioning Check at DC 15 to reach a hanging sign that provides <em>Elevated</em> firing position. A Full Success puts them safely atop the sign. On a Partial, they make it—but the sign’s supports strain, adding the <em>Unstable</em> Tag to their perch.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-ranged-technique">Ranged Technique — Conflict (AGI)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Ranged Technique is the practiced ability to place shots, throws, or other ranged effects exactly where they need to go. It covers judging distance, leading targets, and compensating for wind, recoil, or unusual angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Taking aimed shots, lobbing grenades or alchemical vials, or tossing grappling hooks. Routine shots at known ranges might be DC 12–14; difficult shots through <em>Obscured</em> areas, at long range, or while threatened often land around DC 16–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags like <em>Elevated</em>, <em>Stable</em> footing, or prepared sights can grant Edge. <em>Obscured</em> environments, <em>Slick</em> footing, or Conditions like <em>Shaken</em> or <em>Dazed</em> impose Burden or raise DCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Ranged Technique Checks are opportunities to show how the environment shapes combat. On Partial Success, consider outcomes like grazing hits that apply a Condition, or successful shots that also damage cover, adding new Tags to the battlefield.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Ranged Technique</strong><br />
        A character on a rooftop tagged <em>Elevated</em> tries to shoot out a cable anchoring a runaway tram before it derails. The GM calls for an AGI + Ranged Technique Check at DC 18, factoring in the tram’s speed and the stress of the moment. On a Full Success, the cable snaps cleanly and the tram grinds to a controlled halt. On a Partial, the cable is severed but the tram slams into a buffer, ticking a “Injured Passengers” Clock.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-pre">Presence (PRE) Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Presence‑leaning Skills are about influence, emotional resonance, and social navigation. They come to the
        forefront when your character speaks, negotiates, performs, or stands firm under social pressure. PRE
        Skills shape how NPCs and factions feel about you and how scenes change when you step in.

            <td><strong>Deception &amp; Performance</strong></td>
            <td>Presenting a convincing façade, playing roles, or masking intent.</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Insight &amp; Empathy</strong></td>
            <td>Reading people’s moods, motivations, and tells.</td>
            <td>Noticing when a witness is omitting something; sensing that a faction leader is more afraid than angry; spotting who in a crowd is truly listening.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4 id="skill-persuasion-appeal">Persuasion &amp; Appeal — Social (PRE)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Persuasion &amp; Appeal is the ability to convince others through argument, empathy, or shared interest. It helps you change minds or soften positions without deception.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Negotiating terms, calming frightened NPCs, or advocating for a course of action. Everyday requests might sit at DC 12–14; high‑stakes persuasion against resistant targets can reach DC 18–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Positive standing with a faction, prior favors, or supportive Tags (such as <em>Friendly</em> atmosphere) can justify Edge or lower DCs. Deep grudges, conflicting goals, or a <em>Tense</em> Tag make success harder.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use outcome tiers to adjust both content and tone of NPC responses. Partial successes might grant what the PCs want at a cost, such as obligations or strings attached.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Persuasion &amp; Appeal</strong><br />
        The characters ask a guild leader to delay a crucial shipment. The guild’s standing with them is
        <em>Neutral</em>, but they recently helped with a separate problem. The GM calls for a PRE + Persuasion
        Check at DC 16, noting that success means the delay is granted, while a Partial success means the delay
        comes with a promised favor the guild will collect later.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-command-coordination">Command &amp; Coordination — Social / Support (PRE)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Command &amp; Coordination is the ability to direct allies under pressure, align efforts, and keep a group focused on a shared goal. It is as much about clear communication and trust as it is about barking orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Organizing evacuations, coordinating tactics, or assigning roles during tense operations. Simple direction among willing allies might be DC 12–14; trying to coordinate panicked crowds or fractious factions can reach DC 18–20, especially when time is short.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Existing trust, clear plans, and stabilizing Tags such as <em>Organized</em> or <em>Prepared</em> can reduce DCs or justify Edge. Chaos, misinformation, or hostile Tags like <em>Panicked</em> or <em>Hostile Crowd</em> make success harder and magnify the cost of failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use Command &amp; Coordination Checks to decide how effectively groups move or act as a unit. On Partial Success, allow progress but with frayed edges—delays, miscommunications, or pockets of resistance that become hooks for future scenes.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Command &amp; Coordination</strong><br />
        A fire breaks out in a crowded depot. The GM tags the scene <em>Panic Rising</em> and calls for a PRE + Command &amp; Coordination Check at DC 15 as a PC tries to organize an orderly evacuation. A Full Success clears the station in time, stabilizing the situation. A Partial succeeds but leaves a side entrance jammed, ticking a “Trapped Workers” Clock the group must address later.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-deception-performance">Deception &amp; Performance — Social (PRE)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Deception &amp; Performance covers acting, misdirection, and presenting convincing façades. Characters with this Skill can lie smoothly, play roles, or put on shows that direct attention where they want it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Passing as someone else, staging distractions, or concealing true intentions in conversation. Simple lies with low stakes might be DC 12–14; intricate impersonations, long‑term cons, or bold public performances under scrutiny can hit DC 18–22.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Props, disguises, and supportive Tags like <em>Crowded</em> or <em>Festive</em> justify Edge. Informed audiences, existing suspicions, or Tags such as <em>Alert</em> and <em>Tense</em> push DCs higher, especially if the PCs are already <em>Marked</em> or <em>Exposed</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Deception Checks are a great place to lean on outcome tiers. Partial Success might buy time or partial belief while seeding later complications—NPCs who are unconvinced but play along, or an audience that enjoys the show but asks probing questions afterward.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Deception &amp; Performance</strong><br />
        To infiltrate a private gala, a PC poses as a visiting dignitary. The GM notes the Tags <em>Formal</em> and <em>Alert Security</em> and calls for a PRE + Deception &amp; Performance Check at DC 17. On a Full Success, the character passes inspection and gains access to the inner balcony. On a Partial, they are waved through but one guard quietly notes oddities in their story, ticking a “Security Suspicion” Clock.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-insight-empathy">Insight &amp; Empathy — Social (PRE)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Insight &amp; Empathy is the ability to read moods, notice unspoken tensions, and respond in ways that build connection. It helps you understand what people need or fear, even when they are not saying it directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Sensing when someone is lying by omission, recognizing when a negotiation is about pride instead of price, or spotting who in a group is closest to changing their mind. Everyday reads of open conversations may be DC 12–14; subtle deception, masked emotions, or cross‑cultural misunderstandings can push DCs toward 18–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Time spent listening, shared experiences, and quiet spaces can justify Edge. Distracting environments, <em>Tense</em> or <em>Hostile</em> Tags, or your own Conditions like <em>Frightened</em> or <em>Suppressed</em> make it harder to read others clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Insight Checks are ideal for revealing partial truths. On Partial Success, share honest but incomplete information or let the PC sense there is more beneath the surface, prompting further investigation or conversation.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Insight &amp; Empathy</strong><br />
        While negotiating with a faction envoy, a PC quietly watches body language instead of speaking much. The GM calls for a PRE + Insight &amp; Empathy Check at DC 14. On a Full Success, the PC realizes the envoy is more afraid of their own superiors than of the PCs, revealing a pressure point. On a Partial, they sense fear but misread its source, pointing suspicion at the wrong faction and seeding future complications.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-rsn">Reason (RSN) Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Reason‑leaning Skills focus on analysis, memory, perception, and structured thinking. They shine when you
        sift clues, diagnose problems, plan ahead, or notice what others overlook. RSN Skills often drive
        investigation, engineering tasks, and long‑term strategies.

            <td><strong>Lore &amp; Analysis</strong></td>
            <td>Recalling knowledge, interpreting texts, and applying theory.</td>

        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4 id="skill-investigation">Investigation — Exploration (RSN)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Investigation covers following leads, connecting evidence, and reconstructing events. Where Perception tells you what is present, Investigation helps you determine why and how.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Analyzing a crime scene, comparing records for inconsistencies, or tracing the path of a missing person. Straightforward inquiries might be DC 12–14; complex puzzles or well‑hidden schemes push toward DC 18–22.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Access to records, helpful NPCs, or prior research can lower DCs or justify Edge. Tags such as <em>Obscured</em>, <em>Hazardous</em> locations, or active Cover‑Up Clocks raise stakes and complicate interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Treat Investigation Checks as steps in a process, not single all‑or‑nothing gates. Use Clocks to track progress toward understanding, and let partial results reveal some truths while leaving room for future discoveries—or mistakes.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Investigation</strong><br />
        The group examines a sabotaged relay hub. The GM sets a 6‑segment “Understand the Sabotage” Clock and
        calls for an RSN + Investigation Check at DC 14. A Full Success both advances the Clock and clearly links
        the damage to a particular toolset. A Partial advances the Clock but hints at two possible culprits,
        leaving ambiguity the group will need to resolve later.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-perception-awareness">Perception &amp; Awareness — Exploration (RSN)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Perception &amp; Awareness represents noticing details, patterns, and subtle changes in your surroundings. It includes listening for unusual sounds, spotting movement at the edge of vision, and recognizing when something feels “off.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Hearing approaching footsteps, spotting hidden compartments, or noticing tampered equipment. Routine observations in quiet spaces might be DC 12–14; catching faint clues in <em>Obscured</em> or <em>Crowded</em> environments, or under time pressure, often climbs to DC 16–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags such as <em>Elevated</em>, <em>Well‑Lit</em>, or <em>Quiet</em> justify lower DCs or Edge. <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Obscured</em>, <em>Noisy</em>, or Conditions like <em>Dazed</em> or <em>Distracted</em> raise DCs and make Partial Success more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use Perception Checks to highlight how the world communicates with the PCs. On Partial Success, share useful but incomplete information—enough to prompt action, but not enough to eliminate all uncertainty.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Perception &amp; Awareness</strong><br />
        The group passes through a cargo bay tagged <em>Crowded</em> and <em>Noisy</em>. The GM calls for an RSN + Perception &amp; Awareness Check at DC 15 to notice signs of recent tampering. A Full Success spots tool marks near a concealed panel and a faint chemical smell. A Partial reveals only that crates near the panel have been rearranged, hinting that something is hidden but not exactly what.

      <h4 id="skill-systems-diagnostics">Systems &amp; Diagnostics — Technical (RSN)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Systems &amp; Diagnostics focuses on understanding and troubleshooting complex systems—mechanical, digital, magical, or social. It covers building mental models, tracing failure points, and predicting how changes will ripple through the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Tracing faults in relay networks, modeling faction responses, or identifying structural weak points. Simple troubles with clear symptoms might be DC 12–14; subtle glitches, layered conspiracies, or interlocking systems can push required DCs to 18–22 and may require multiple Checks over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Access to logs, schematics, or expert testimony lowers DCs or grants Edge. Tags like <em>Obscured</em> records, <em>Corrupted</em> data, or active sabotage Clocks raise stakes and may turn failure into cascading consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Systems Checks are natural moments to use Clocks that track understanding or system stability. On Partial Success, let PCs isolate some but not all issues, or solve one problem while planting the seeds of the next.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Systems &amp; Diagnostics</strong><br />
        After repeated brownouts, a PC reviews the station’s power map. The GM requires an RSN + Systems &amp; Diagnostics Check at DC 16. A Full Success identifies both the failing relay and a suspicious reroute that points toward sabotage. A Partial pinpoints the failing relay but misses the reroute, advancing a “Saboteur’s Plan” Clock off‑screen.
      </div>

      <h4 id="skill-lore-analysis">Lore &amp; Analysis — Knowledge (RSN)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Lore &amp; Analysis is your ability to recall information, interpret texts, and draw conclusions from recorded knowledge. It covers everything from local history and legal codes to arcane theory or xenobiology, depending on your setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Identifying symbols, recalling historical events, or interpreting research notes. Common references might be DC 12–14; obscure facts, deliberately hidden knowledge, or cross‑disciplinary questions can reach DC 18–22.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Access to archives, libraries, or mentors can lower DCs. Tags like <em>Restricted</em> or <em>Redacted</em> documents, or time pressure during research, raise difficulty and make Partial Success more attractive than outright failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use Lore &amp; Analysis Checks to feed players actionable context rather than trivia. On Partial Success, reveal one clear fact alongside a misleading implication or missing piece, inviting follow‑up scenes to refine the truth.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Lore &amp; Analysis</strong><br />
        Investigating an old faction sigil, a PC consults scattered notes from the Mechanics Reference era. The GM calls for an RSN + Lore &amp; Analysis Check at DC 15. A Full Success confirms the symbol belongs to an outlawed engineering guild and explains why their devices are so unstable. A Partial reveals the guild’s name and their reputation for dangerous experiments but omits that some of their techniques were quietly adopted by respectable institutions.
      </div>

      <h3 id="mixing-attributes-and-skills">Mixing Attributes and Skills</h3>
      <p>
        These examples show where Skills most often lean, but they are not rigid assignments. In play, you will
        often mix Attributes and Skills in flexible ways: a MIG‑focused character might pair Investigation with
        physical intimidation, while a PRE‑focused character might use Systems &amp; Diagnostics to explain a
        problem convincingly to a nervous crowd. When in doubt, start from the fiction: what is your character
        doing, and which Attribute and Skill combination best captures that attempt.
      </p>

      <h3 id="flexible-skills-case-studies">Case Studies: Flexible Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Many of the most memorable Skills are those that do not belong to a single Attribute. Instead, they
        describe broad approaches you can express in different ways. The Skill name stays the same, but the
        Attribute you pair it with shifts based on how you act in the scene. This keeps character concepts
        coherent across many situations without forcing you into the same kind of roll every time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are a few example Skills that are intentionally flexible. Use them as inspiration when creating your
        own:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Streetwise</strong> – Knowing where to go, who to talk to, and how to stay out of trouble in
          busy districts. You might roll 4d6 with PRE when buttering up a friendly barkeep, with RSN when
          piecing together rumors from scattered conversations, or with AGI when navigating rooftops and alleys
          to avoid patrol routes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Field Medicine</strong> – Stabilizing injuries with limited supplies. You might roll with MIG
          when physically hauling someone to safety while treating them, with RSN when diagnosing symptoms and
          choosing the right treatment, or with PRE when talking a frightened patient through a painful
          procedure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tinkering</strong> – Improvising, repairing, and re‑purposing devices. You might roll with RSN
          when methodically dissecting how a gadget works, with AGI when re‑wiring a delicate mechanism in a
          cramped space, or with MIG when physically bending frames and panels back into shape so the internals
          can function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wayfinding</strong> – Keeping your bearings over long journeys. You might roll with RSN when
          reading maps and stars, with MIG when pushing through harsh terrain and carrying gear, or with PRE when
          leading a group and keeping morale high through setbacks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None of these Skills are “owned” by a single Attribute. During play, you describe what you do; the GM
        chooses an Attribute that matches that approach and checks whether your Skill helps. Over time, this makes
        Skills feel like parts of your character’s story, not just fixed mechanical packages.
      </p>

    <section id="ch-16-proficiencies-system-overview">
      <h2 id="proficiencies-system-overview-heading">16. Proficiencies System Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Proficiencies represent your character’s narrative domain expertise—their trades, callings, and areas of
        practiced familiarity. Where Skills describe how you act under pressure, Proficiencies describe what you
        already know and can do without needing to reinvent yourself on the spot. A licensed engineer, a guild
        advocate, and a long‑haul caravan driver might share some Skills, but their Proficiencies mark out very
        different lived experiences.
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-proficiencies-represent">What Proficiencies Represent</h3>
      <p>
        A <a href="#proficiency" class="glossary-link"><strong id="proficiency-definition">Proficiency</strong></a> is more than a bonus—it is narrative permission. Being proficient in a domain means the GM
        can reasonably assume you understand its basics, jargon, and common risks. You know which questions to ask,
        which tools to reach for, and when a situation is outside your depth. In fiction, this might look like
        knowing how to secure a harness before climbing a relay tower, how to prepare a formal petition to a
        guild, or how to keep a steam engine from seizing during a storm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proficiencies often answer the question “Who gets to try this in the first place?” long before dice come
        out. In many situations, a Proficiency lets you bypass Checks entirely for routine tasks, or it sets a
        lower DC when you do roll because you are working from a position of experience rather than guesswork.
      </p>

      <h3 id="proficiencies-and-skills">Proficiencies, Skills, and Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies work together. Attributes describe raw tendencies; Skills describe
        trained competencies; Proficiencies describe domains where that training has been applied over time. When
        you roll 4d6 for a Check, you typically choose an Attribute and a relevant Skill. A Proficiency then
        shapes the fiction around that roll: it might justify Edge, lower the DC, or remove uncertainty for
        basic tasks entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, two characters might both have the Systems &amp; Diagnostics Skill. The one who is proficient
        in “Relay Station Operations” can read console layouts at a glance, knows local safety procedures, and
        has authority to access restricted areas. The other must ask more questions, rely on guesswork, and may
        face higher DCs or additional Clocks tracking social or procedural friction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not every Check involving a Proficiency grants a numeric bonus. Sometimes the benefit is access, reduced
        time, or the ability to attempt actions at all. Let the fiction and the stakes guide whether a
        Proficiency grants Edge, adjusts DCs, or simply removes the need to roll for standard situations.
      </p>

      <h3 id="types-of-proficiencies">Types of Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Proficiencies are intentionally broad so they can flex across settings. Common types include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Domain Proficiencies</strong> – Fields of knowledge or practice, such as Medicine, Arcane Studies, or Relay Engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>Tool and Equipment Proficiencies</strong> – Familiarity with particular implements, vehicles, or weapon classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Organization and Faction Proficiencies</strong> – Deep understanding of how a group operates, from city watch procedures to smuggling rings.</li>
        <li><strong>Role and Status Proficiencies</strong> – Experience tied to positions like Quartermaster, Scout Captain, or Court Envoy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You do not need to track every possible niche as a separate Proficiency. Start with a small set that says
        who your character is and what the campaign cares about, then expand as the story reveals new, enduring
        areas of expertise.
      </p>

      <h3 id="using-proficiencies-in-play">Using Proficiencies in Play</h3>
      <p>
        At the table, Proficiencies answer three questions: Who can attempt this? How hard is it for them? What
        happens if they get involved? When a situation touches a domain where a character is proficient, assume a
        higher baseline of competence, even before any dice hit the table. Routine tasks inside that domain often
        require no roll; they simply succeed, especially when there is no meaningful time pressure or opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the outcome is uncertain and meaningful, Proficiencies shape the Check rather than overshadowing it.
        A Proficiency might:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower an otherwise tough DC by one or two steps on the ladder (for example from 18 Hard to 14 Routine).</li>
        <li>Justify Edge on the 4d6 roll when the task is firmly inside the character’s field.</li>
        <li>Reduce the time required to attempt something, ticking progress Clocks more quickly.</li>
        <li>Unlock options that would otherwise be off‑limits, such as restricted procedures or specialized tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Proficiencies also interact strongly with Tags, Conditions, and Clocks. A proficient harbor master might
        treat a <em>Crowded</em> and <em>Noisy</em> dock as normal working conditions, while an untrained visitor
        finds their DCs raised or their Partial Successes much messier. Likewise, a character proficient in
        “Crisis Negotiation” might convert certain Failures into Partial Successes when talking down a threat,
        because they know how to keep the conversation going even when their first approach falters.
      </p>
      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Start with Permission</strong><br />
        When in doubt, treat Proficiencies as permission first and bonus second. Ask: “If no one at the table had
        this Proficiency, would this scene be possible in the same way?” If the answer is no, the Proficiency
        should change what the group can attempt, not just adjust numbers.
      </div>

      <h3 id="reading-proficiency-entries">Reading Proficiency Entries</h3>
      <p>
        Proficiency entries in the reference chapters mirror the structure of Skill entries, adapted for domain
        focus:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name and type</strong> – The Proficiency’s name and whether it is a domain, tool, organization, or role.</li>
        <li><strong>Description</strong> – What this expertise looks like in the fiction and how it shapes the character’s daily life.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope and examples</strong> – Typical situations where the Proficiency obviously applies, plus a few edge cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Default benefits</strong> – Ways it commonly affects Checks: reduced DCs, Edge in certain circumstances, or automatic success for routine tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Opportunities and risks</strong> – Story hooks the GM can use when this expertise is present in a scene.</li>
        <li><strong>GM usage notes</strong> – Guidance on when to ask for rolls, when to simply grant success, and how to model outcome tiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Example</strong> – A short scenario showing the Proficiency in action, from Trigger to Consequence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As with Skills, start with the description and example when you read a Proficiency entry. They show how
        the expertise changes scenes at the table; any bonuses or DC adjustments are there to support that story.
      </p>

      <h3 id="choosing-proficiencies">Choosing Proficiencies at Character Creation</h3>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, you select a small number of Proficiencies that answer the question “What do I
        already know how to do well?” These choices sit alongside your Skills and Attributes and should reflect
        your history, training, and the kinds of stories you want to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aim for Proficiencies that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fit your concept and the campaign’s focus.</li>
        <li>Offer clear, recurring hooks for the GM.</li>
        <li>Complement your Skills rather than duplicating them exactly.</li>
        <li>Say something about where you came from or who invested in your growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Talk with the GM and other players when choosing Proficiencies. Overlapping expertise can be fun, but
        shared blind spots—like a group with no one proficient in any kind of travel or logistics—will shape the
        tone of your campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="designing-proficiencies-for-your-campaign">Designing Proficiencies for Your Campaign</h3>
      <p>
        When you add new Proficiencies or adapt existing ones, aim for statements that are big enough to matter
        but small enough to feel distinct. “All Magic” is usually too broad; “Ritual Cartography of the Shattered
        Coast” may be too narrow for most scenes. A good Proficiency is something you expect to see at play at
        least a few times per arc, and that suggests concrete locations, NPCs, and problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a rule of thumb:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prefer phrases you could put on a business card.</strong> “Harbor Operations,” “Restoration Carpentry,” or “Court Etiquette” are all solid examples.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid pure mechanical labels.</strong> “+2 to Hacking” describes a bonus, not a story. “Relay Network Security” suggests both.</li>
        <li><strong>Check overlap with Skills.</strong> If a Proficiency sounds identical to a Skill, widen its scope or tilt it toward domain knowledge, contacts, or procedures.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for world hooks.</strong> Ask yourself which factions, locations, or front pressures would naturally involve this expertise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also collaborate to create campaign‑specific Proficiency lists. In a cozy slice‑of‑life game, you
        might see “Community Organizing,” “Bakery Management,” or “Local History.” In a horror‑mystery campaign,
        “Forensic Analysis,” “Occult Librarianship,” or “Missing Persons Desk” might emerge instead. The mechanical
        scaffolding stays the same; the labels change with the tone and focus of the series you are playing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="gaining-and-advancing-proficiencies">Gaining and Advancing Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Over time, you can gain new Proficiencies or deepen existing ones. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long‑Term
        Growth describes when these opportunities arise—often during Downtime, after major arcs, or as explicit
        rewards for in‑world training and mentorship.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you broaden a Proficiency, its scope in the fiction grows: your guild credentials might expand from
        a single district to the entire region, or your “Field Medicine” experience might become full medical
        training with access to formal facilities. When you deepen a Proficiency, its impact on Checks may shift:
        the GM might grant Edge more often, treat certain tasks as automatically successful, or allow you to
        teach others more efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proficiencies rarely stack into flat numeric bonuses. Instead, use them to decide who has access, whose
        word carries weight, and which characters can recognize danger before anyone else. Let them pull the
        story toward the areas of expertise your table cares about most.
      </p>

      <h3 id="genre-examples-of-proficiencies">Genre Examples of Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Because Proficiencies are narrative tools, they adapt easily across genres. A few possibilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cozy &amp; Slice‑of‑Life:</strong> “Neighborhood Fixer,” “Community Kitchen,” “Library Steward,”
          “Garden Planner.” These Proficiencies often bypass rolls for everyday tasks and shine when tensions
          threaten comfort or belonging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fantasy &amp; Mythic:</strong> “Temple Rites,” “Royal Heraldry,” “Monster Tracking,” “Enchanted
          Smithing.” Here, Proficiencies may frequently unlock access to sacred spaces, secret orders, or rare
          materials rather than simply modifying DCs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Horror &amp; Mystery:</strong> “Crime Scene Procedure,” “Urban Folklore,” “Cold‑Case Records,”
          “Sanitarium Administration.” These Proficiencies help stabilize investigatory scenes, reduce the risk of
          contaminating evidence, or warn the group about rituals and entities best left undisturbed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Modern &amp; Sci‑Fi:</strong> “Traffic Control,” “Vacuum Safety,” “Synthetic Biology Labwork,”
          “Civilian Station Logistics.” These often interact with large systems and Clocks, turning Proficiencies
          into levers the PCs can pull to redirect institutional behavior.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You do not need to memorize long lists to play. Instead, treat these genre examples as prompts: what kinds
        of jobs, institutions, and long‑term projects exist in your world, and which Proficiencies would make
        those things feel real and lived‑in when they appear at the table?
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Proficiency in Action</strong><br />
        A PC with the “Harbor Operations” Proficiency and the Systems &amp; Diagnostics Skill investigates a
        gridlocked port. The GM rules that routine scheduling tasks are automatic successes—no roll required—because
        the character knows the procedures. When they try to reroute traffic under pressure to prevent a collision,
        the GM calls for a PRE + Systems &amp; Diagnostics Check at DC 16. Their Proficiency justifies Edge
        on the 4d6 roll and reduces the time required, ticking a “Clear the Harbor” Clock twice on a Full Success
        and once on a Partial.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-17-proficiencies-reference-by-domain">
      <h2>17. Proficiencies Reference</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter presents example Proficiencies grouped by domain. Like the Skills Reference, it is not an
        exhaustive catalog. Instead, it shows the kinds of expertise that matter in play—operations, lore,
        medicine, security, and community—along with sample uses and a selection of detailed entries you can adopt
        or adapt for your own campaigns.

        Each table gives you four Proficiencies in a given area, with a brief explanation of what they represent

      <p>
        Operations and logistics Proficiencies cover the quiet work that keeps worlds moving: scheduling,

      <h4 id="prof-harbor-operations">Harbor Operations — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Harbor Operations represents deep familiarity with how ports function: who
        talks to whom, which documents matter, how tides and schedules intertwine, and where traffic jams and
        accidents are most likely. A proficient harbor operator reads crowded docks the way others read street
        signs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Scheduling berths, issuing or interpreting docking clearances,
        arranging tugs and pilots, and coordinating with customs or security. In play, this Proficiency covers
        things like re‑assigning incoming ships, managing evacuation routes, or spotting dangerous loading
        practices before they cause harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Routine harbor tasks—assigning a berth, arranging a standard off‑load,
        reading signal flags—rarely require a Check. When pressure mounts, Harbor Operations often lowers DCs for
        Logistics or Systems &amp; Diagnostics Checks, or grants Edge when re‑routing traffic under tight
        deadlines (for example, a Hard DC 18 task might become a Routine DC 14 with Edge).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Harbor Operations puts you near the heart of trade and travel.
        The GM can use this Proficiency to surface rumors, political pressure, smuggling attempts, and accidents.
        It also makes you visible: powerful factions may notice when you intervene too often or bend the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use this Proficiency to speed up scenes that would otherwise bog down in
        procedure. Let a proficient character “just know” what forms to file or which officials to call, reserving
        rolls for moments when disasters loom or when they push against policy.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Harbor Operations</strong><br />
        A storm front closes in on a coastal city while the docks are packed. The GM frames a 6‑segment “Clear the
        Harbor” Clock. A PC with Harbor Operations and Systems &amp; Diagnostics takes charge. Instead of rolling
        at DC 18, their Proficiency reduces the task to DC 14 and grants Edge on a PRE + Systems &amp;
        Diagnostics Check as they issue orders and adjust schedules. On a Full Success, two segments of the Clock
        fill and ships pull away cleanly. On a Partial, the Clock advances but one overloaded vessel is forced to
        remain, creating a new problem when the storm hits.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-caravan-logistics">Caravan Logistics — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Caravan Logistics covers the art of moving people and goods over long
        distances by road, rail, or trail. It combines route planning, supply forecasting, and an understanding of
        weather, terrain, and border requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Choosing routes, calculating rations, planning rest stops, and
        budgeting for tolls or bribes. In play, this Proficiency influences decisions about when to push on, when
        to detour, and how to respond when the unexpected happens—washed‑out bridges, closed passes, or rumors of
        bandits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Routine travel planning inside known territory is automatic; the GM
        simply describes a competent plan. When journeys become risky, Caravan Logistics can lower DCs on MIG + Grit
        &amp; Endurance or RSN + Wayfinding Checks, or allow the group to attempt maneuvers others could not, such
        as rerouting an overloaded caravan through marginal paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Caravans are social spaces filled with traders, guards, and
        travelers. This Proficiency gives the GM reasons to introduce side contracts, tensions over resources, or
        conflicting route advice, all of which you are well placed to mediate—or exploit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> When a character with Caravan Logistics is present, front‑load their
        questions and recommendations. On Partial Successes, let the journey continue but with new Tags—<em>Low on
        Water</em>, <em>Fraying Tempers</em>, or <em>Suppressed Mutiny</em>—instead of simple delays.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Caravan Logistics</strong><br />
        The group must move refugees across an arid plateau. The GM sets a “Reach the Oasis” Clock and notes Tags
        like <em>Scorching Heat</em> and <em>Limited Wells</em>. With Caravan Logistics, a PC makes an RSN +
        Wayfinding Check at DC 15 instead of DC 18. A Full Success advances the Clock and avoids additional
        Conditions. A Partial advances the Clock but adds <em>Exhausted</em> to several refugees, seeding future
        medical and moral decisions.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-station-traffic-control">Station Traffic Control — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Station Traffic Control reflects training in managing crowded transit nodes:
        relay stations, orbital docks, subway interchanges, or similar hubs. You understand signal systems, safety
        protocols, and how small delays propagate into larger crises.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Coordinating arrivals and departures, rerouting vehicles during
        emergencies, prioritizing medical or security craft, and reading traffic patterns for signs of unusual
        activity. In play, this Proficiency often appears in tense sequences where timing matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Routine scheduling rarely calls for a roll. Under pressure, Station
        Traffic Control can provide Edge on PRE or RSN Checks involving large‑scale movement, and may allow
        the group to treat some Failures as Partial Successes when responding quickly averts the worst outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Traffic controllers are plugged into both official channels and
        back‑channel chatter. Their position makes it easy to notice suspicious patterns—but also easy to erase
        evidence or cover for smugglers. The GM can use this to tie the Proficiency into faction play and fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> When this Proficiency is in play, zoom out to show how entire districts or
        sectors respond. Use Clocks to represent congestion or escalating danger, and let successful Checks tick
        multiple segments when plans are well executed.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Station Traffic Control</strong><br />
        A sabotage attempt targets a relay station during peak shift. The GM introduces a “Cascade Failure” Clock
        and several Tags: <em>Crowded</em>, <em>Noisy</em>, <em>Alert Security</em>. A PC with Station Traffic
        Control uses RSN + Systems &amp; Diagnostics to re‑route trains and isolate damaged lines at DC 16 with
        Edge. On a Full Success, they tick the Clock back and stabilize traffic. On a Partial, they prevent a
        catastrophic collision but leave parts of the network shut down, creating political fallout in later
        scenes.
      </div>

      <h3 id="proficiencies-lore-research">Lore &amp; Research Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Lore and research Proficiencies describe how your character interacts with records, stories, and hidden

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4 id="prof-historical-archives">Historical Archives — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Historical Archives reflects experience with official records and how they are
        kept, altered, and lost. You know how registries are organized, which offices misfile frequently, and how
        to track paper (or digital) trails across bureaucracies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Land deeds, census records, guild rosters, shipping manifests, and
        legal proceedings. In play, this Proficiency supports investigations into who owns what, who was present
        where, and how institutions have changed claims over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Routine archive searches for straightforward information are automatic.
        For more complex tasks—like reconstructing a partially destroyed registry—Historical Archives lowers DCs
        on RSN + Investigation or RSN + Lore &amp; Analysis Checks and may reduce the time required to sift
        through material.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Archives reveal both truth and bias. The GM can use this
        Proficiency to highlight gaps, redactions, and contradictions, turning the act of research into a scene
        with stakes rather than a simple information drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> On Partial Success, consider providing accurate but incomplete data: the
        PCs learn enough to act, but not enough to avoid unintended consequences, which can drive future sessions.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Historical Archives</strong><br />
        Searching for the origins of a disputed estate, a PC consults city ledgers. The GM calls for an RSN +
        Lore &amp; Analysis Check at DC 14, eased by Historical Archives. On a Full Success, they find an old map
        and cross‑reference showing the estate’s boundaries shrinking over time, pointing toward quiet encroachment
        by a neighbor. On a Partial, they recover only a subset of records, implicating the neighbor but leaving
        room for plausible deniability.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-occult-librarianship">Occult Librarianship — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Occult Librarianship covers the care, cataloging, and cautious study of
        dangerous or esoteric texts. You understand containment procedures, warning signs, and the subtle ways
        knowledge can warp those who engage with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Interpreting marginalia in ritual manuals, identifying missing pages
        from a grim compendium, or recognizing when a “harmless” folk charm echoes a much older, riskier practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> With this Proficiency, the GM will usually share more and safer context
        from strange texts without requiring a Check. When rolls are needed—often RSN + Lore &amp; Analysis or RSN
        + Investigation—Occult Librarianship can justify Edge or reduce DCs, particularly when evaluating
        whether a ritual is incomplete or corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> This Proficiency naturally introduces fronts tied to forbidden
        research, missing tomes, or institutions that hide what they know “for the greater good.” It also tempts
        PCs to push beyond safe limits in pursuit of answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use Occult Librarianship to let players opt into horror or mystery at
        their own pace. On Partial Success, reveal enough to be useful but hint at deeper, more dangerous layers
        that require future scenes to explore.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Occult Librarianship</strong><br />
        A PC examines a ritual folio tied to recent disappearances. The GM calls for an RSN + Lore &amp; Analysis
        Check at DC 16 with Edge due to Occult Librarianship. A Full Success reveals that the ritual is
        missing a crucial protective stanza, explaining why the victims were unmade rather than transported. A
        Partial identifies the ritual’s purpose but not its flaw, inviting the PCs to consider attempting it
        themselves at great risk.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-cold-case-records">Cold‑Case Records — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Cold‑Case Records reflects long practice in maintaining and revisiting old,
        unresolved investigations. You know how evidence degrades, how witness stories shift, and how institutional
        priorities bury or revive cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Re‑opening archived case files, comparing patterns of unsolved crimes,
        and tracing the careers of investigators who worked them. In play, this Proficiency helps you connect
        present events to older incidents others thought unrelated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> With Cold‑Case Records, the GM will often allow you to spot patterns
        without a roll when time is not an issue. When pressure mounts—limited access windows, political oversight,
        or active threats—this Proficiency improves RSN + Investigation Checks and may let you treat some Failures
        as Partial Successes that reveal leads but also awaken old enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Digging into cold cases can unsettle powerful factions and reopen
        wounds in communities. The GM can use this Proficiency to tie new mysteries into older tragedies, building
        a sense of continuity across arcs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> On Partial Success, you might advance a “Truth Revealed” Clock while also
        ticking a “Past Comes Due” or “Retaliation” Clock, showing that progress has a cost.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Cold‑Case Records</strong><br />
        The PCs suspect a recent arson is tied to decades‑old factory fires. The GM calls for an RSN + Investigation
        Check at DC 15, with Cold‑Case Records granting Edge. A Full Success uncovers a pattern of suppressed
        reports implicating the same family of contractors. A Partial connects the new fire to the old pattern but
        also surfaces that the original investigator disappeared after filing their last report, adding a new layer
        of danger.

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4 id="prof-field-medicine">Field Medicine — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Field Medicine represents practical training in keeping people alive when
        resources are scarce and conditions are bad. You know how to improvise gear, recognize life‑threatening
        signs quickly, and decide when “good enough” is better than “perfect.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Battlefield triage, disaster relief, frontier clinics, and any scene
        where the nearest proper facility is hours away. In play, this Proficiency often pairs with Skills like
        Field Medicine (Skill) or Grit &amp; Endurance to stabilize allies while under threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Routine first aid in safe contexts requires no roll. Under pressure,
        Field Medicine can reduce DCs on MIG or RSN Checks to treat Conditions like <em>Bleeding</em> or
        <em>Poisoned</em>, or justify Edge when you have minimal equipment but ample experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> This Proficiency invites the GM to present hard choices: which
        patient to treat first, what resources to expend now versus later, and how to balance the physical and
        emotional toll on caregivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> On Partial Success, let the PC stabilize a patient at a cost—perhaps the
        treatment introduces a new Condition like <em>Scarred</em> or ticks a Clock tracking supplies or morale.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Field Medicine</strong><br />
        After an ambush on a mountain road, several allies are down. The GM sets a “Stabilize the Wounded” Clock
        and notes Tags like <em>Hazardous</em> (falling rocks) and <em>Limited Supplies</em>. A PC with Field
        Medicine makes a MIG + Field Medicine Skill Check at DC 15 with Edge. A Full Success both stabilizes
        the worst injury and advances the Clock significantly. A Partial stabilizes the ally but depletes bandages
        and drugs, adding a “Supply Shortage” Clock for the next leg of the journey.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-clinical-practice">Clinical Practice — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Clinical Practice reflects formal experience in organized medical settings:
        wards, clinics, research hospitals, or temple infirmaries. You know procedures, hierarchies, and how to
        coordinate multi‑step care.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Diagnosing complex conditions, overseeing surgeries, managing
        long‑term treatment plans, and navigating paperwork and ethics boards. In play, this Proficiency often
        opens doors within institutions and lends authority when arguing for care.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Clinical Practice may remove the need to roll for routine care in
        well‑equipped settings. When Checks are necessary—such as rushing experimental treatment or pushing a
        facility past safe capacity—this Proficiency can grant Edge on RSN + Medicine or PRE + Command
        Checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Institutional medicine is entangled with politics, funding, and
        social inequality. The GM can use this Proficiency to foreground conflicts over who receives care, who
        pays, and who decides.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> On Partial Success, let the medical outcome succeed but introduce
        institutional consequences: a reprimand, an audit, or a patient’s family owing a significant favor.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Clinical Practice</strong><br />
        A PC attempts to secure an isolated ward for a contagious patient. The GM calls for a PRE + Command &amp;
        Coordination Check at DC 16, with Clinical Practice granting Edge. A Full Success gets the ward and
        staff they need. A Partial success grants the ward but flags their actions to hospital leadership, adding
        a “Administrative Scrutiny” Clock.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-trauma-response">Trauma Response — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Trauma Response focuses on managing emergencies where medical, logistical,
        and psychological pressures collide. You know how to establish triage, communicate clearly, and keep
        people moving in the face of chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Mass‑casualty events, fires, structural collapses, and other crises
        that overwhelm normal systems. In play, this Proficiency allows PCs to coordinate both care and crowd
        control under extreme stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Trauma Response can reduce DCs or grant Edge on PRE + Command &
        Coordination, MIG + Grit &amp; Endurance, or RSN + Systems &amp; Diagnostics Checks tied to emergency
        management. It also justifies treating some Failures as Partial Successes where lives are saved but at the
        cost of resources, structural damage, or new Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Characters with this Proficiency see the worst moments in a
        community. The GM can use it to spotlight resilience, burnout, and public trust—or lack thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> When resolving large‑scale crises, pair this Proficiency with Clocks
        that represent both harm and response. Successful Checks should visibly bend the trajectory of disaster.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Trauma Response</strong><br />
        During a station fire, a PC with Trauma Response organizes evacuees. The GM establishes parallel Clocks:
        “Fire Spreads” and “Evacuation Complete.” A PRE + Command &amp; Coordination Check at DC 17 benefits from
        Trauma Response. On a Full Success, “Evacuation Complete” advances rapidly while “Fire Spreads” stalls.
        On a Partial, both Clocks advance, saving many but leaving parts of the station damaged and some people
        unaccounted for.
      </div>

      <h3 id="proficiencies-community-institutions">Community &amp; Institutions Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Community and institutions Proficiencies describe how characters navigate social structures, from informal

      <h4 id="prof-community-organizing">Community Organizing — Role Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Community Organizing reflects experience rallying neighbors, coworkers, or
        citizens around shared issues. You know who is trusted, what concerns resonate, and how to turn frustration
        into constructive action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Planning meetings, coordinating petitions, building coalitions across
        groups, and keeping momentum going between crises. In play, this Proficiency shapes how quickly and
        effectively communities respond to threats and opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Community Organizing often allows PRE + Persuasion &amp; Appeal or PRE +
        Command &amp; Coordination Checks to operate at lower DCs when you advocate for local needs, or grants
        Edge when the cause clearly aligns with community interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Organized communities can change the course of campaigns—but
        organizing also paints targets on visible leaders. The GM can use this Proficiency to bring fronts focused
        on repression, co‑optation, or hard‑won victories into focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> On Partial Success, allow community movements to grow but introduce
        complications: internal disagreements, counter‑campaigns, or increased scrutiny from authorities.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Community Organizing</strong><br />
        A factory district faces unsafe conditions. A PC with Community Organizing calls a meeting at a local hall.
        The GM calls for a PRE + Persuasion &amp; Appeal Check at DC 14 instead of 16, recognizing the Proficiency.
        On a Full Success, workers form a unified committee and adopt a shared list of demands. On a Partial, they
        agree to act but split into factions over tactics, giving the GM rich material for future sessions.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-court-etiquette">Court Etiquette — Role Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Court Etiquette captures knowledge of formal protocol, titles, and ritualized
        behavior in elite spaces—royal courts, corporate boardrooms, high temples, or similar halls of power.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Knowing how to address officials properly, when to speak or remain
        silent, which gifts are appropriate, and how to interpret seating arrangements or guest lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Court Etiquette can remove the need for rolls to avoid faux pas in
        formal settings. When Checks are required—such as persuading a council or reading the mood of a court—this
        Proficiency can lower DCs or grant Edge on PRE + Insight &amp; Empathy or PRE + Persuasion &amp;
        Appeal Checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Courts and councils are rich with intrigue. The GM can use this
        Proficiency to expose hidden alliances, rivalries, and expectations, while also making the PC a known
        player in political games.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> On Partial Success, let PCs achieve their formal goals while entangling
        them socially—unexpected obligations, whispered rumors, or jealous rivals appear as a result of their
        presence.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Court Etiquette</strong><br />
        Seeking support from a royal council, a PC presents a petition. Court Etiquette lets them bypass rolls to
        gain entry and avoid simple missteps. The GM then calls for a PRE + Persuasion &amp; Appeal Check at DC 16
        with Edge. A Full Success wins backing with favorable terms. A Partial secures support but binds the
        group to host a high‑profile event that will later draw unwelcome attention.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-neighborhood-fixer">Neighborhood Fixer — Role Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Neighborhood Fixer represents being the person people go to when they do not
        know where else to turn. You know who owes what to whom, which shortcuts exist, and how to arrange small
        miracles on short notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Finding safe housing for someone in trouble, locating a discreet
        mechanic, or arranging a meeting between rivals. In play, this Proficiency often acts as a bridge between
        the PCs and the setting’s web of minor NPCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Neighborhood Fixer allows PCs to call in favors or identify useful
        contacts without rolls for low‑stakes matters. When stakes rise, this Proficiency can lower DCs on PRE +
        Streetwise or PRE + Deception &amp; Performance Checks, or allow them to attempt delicate arrangements
        others could not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Being a fixer means being in the middle. The GM can complicate
        things by having multiple parties ask for incompatible help, or by making success in one favor create
        obligations to another faction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use this Proficiency to keep the story moving when players are stuck, but
        balance it with favors owed. On Partial Success, let the PC secure what they want, but attach clear strings
        or time limits.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Neighborhood Fixer</strong><br />
        The group needs a quiet space to meet a whistleblower. A PC with Neighborhood Fixer knows a café owner who
        closes early. The GM lets them secure the space without a roll but calls for a PRE + Streetwise Check at
        DC 13 to ensure no one follows them there. On a Full Success, the meeting is private and uneventful. On a
        Partial, the meeting happens, but a curious local notices the unusual gathering and spreads rumors, adding
        a “Neighborhood Gossip” Clock.
      </div>

      <h3 id="proficiencies-security-covert">Security &amp; Covert Operations Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Security and covert operations Proficiencies describe how characters interact with threats, surveillance,
        and the hidden movements of people and information. They determine who sees danger first, who can move
        unseen, and how institutions respond when lines are crossed.

      <h4 id="prof-perimeter-security">Perimeter Security — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Perimeter Security reflects experience in setting up and reading physical
        defenses: fences, checkpoints, sensor grids, and patrol routes. You know what real protection looks like
        versus staged security meant only to deter casual intruders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Designing patrol patterns, placing alarms, evaluating access points,
        and exploiting weaknesses in existing setups. In play, this Proficiency can help you fortify a safehouse,
        quietly bypass a facility’s blind spot, or recognize when an enemy has deliberately left a gap as bait.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Routine assessments of basic perimeters require no roll. Under pressure,
        Perimeter Security can lower DCs or grant Edge on RSN + Investigation, RSN + Perception &amp;
        Awareness, or AGI + Stealth &amp; Evasion Checks related to security layouts and blind spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> This Proficiency naturally ties into Clocks representing
        escalating alerts or probing attacks. It also makes you a person of interest to both those who build
        security systems and those who wish to break them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use Perimeter Security to keep infiltration scenes sharp but fair: a PC
        with this Proficiency should rarely be surprised by obvious defenses, but subtle or intentionally misleading
        setups can still create tense moments.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Perimeter Security</strong><br />
        The PCs must slip into a relay control yard. The GM describes fences, towers, and patrols, then calls for an
        RSN + Perception &amp; Awareness Check at DC 15, modified by Perimeter Security. On a Full Success, the PC
        identifies a blind spot between cameras and patrol arcs, granting Edge to the next AGI + Stealth &amp;
        Evasion Check for the group. On a Partial, they find a workable route but misjudge timing, ticking a “Guards
        Suspicious” Clock as a light briefly sweeps across their path.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-criminal-underworld">Criminal Underworld — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Criminal Underworld represents familiarity with illicit networks, black‑market
        channels, and the social rules that keep them running. You know who handles which trades, how word travels,
        and what lines even criminals hesitate to cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Sourcing contraband, arranging discreet transportation, finding
        off‑the‑books muscle, and reading the reputations of crews and bosses. In play, this Proficiency often
        determines how much trouble comes attached to the favors you ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> Simple underworld contacts or purchases may be handled without rolls,
        especially in familiar territory. When tension is high—crossing syndicates, dealing with informants, or
        trying to operate quietly in hostile turf—Criminal Underworld can lower DCs or grant Edge on PRE +
        Streetwise, PRE + Deception &amp; Performance, or PRE + Persuasion &amp; Appeal Checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Underworld ties cut both ways. The GM can use this Proficiency to
        surface hooks like outstanding debts, rival enforcers, or opportunities to play factions against each
        other, as well as to show the consequences when things go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> On Partial Success, take care to show both the benefit and the cost:
        information arrives but so does a rival; a purchase goes through but the goods are tagged or flawed.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Criminal Underworld</strong><br />
        The PCs want unregistered weapons before a risky job. A PC with Criminal Underworld knows which alley
        warehouse to visit. The GM calls for a PRE + Streetwise Check at DC 14 with Edge. On a Full Success,
        they secure the gear quietly. On a Partial, they get what they want, but the supplier quietly informs a
        local boss that “something big is coming,” ticking a “Gang Interest” Clock.
      </div>

      <h4 id="prof-espionage-tradecraft">Espionage Tradecraft — Domain Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Espionage Tradecraft covers the techniques of spying and counter‑spying:
        surveillance detection, coded communication, infiltration planning, and the habits that keep agents alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope and examples:</strong> Establishing dead drops, creating and maintaining cover identities,
        detecting when conversations are being recorded, and planning entry and exit routes that leave few traces.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default benefits:</strong> With this Proficiency, the GM may simply tell you when obvious
        surveillance is present or when your own operational security is clearly compromised. When a Check is
        appropriate—often AGI + Stealth &amp; Evasion, PRE + Deception &amp; Performance, or RSN + Investigation—
        Espionage Tradecraft can lower DCs or grant Edge, especially when the PC has had time to prepare.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunities and risks:</strong> Tradecraft invites layered plots. The GM can use this Proficiency
        to build cat‑and‑mouse games where both PCs and NPCs are constantly testing each other’s preparations and
        assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> When resolving espionage scenes, think in terms of Clocks that track who
        has the advantage. On Partial Success, let the PC achieve their immediate goal but advance a Clock that
        represents an unseen opponent closing in.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Espionage Tradecraft</strong><br />
        A PC must meet a contact in a café without revealing their interest to a watching faction. The GM sets a
        “Surveillance Tightens” Clock and calls for a PRE + Deception &amp; Performance Check at DC 16, modified
        by Espionage Tradecraft. On a Full Success, the conversation happens naturally and the Clock does not
        advance. On a Partial, the meeting succeeds but the Clock ticks, representing a shadowy observer noting
        their pattern for future use.

    <section id="ch-18-extended-tags-conditions-reference">
      <h2>18. Extended Tags and Conditions Reference</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter expands the overview from Chapter 9 into a deeper reference. It gathers common Tags and
        Conditions into categories, explains how to use them across genres, and offers guidance for creating new
        entries. You do not need to memorize every detail. Instead, treat this chapter as a toolbox you can glance
        at when you want inspiration or clarity about how a particular descriptor might work in play.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tags-overview-extended">Tags in Depth</h3>
      <p>
        Tags are short descriptors applied to scenes, locations, objects, or situations. They are reminders that
        certain details should matter whenever characters act in that context. A Tag rarely changes the core
        procedure of a Check; instead, it adjusts how hard an action is, how risky it feels, or how effective it
        can be. Tags are one of your main tools for making the fiction mechanically meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this system, Tags most often:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grant Edge or Burden on specific Checks.</li>
        <li>Shift DCs up or down along the standard ladder (Easy 12 to Legendary 22).</li>
        <li>Change risk and impact—how exposed you are if something goes wrong, or how much impact success has.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A good Tag has three qualities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear fiction:</strong> The table can easily picture what the Tag means.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical teeth:</strong> It obviously helps some actions and hinders others.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited scope:</strong> It does not try to describe everything about a scene—only a few key aspects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="environmental-tags">Environmental Tags</h3>
      <p>
        Environmental Tags describe physical space: light, footing, cover, elevation, and other features that shape
        movement and line of sight. They are often present before characters arrive and may persist across multiple
        scenes until something in the fiction changes them.

        Situational Tags describe pressures and circumstances that may change rapidly as scenes unfold. Atmospheric
        Tags describe the emotional or social tone of a moment. Both help you highlight what matters right now in

        <strong>Example – Combining Tags in a Scene</strong><br />
        A street protest has the Tags <em>Crowded</em>, <em>Tense</em>, and <em>Surveillance</em>. A PC trying to
        slip through without notice may gain Edge on AGI + Stealth &amp; Evasion thanks to <em>Crowded</em>,
        but attempts to stage a covert meeting in the middle of the rally risk advancing a “Authorities Respond”
        Clock because of <em>Surveillance</em>. PRE‑based attempts to calm a brewing clash face higher DCs under
        <em>Tense</em>, while a carefully framed speech might clear that Tag if it succeeds.
      </div>

      <h3 id="tags-creating-your-own">Creating Your Own Tags</h3>
      <p>
        You are encouraged to invent Tags that fit your campaign. When doing so, keep the following questions in
        mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What detail in the fiction am I trying to highlight?</li>
        <li>Which actions should become easier, and which should become riskier?</li>
        <li>Does this Tag suggest interesting complications on Partial Success or Failure?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you name a Tag, quickly agree at the table how it behaves. If you find that a Tag is not pulling its
        weight—no one remembers it or it never affects decisions—either retire it or sharpen its effects so that
        it matters.

        Conditions are persistent states attached to characters. They represent injuries, emotions, afflictions, or
        temporary edges that follow you across scenes until cleared. Where Tags describe the world around you,
        Conditions describe what you are carrying with you—physically, mentally, or socially.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Conditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Impose Burden on specific categories of Checks.</li>
        <li>Limit safe options (“you can’t sprint on that leg,” “you can’t act this turn”).</li>
        <li>Threaten escalation if ignored, often via Clocks or worsening states.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This chapter groups common Conditions by type and offers guidance for introducing and clearing them in a
        way that supports character stories rather than shutting them down.
      </p>

      <h3 id="physical-conditions">Physical Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Physical Conditions represent injuries, exhaustion, or bodily harm. They are often the result of combat,
        hazards, overexertion, or environmental exposure.
      </p>

      <h3 id="mental-social-conditions">Mental and Social Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Mental and social Conditions reflect fear, distraction, obsession, or shifts in reputation and trust. They
        show how events leave marks on characters’ thoughts and relationships, not just their bodies.
      </p>

      </table>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Layered Conditions</strong><br />
        After a disastrous negotiation and a physical escape, a PC ends up both <em>Exhausted</em> and
        <em>Compromised Reputation</em> with a local guild. Their attempts to fix the situation may require RSN +
        Lore &amp; Analysis or PRE + Persuasion &amp; Appeal Checks at higher DCs, while physical stunts are risky
        until they rest. As they address each Condition in play—resting, apologizing, making amends—those
        Conditions clear, marking character change.
      </div>

      <h3 id="conditions-severity-progression">Severity and Progression</h3>
      <p>
        Some Conditions are best treated as points along a progression rather than isolated states. For example, an
        injury might start as <em>Bruised</em>, escalate to <em>Wounded</em>, and culminate in a more serious
        Condition if repeatedly ignored. You do not need a rigid track for every case, but thinking in terms of
        “light, moderate, severe” consequences can help you calibrate how hard recovery should be.
      </p>
      <p>
        When upgrading or downgrading Conditions, announce what is happening in the fiction first—then adjust the
        label to match. This keeps Conditions tied to story beats instead of feeling like abstract status effects.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tags-conditions-clocks-together">Tags, Conditions, and Clocks Together</h3>
      <p>
        Tags, Conditions, and Clocks become most powerful when used together. Tags set the stage; Conditions mark
        what has happened to the characters; Clocks track how close you are to change. Many worked examples in
        earlier chapters already combine them. This section adds a few patterns you can reuse.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Environment → Condition:</strong> A <em>Hazardous</em> Tag makes certain Failures inflict <em>Bleeding</em>, <em>Poisoned</em>, or <em>Frightened</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Condition → Clock:</strong> A serious injury creates a “Recover From Wound” Clock instead of clearing after a single scene.</li>
        <li><strong>Clock → Tag:</strong> As a threat Clock fills, it may add new Tags—<em>Smoke‑Filled</em>, <em>Panic Rising</em>, <em>Martial Law</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Hazard, Condition, and Clock</strong><br />
        The group explores a collapsing mine tagged <em>Hazardous</em> and <em>Unstable</em>. Early on, a Failure on
        a MIG + Athletic Movement Check inflicts <em>Bleeding</em> on one PC and ticks a “Tunnel Collapse” Clock.
        Later, as the Clock fills, the GM adds a new Tag—<em>Dust‑Choked</em>—which makes RSN + Perception &amp;
        Awareness Checks harder and threatens <em>Exhausted</em> if characters linger. By the time they escape, the
        mine’s Tags and their Conditions tell the story of what it cost to get out.
      </div>

      <h3 id="designing-new-conditions">Designing New Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        When you invent a new Condition, follow the same pattern as Tags:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name what has changed for the character in the fiction.</li>
        <li>Specify which kinds of Checks it helps or hinders (if any).</li>
        <li>Decide how it escalates if ignored and how it can be cleared.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Conditions do not need intricate, numeric rules to matter. If everyone understands what <em>Haunted</em>,
        <em>Homesick</em>, or <em>On Thin Ice With the Guild</em> means, the table can apply Burden, DC
        shifts, or narrative constraints consistently as situations arise.
      </p>

      <h3 id="beneficial-conditions">Beneficial Conditions and Edges</h3>
      <p>
        Not all Conditions are penalties. Some represent moments of insight, protection, or support that tilt the
        odds in your favor. These “edge” Conditions work like other Conditions—they are named, they have clear
        triggers and clearing conditions—but they grant advantages when the fiction supports them.
      </p>

      <table>
        <caption>Beneficial Conditions</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Condition</th>
            <th>What It Represents</th>
            <th>Typical Effects &amp; Clearing</th>

        <tbody>
          <tr>

            <td>A burst of confidence or insight grounded in recent events.</td>
            <td>Edge on one or a few Checks tied to the source of inspiration (a speech, a victory, a vow); clears once that benefit is used or the scene ends.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Sheltered</strong></td>
            <td>Taking cover under protection—physical, social, or institutional.</td>
            <td>Reduced effect or Burden on attacks against you from certain angles or factions; clears when you leave protection or it is withdrawn.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Bolstered</strong></td>
            <td>Reassurance, magical warding, or careful preparation.</td>
            <td>Edge on Checks to resist a specific danger (fear, charm, fire, interrogation); often tied to a short Clock or a single scene.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Focused</strong></td>
            <td>Calm, centered attention on a task or goal.</td>
            <td>Edge on RSN‑heavy or precision actions related to the focus; may impose Burden on unrelated impulsive choices; clears when you are interrupted or choose to break focus.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Backed by Authority</strong></td>
            <td>Acting with formal sanction, warrants, or clear mandate.</td>
            <td>Lower DCs or Edge on social Checks with people who respect that authority; higher DCs when dealing with those who resent or fear it. Clears when the mandate expires or is revoked.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        You can add beneficial Conditions when characters earn them through play—completing preparation, forging
        alliances, or achieving symbolic victories. They are a good way to reward smart choices without rewriting
        core mechanics and to show how earlier scenes echo forward into new challenges.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tags-conditions-genre-packs">Genre Tag &amp; Condition Packs</h3>
      <p>
        Different genres emphasize different Tags and Conditions. You do not need separate rules for each genre,
        but it can be helpful to think in terms of “packs” you are likely to reuse. The lists below are starting
        points—add, remove, or rename entries to fit your specific setting.

        You can sketch a quick genre pack at session zero and keep it nearby as a menu. When framing scenes, glance
        at the pack and ask which Tags and Conditions feel appropriate. Over time, you will discover recurring
        combinations that help your table recognize the feel of your campaign at a glance.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tags-conditions-quick-procedure">At the Table: Quick Procedure</h3>
      <p>
        When you are in the middle of play and do not want to stop for long lists, use this short procedure:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Describe first.</strong> Paint the scene in plain language—what feels unstable, crowded, eerie, or hopeful.</li>
        <li><strong>Name 1–3 Tags.</strong> Turn the most important details into Tags that will matter for Checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and resolve.</strong> Apply Tags and existing Conditions as Edge/Burden, DC shifts, or changes to consequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Update states.</strong> If the outcome is significant, add or clear Conditions or adjust Clocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Move on.</strong> Do not retag everything every round; only update when the fiction clearly changes.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you are ever unsure which mechanical tweak to use, start with Edge/Burden. Only reach for DC
        shifts or new Clocks when you want to signal larger changes in risk or pacing.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Use Conditions to Spotlight Characters</strong><br />
        Conditions are most satisfying when they create interesting choices instead of simple penalties. Offer ways
        for players to lean into their Conditions for advantage (accepting short‑term risk or cost) and ways to
        clear them through scenes that matter to their arcs—conversations, confessions, training, or moments of
        rest that reveal something new.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-19-advancement-long-term-growth">
      <h2 id="advancement-long-term-growth-heading">19. Advancement and Long Term Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Characters in this game are meant to change. Advancement is how you show that change on the sheet. Over
        time, characters deepen their existing strengths, grow in new directions, shift relationships, and leave
        marks on the world. This chapter explains how advancement works mechanically, how to pace it, and how to
        use long‑term growth to reinforce the stories you want to tell.
      </p>

      <h3 id="advancement-philosophy">Advancement Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        Advancement is not just power escalation. It is about <strong>commitment and consequence</strong>. When a
        character advances, you are answering questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What have they practiced enough that it now comes easily?</li>
        <li>Which relationships or responsibilities have deepened into Proficiencies?</li>
        <li>Where has the world left marks that will not simply fade away?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The system assumes a steady but flexible pace. Groups that play short campaigns can focus on a few big
        milestones. Long‑running tables can layer many smaller adjustments over time. In both cases, advancement
        should feel earned and should point toward new decisions, not just add flat bonuses.
      </p>

      <h3 id="advancement-triggers">When Advancement Happens</h3>
      <p>
        There are three main advancement triggers. You can use one of them as your default, or blend them as fits
        your table:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Session‑Based Advancement:</strong> Every few sessions (for example, every 3–4), the group
          reviews what has changed and grants a small advancement. This is simple to track and works well for
          episodic play.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Milestone Advancement:</strong> Advancement occurs when characters resolve significant goals:
          completing an arc, changing a faction’s status, overcoming a major front, or achieving a personal
          breakthrough.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Downtime Advancement:</strong> Certain Downtime activities (Chapter 12) explicitly unlock
          new options—study, training, research, or community work that, when completed, grant advancements.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You do not need a separate experience point currency unless your table enjoys tracking it. For most
        campaigns, a combination of session review and clear milestones is enough to keep growth steady and
        meaningful.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Pace, Not Payment</strong><br />
        Think of advancement as pacing, not as a reward to withhold or grant as punishment. If your group is
        engaged, taking risks, and pushing the story forward, advancement should follow. Use it to signal
        chapters in the campaign, not to score performance.
      </div>

      <h3 id="advancement-menu">Advancement Menu</h3>
      <p>
        When an advancement trigger occurs, each character chooses one option from the menu below (or a smaller
        subset agreed upon for the current arc). You can mix and match over time—one advancement might improve an
        Attribute, another might add a Skill, another might unlock a new Proficiency.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attribute Growth:</strong> Raise one Attribute by +1 (up to the table’s agreed cap).</li>
        <li><strong>New Skill:</strong> Add a new Skill that fits recent experiences or campaign needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill Deepening:</strong> Sharpen an existing Skill by broadening its examples and fictional reach.</li>
        <li><strong>New Proficiency:</strong> Gain a new Proficiency that reflects training, role change, or earned authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Proficiency Deepening:</strong> Expand the scope or impact of a Proficiency you already have.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship &amp; Reputation:</strong> Formalize a new bond, contact, or standing as a trackable element.</li>
        <li><strong>Tag / Condition Edge:</strong> Establish a recurring beneficial Condition or signature Tag you can invoke.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also define campaign‑specific options—unlocking access to certain playbooks, factions, or gear
        packages once certain arcs complete. Keep the menu small at first and grow it as your table discovers what
        feels fun.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attribute-advancement">Attribute Advancement</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) measure broad tendencies. Increasing an Attribute means you have changed in
        a visible way: stronger, quicker, more confident, or more insightful. Attribute growth is <strong>slow and
        rare</strong> compared to Skill or Proficiency changes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>By default, a character might gain +1 to an Attribute only a few times in an entire campaign.</li>
        <li>Attribute increases should be tied to major milestones—training arcs, transformational events, or long‑term practice.</li>
        <li>Consider setting a soft cap (for example, “most characters will not exceed +3 in an Attribute without special circumstances”).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you raise an Attribute, revisit examples in Chapter 7. How does a character with this new rating
        behave differently? Let the fiction catch up: show new capabilities, confidence, or habits before you lean
        on the bonus mechanically.
      </p>

      <h3 id="skill-advancement">Skill Advancement</h3>
      <p>
        Skills represent practiced competencies. They will change more often than Attributes. When a character
        consistently uses a particular approach, or spends Downtime deliberately training, it is natural that new
        Skills appear or existing ones deepen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical Skill advancements include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adding a new Skill</strong> that fits recent events (learning Forensics after a long investigation arc).</li>
        <li><strong>Refining an existing Skill</strong> by expanding its examples or categories (Tinkering now clearly covers specific devices or domains).</li>
        <li><strong>Linking Skills to new Attributes</strong> as the character learns alternate approaches (using Streetwise with RSN after a period of careful study, not just PRE improvisation).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Advancement does not need to be numeric to matter. Sometimes, the best Skill advancement is updating its
        description in your notes to match what the character has actually done—then letting that broader scope
        justify Edge or new fictional permissions in future scenes.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Skill Advancement Through Play</strong><br />
        Over several arcs, a PC repeatedly uses Systems &amp; Diagnostics not just on machines but on social
        systems—modeling faction responses and predicting policy fallout. When an advancement trigger hits, the
        table agrees that this Skill now explicitly covers “social modeling” as part of its description. Future
        Checks in that niche may receive Edge or lower DCs, reflecting that lived experience.
      </div>

      <h3 id="proficiency-advancement">Proficiency Advancement</h3>
      <p>
        Proficiencies (Chapter 16 and 17) represent domain expertise and narrative permission. They are a natural
        place to focus long‑term growth. Advancing a Proficiency usually means one of two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Broadening scope:</strong> Your expertise applies in more places or to more situations.</li>
        <li><strong>Deepening impact:</strong> Within its existing scope, your Proficiency changes the fiction more strongly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Harbor Operations broadens from one city to the entire coastal region.</li>
        <li>Community Organizing deepens so that movements you start are harder to suppress and better at resisting backlash.</li>
        <li>Cold‑Case Records broadens to cover not just police archives but independent and underground records.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When a Proficiency advances, talk through concrete fictional changes first—new contacts, credentials, or
        responsibilities—then decide how often it will justify Edge, reduced DCs, or automatic success for
        routine tasks in its expanded area.
      </p>

      <h3 id="milestones-and-growth">Milestones, Arcs, and Growth</h3>
      <p>
        Milestones are story beats where something about the world or the characters is clearly different than
        before. Use them as anchors for advancement decisions. Ask, at the end of an arc:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What did we learn or change?</li>
        <li>Which abilities were central to this arc?</li>
        <li>Which relationships or responsibilities feel different now?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Advancement choices should follow those answers. If an arc centered on a labor dispute, Proficiencies like
        Union Stewardship or Community Organizing are natural candidates for growth. If an arc focused on strange
        artifacts, Lore &amp; Analysis or Occult Librarianship might advance.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Milestone Advancement</strong><br />
        After resolving a long‑running conflict between harbor workers and a shipping consortium, the group reaches
        a milestone. One PC chooses to broaden their Community Organizing Proficiency to explicitly cover “Port‑Wide
        Coalition Building.” Another adds a new Skill, Negotiation Structures, based on months of haggling. A third,
        who spent much of the arc hauling crates and repairing docks, takes a +1 to MIG, reflecting a more physically
        demanding life.
      </div>

      <h3 id="downtime-and-advancement">Downtime and Advancement</h3>
      <p>
        Downtime (Chapter 12) is an ideal place to handle training, research, and recovery. You can tie specific
        Downtime projects to future advancements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A training project might, when completed, unlock a new Skill or Attribute increase.</li>
        <li>A research project might create or broaden a Proficiency (for example, Arcane Cartography).</li>
        <li>A community project might convert a recurring Tag (such as <em>Neglected District</em>) into a more favorable one.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Represent these projects with Clocks. When a Clock tied to training or study fills, it grants the planned
        advancement. This keeps progress visible and lets the group decide how much attention to invest in long‑term
        growth versus immediate problems.
      </p>

      <h3 id="gear-advancement">Gear, Resources, and Tags</h3>
      <p>
        Not all growth is on the character sheet. Over time, characters may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure access to better gear or facilities.</li>
        <li>Establish safehouses or workshops that carry Tags like <em>Well‑Equipped</em> or <em>Secure</em>.</li>
        <li>Gain ongoing support from factions, represented as beneficial Conditions or Proficiencies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Treat these as shared advancements. When the group invests heavily in a home base, for example, note its
        Tags and how they affect future scenes (easier recovery, safer planning, more leverage in negotiations). As
        with individual growth, tie these upgrades to on‑screen effort and milestones rather than spontaneous
        appearances.
      </p>

      <h3 id="calibrating-advancement-pacing">Calibrating Pacing and Difficulty</h3>
      <p>
        As characters advance, their chances on many Checks improve. To keep tension, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shift from simple DC 12–14 tasks toward more DC 16–18 challenges as campaigns deepen.</li>
        <li>Introduce broader stakes where success has bigger consequences and Partial Successes matter more.</li>
        <li>Use more Clocks and Tags rather than only raising DCs—strong characters change the shape of problems, not just the numbers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you want a slower‑growth, more grounded campaign, limit Attribute increases and focus advancement on new
        Skills, Proficiencies, and relationships. For more heroic arcs, allow more frequent Attribute growth and
        treat Legendary DCs (22) as reachable when characters stack favorable Tags, Proficiencies, and preparation.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Advancement as Conversation</strong><br />
        Treat advancement decisions as a conversation at the table. Ask players what kinds of challenges they want
        their characters to face next, then steer advancement choices and campaign prep toward those interests. The
        goal is not to “balance” everyone identically but to make sure each character’s growth opens doors they are
        excited to walk through.

    <section id="ch-20-optional-variant-rules">
      <h2 id="optional-variant-rules-heading">20. Optional and Variant Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The core rules are written to cover many tables and genres. You can play entire campaigns using only the
        default procedures in this book. This chapter offers optional and variant rules—dials you can turn to tune
        pacing, difficulty, and tone without breaking the core structure. Treat them as a menu. You do not need all
        of them, and you should add them deliberately rather than all at once.
      </p>

      <h3 id="choosing-variants">Choosing Variants for Your Table</h3>
      <p>
        Before adopting any variant rule, talk about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Desired tone:</strong> grounded, heroic, cozy, horror‑leaning, or something else.</li>
        <li><strong>Pacing:</strong> slow burn campaigns vs fast‑moving series.</li>
        <li><strong>Complexity appetite:</strong> how many moving parts your group enjoys tracking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Start small: choose one or two variants that clearly support your goals. Play with them for several
        sessions. If they work, keep them. If not, remove or revise them with a quick conversation at the table.
      </p>

      <h3 id="pacing-difficulty-variants">Pacing and Difficulty Variants</h3>
      <p>
        These options change how quickly the story escalates and how hard the game feels, without changing the
        core 4d6 + DC structure.

                Clocks, even when the immediate goal is achieved.</td>

        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3 id="table-focused-options">Table‑Focused Options</h3>
      <p>
        These variants focus on how the group makes decisions and shares narrative responsibility, rather than on
        changing numbers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Shared Framing Rotation:</strong> Once per session, a player other than the GM frames a scene:
          where it takes place, who is present, and what is at stake. The GM still runs NPCs and rules, but this
          ensures each player’s interests surface regularly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Player‑Authored Tags:</strong> At the start of each session, invite players to propose one Tag
          each for a location, faction, or situation they care about (“Tense Bargaining Season,” “Storms on the
          Plateau”). The GM weaves these Tags into scenes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rotating Spotlight Questions:</strong> At the end of a session, ask one player a prompt aligned
          with their character (for example, “What did you learn today that scares you?”). Use their answer to seed
          Tags, Conditions, or fronts for the next session.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Player‑Authored Tag</strong><br />
        At session start, a player adds the Tag <em>Festival Week</em> to the city. Throughout play, the GM
        introduces crowded streets, temporary stalls, and visiting dignitaries. Checks involving movement, rumor‑
        gathering, and security now frequently interact with <em>Crowded</em>, <em>Festive</em>, and
        <em>Surveillance</em> Tags the table chose together.
      </div>

      <h3 id="resolution-variants">Resolution Variants</h3>
      <p>
        The core resolution uses a single Check for most actions. These variants adjust how many Checks you use and
        how much narrative weight each roll carries, while still relying on 4d6 and outcome tiers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask Once, Roll Once:</strong> For groups who prefer fewer rolls, resolve complex actions with a
          single Check and a richer outcome. Use Clocks and Tags to represent intermediate steps instead of multiple
          separate Checks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Granular Challenges:</strong> For groups who enjoy tactical detail, break big tasks into several
          linked Checks, each with its own Tag or Clock. Make sure each roll moves the situation forward in a clear
          way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Group Checks:</strong> When the whole group works together and the details of individual rolls
          are less important, have everyone roll but only count a subset (for example, the highest two results) to
          determine the outcome tier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spotlight Checks:</strong> In key emotional scenes, roll once for the character most central to
          the moment and treat others’ contributions as fictional positioning that may influence DC or Tags rather
          than separate rolls.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="safety-calibration-tools">Safety and Calibration Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Safety and calibration tools help your table align on tone and boundaries. They are not optional for every
        group, but they are always available. You can use them alongside any other variant in this chapter.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lines and Veils:</strong> Early in the campaign, the group names topics they do not want in the
          game at all (lines) and topics that can appear only off‑screen or in soft focus (veils). Keep a written
          list and revisit it as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check‑In Breaks:</strong> When a scene touches intense material, pause briefly to ask if everyone
          is comfortable continuing. Adjust course if anyone expresses discomfort.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Open Door:</strong> Make it explicit that any player can step away from the table at any time for
          any reason, without needing to justify it in detail. If they do, the group finds a respectful way to
          pause or continue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tone Calibration:</strong> At the end of a session, ask quick questions like “More danger or less?”
          or “More character drama or more problem‑solving?” Use answers to steer future scenes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Safety Is a Shared Tool</strong><br />
        Safety tools are not just for “heavy” campaigns. They help any table adjust tone and content over time. Treat
        them as part of the rules: visible, normal, and available to everyone.
      </div>

      <h3 id="campaign-structure-variants">Campaign Structure Variants</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, you can adjust how you structure campaigns and advancement together. These variants change the
        rhythm of arcs and how you move between them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Seasonal Play:</strong> Treat each 6–10 session arc as a “season” with its own fronts and central
          questions. Between seasons, hold an advancement and recalibration session where you adjust advancement
          pacing, Tags, and fronts for the next season.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rotating Focus:</strong> Every arc, center one or two characters’ goals while others support. Use
          advancement from Chapter 19 to highlight those goals, then rotate focus for the next arc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>One‑Shot Mode:</strong> For short games, use Heroic Baseline, grant 1–2 advancements mid‑session or
          at the end, and keep fronts and Clocks simple. Treat Tags and Conditions as big, loud signals about what
          matters in a brief story.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You do not need to adopt any variant rule to enjoy the system. When you do choose them, do so in service of
        the stories you want to tell and the ways your table enjoys telling them. The core structure—fiction first,
        4d6 Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—remains the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Part III is written primarily for Game Masters, but curious players are welcome to read it as well. These
        chapters focus on framing sessions and scenes, managing pacing, designing scenarios and campaigns, and
        making effective use of NPCs, VPCs, factions, and fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with the earlier rules, this section forms a complete toolkit for running the game: from first
        session to long‑term arcs, from intimate character drama to sweeping faction conflicts. You can read it

    <section id="ch-21-running-sessions">
      <h2 id="running-sessions-heading">21. Running Sessions</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter helps you turn rules and preparation into a session that feels alive at the table. It focuses
        on what you do moment to moment as a GM: framing scenes, asking questions, calling for Checks, using Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks, and managing pacing so each session feels complete. It assumes a mix of readers:
        brand‑new GMs running their first game and experienced facilitators who are new to Razorweave.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can read this chapter straight through, or you can treat each section as a tool you revisit as needed.
        Early sections focus on mindset and table expectations. Later sections walk through concrete procedures for
        opening, running, and closing sessions across genres.
      </p>

      <h3 id="gm-mindset-for-razorweave">GM Mindset for Razorweave</h3>
      <p>
        In Razorweave, the GM is not an adversary, a referee above the fiction, or a passive narrator. You are a
        <em>facilitator of consequences</em>. You present situations honestly, embody NPCs and factions, and use the
        rules to show how the world pushes back when characters act.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fiction first</strong> means you start from what is true in the world, not from the rule you are
        eager to use. Before you ever reach for dice, ask what the environment is like, what NPCs want, and what the
        characters are actually doing. A dim, rain‑slick alley with jumpy guards and bad lighting already suggests
        certain DCs and Tags. The mechanics follow that picture, not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Consequences, not punishments</strong> means that when a roll goes poorly, you are not “getting
        back” at the players. You are showing the natural outcome of risk in a living world. A failed Check might
        fill a Clock faster than expected, shift a Tag from <em>Curious</em> to <em>Suspicious</em>, or impose a
        Condition that makes future scenes tenser. Outcomes can be sharp and memorable without feeling arbitrary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Shared ownership</strong> means that even though you keep the world coherent and interesting, you
        also share tone, safety, and direction with the table. Ask questions. Invite players to describe details and
        help name Tags. When someone has a strong idea about how a scene might look, fold it into the fiction rather
        than defending your notes.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – The Three Questions</strong><br />
        When you feel stuck in a scene, return to three questions: “What do the NPCs want? What do the players care
        about here? What would happen if no one acted?” The answers almost always suggest the next move, a new Tag,
        or a Clock to start.
      </div>

      <h3 id="session-types-and-structure">Session Types and Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Not every session feels the same. Some are about urgent danger, others about quiet reflection or long‑term
        projects. Recognizing the type of session you are running makes it easier to choose which tools to emphasize.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch sessions</strong> are the first meetings of a campaign or arc. They establish tone, introduce
        safety tools, and give everyone an early success or discovery. You spend more time asking big questions,
        showing off a few striking locations, and letting players show who their characters are.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Middle sessions</strong> are the bulk of play. Fronts advance, Clocks tick, relationships deepen, and
        plans collide with opposition. You focus on presenting problems, showing consequences, and weaving together
        the threads characters care about.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Climactic sessions</strong> resolve long‑running Clocks and fronts. Stakes and consequences are at
        their highest. These sessions often feature multiple linked action or social scenes where previous
        decisions come due and Tags change rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Downtime or bridge sessions</strong> are quieter. Characters recover, pursue projects, and reorient
        between major arcs. You still use Clocks and Tags, but they track healing, research, relationships, and
        preparation rather than immediate danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can blend these elements in a single session, but it helps to choose a primary focus. A launch session
        that suddenly becomes an arc finale may feel rushed; a climactic session that spends most of its time on
        shopping might feel deflated. Use Chapter 19 for deeper guidance on advancement pacing across these types.
      </p>

      <h3 id="before-the-session-prep-and-alignment">Before the Session: Prep and Alignment</h3>
      <p>
        Good sessions begin before everyone sits down. You do not need pages of notes. You do need clarity on what
        you are excited to see, what is already in motion, and what players care about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by briefly <strong>reviewing last time</strong>. Skim your notes, Clocks, and Tags from the previous
        session. Notice which fronts are ready to move, which NPCs were left in tense positions, and which personal
        threads players highlighted. You are looking for momentum: unresolved questions, looming dangers, or
        opportunities that feel too good to ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then <strong>choose a small number of anchors</strong>. Pick two or three elements you want to feature: a
        location, an NPC, a looming Clock, a relationship question. These anchors become the backbone of your scene
        framing. If everything goes sideways, you can still pivot back to one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, whenever you can, <strong>check expectations</strong> with your players. A quick message like “Next
        session I’m planning to focus on the harbor crackdown and your meeting with the magistrate—anything else you
        really want to hit?” gives you a chance to align your anchors with their interests before everyone sits down.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Lightweight Prep</strong><br />
        Before the session, you skim notes and see an 8‑segment <em>Smuggling Crackdown</em> Clock at 5 of 8 and a
        Tag on the harbor, <em>Rumors of Sabotage</em>. You choose three anchors: the harbor at night, a customs
        officer with doubts, and the Clock reaching 6 or 7 segments if the crew hesitates. That is enough to start.
      </div>

      <h3 id="session-agenda-and-rhythm">Session Agenda and Rhythm</h3>
      <p>
        A good session has a clear starting frame, several meaningful situations, and a sense of closure even if the
        story continues. You do not need a script. You need a strong opening, a handful of charged situations, and a
        way to end on purpose.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Strong Opening:</strong> Remind the table where you left off. Reintroduce any active Clocks, key
          Tags, or Conditions. Ask one or two questions that spotlight the characters (“Who has not slept well since
          last time?”).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Middle Situations:</strong> Present locations, NPCs, and problems that invite decisions. Use Tags,
          Clocks, and Checks from earlier chapters to keep pressure moving.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closing Beat:</strong> End on a new question, a consequence, or a moment of reflection. Note which
          Clocks advanced and which Tags or Conditions will matter next time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can write this agenda as a short list on your GM sheet or a visible note. Players do not need to see
        every detail, but sharing a loose structure (“We’ll start in the archive, then see where your investigation
        leads”) helps them plan.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Keep the Agenda Visible</strong><br />
        You can share your session agenda with the table in simple terms: “We’ll open at the harbor, deal with the
        customs inspection, and then see how far you get toward the embassy.” This helps players make choices and
        gives everyone a shared sense of progress.
      </div>

      <h3 id="safety-and-table-comfort-each-session">Safety and Table Comfort Each Session</h3>
      <p>
        Safety and calibration tools from Chapter 20 are not just for campaign setup. Use them inside sessions to
        adjust tone and subject matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple <strong>quick check‑in</strong> at the start of a session—“Anything off‑limits tonight?” or “Is
        there anything you especially want to lean into?”—gives players a chance to name boundaries and desires in
        the moment. You can adjust which fronts you emphasize or how graphically you describe events based on their
        answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        During intense scenes, be ready to <strong>pause in the moment</strong>. If a description or topic lands
        harder than expected, stop, check in, and adjust. You can summarize events or fade to black while still
        applying mechanical consequences such as Conditions or Clock advances. The fiction continues to move, but in
        a form that feels safer.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a heavy scene, consider giving the table a short <strong>aftercare moment</strong>. Take a break, or
        follow up with lighter material, small talk between characters, or a brief montage. Let players shift out of
        character and confirm they feel ready to continue or wrap for the night.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Adjusting a Scene</strong><br />
        In a horror‑tinged investigation, a description of a flooded cellar starts to feel too intense for one
        player. You pause, check in, and agree to keep future descriptions less graphic. The cellar still carries the
        <em>Hazardous</em> and <em>Obscured</em> Tags, and Checks remain risky, but you describe the danger in more
        abstract terms.
      </div>

      <h3 id="framing-and-reframing-scenes">Framing and Reframing Scenes</h3>
      <p>
        A scene begins when you choose where the camera is and what is immediately at stake. A strong frame tells
        players where they are, who is present, what matters right now, and what might happen if nothing changes.
        You then invite the players to respond in character.
      </p>
      <p>
        When framing a scene, lean on Tags and Clocks:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Location Tags</strong> signal environment and position: a “Dimly Lit Warehouse” suggests different
        risks and opportunities than a “Crowded Market” or a bridge that is literally tagged “On Thin Ice.” When you
        name these Tags, you tell players what kinds of actions are natural and what might go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NPC Tags</strong> show attitude and leverage. A contact tagged “Tense” and “Overconfident” will react
        very differently from one tagged “Desperate for Approval.” These Tags help you improvise reactions while
        keeping the character consistent, and they give players something concrete to push against or support.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Clocks</strong> track rising danger, limited time, or evolving opportunities: “Guards Converge,”
        “Storm Front Approaches,” “Negotiations Sour.” When you advance a Clock as part of a new frame, you show how
        the world moves even when the characters are not looking directly at a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reframe a scene whenever the situation has clearly changed. Advance or clear Tags and Clocks, move the
        location, or jump forward in time. Ask players what their next focus is, then frame directly into that
        moment instead of playing out every step along the way.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Reframing Around a Clock</strong><br />
        The crew is sneaking through a surveillance district with a <em>Security Sweep</em> Clock at 3 of 6. After
        several tense Checks, the GM advances the Clock to 4 of 6 and reframes: “Later that night, as you pack up
        your gear, spotlights sweep across your hideout. The <em>Security Sweep</em> Clock is nearly full. What do
        you do?”
      </div>

      <h3 id="calling-for-checks-in-sessions">Calling for Checks in Sessions</h3>
      <p>
        Chapters 8 and 10 explain how Checks work mechanically. At the table, your job is to decide when a Check is
        needed and how to reflect the fiction in DCs, Tags, Conditions, and outcome tiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Begin by <strong>asking first, then rolling</strong>. Always ask players what they do and how before you
        reach for dice. If the outcome is not uncertain or not meaningful, no Check is needed. Conversation and
        description are often enough when characters act within their established capabilities and the stakes are
        low.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a Check is appropriate, <strong>set DCs with context</strong>. Use the DC ladder from Chapter 8, but
        let the fiction shape where you land on that ladder. A task might be Routine in calm conditions but Hard in
        a burning building. Say out loud what makes it easier or harder; this keeps DCs from feeling arbitrary.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you choose DCs, <strong>use Tags and Conditions</strong> as levers. Apply Edge, Burden, or DC
        shifts when Tags and Conditions clearly help or hinder the attempt. A character with the <em>Focused</em>
        Condition tackling a research problem in a <em>Well‑Stocked Archive</em> should feel the difference compared
        to a distracted argument in a noisy tavern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, <strong>show outcomes in the fiction</strong>. When you know the outcome tier, describe what it
        looks like in the scene, not just the numbers on the dice. Success should change the situation in ways
        everyone can feel; Failure and Partial Success should leave marks on Tags, Conditions, or Clocks.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Check with Tags and Outcome Tiers</strong><br />
        The group tries to cross a slick rooftop in high wind. The location has <em>Slick</em> and <em>Elevated</em>
        Tags. The GM calls for a 4d6 Check using AGI and an appropriate Skill, DC 16 (Tough), with Burden from
        <em>Slick</em>. A Partial Success means someone slides toward the edge and starts a <em>Falling</em> Clock.
        A Failure fills several segments at once.
      </div>

      <h3 id="using-tags-conditions-and-clocks-during-play">Using Tags, Conditions, and Clocks During Play</h3>
      <p>
        Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are not just record‑keeping tools. They are how you signal what matters right
        now and what might change next. During a session:
      </p>
      <p>
        When the fiction shifts, <strong>announce new Tags</strong>. Say it out loud and write it down: “The alley
        is now <em>Crowded</em> and <em>Tense</em>.” This tells players what they should picture and what will
        matter mechanically in the next few moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Clocks move, <strong>point at their progress</strong>. When you advance a Clock, briefly describe what
        that looks like: more guards on the street, sirens in the distance, rumors spreading through the market. Let
        players see and feel the change instead of only hearing “the Clock ticks up.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When a character gains a Condition, <strong>treat it as a promise</strong> about how future scenes will
        unfold. “Shaken” means fear may resurface at a bad moment. “Backed by Authority” means doors open more
        easily—until that authority falters. Conditions are story hooks as much as mechanical modifiers.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Speak Your Mechanics</strong><br />
        When you create or change a Tag, Condition, or Clock, pair the mechanical note with a short narrative
        description. This keeps players immersed and makes the system feel like part of the story, not a separate
        layer.
      </div>

      <h3 id="pacing-spotlight-and-breaks">Pacing, Spotlight, and Breaks</h3>
      <p>
        Pacing is about how quickly the situation changes and how often each character gets a meaningful chance to
        act. You can adjust pacing by how you cut between characters, how much you summarize, and how often you
        escalate Clocks or introduce new Tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of your simplest tools is to <strong>rotate the spotlight</strong>. After one character’s action
        resolves, check in with someone else—“What are you doing while this happens?”—and let them move the story
        forward. In complex scenes, especially with split groups, this rotation keeps everyone engaged and reminds
        you to track multiple fronts at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also <strong>summarize transitions</strong> instead of playing out each moment in real time. Skip
        unimportant travel, shopping, or small talk. Jump to the next moment where something is at stake: the
        confrontation, the discovery, the evening’s quiet conversation that might change a relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, <strong>use breaks intentionally</strong>. Short pauses let players process intense scenes and give
        you a moment to review Clocks and Tags. Consider pausing after major outcome tiers or before big choices so
        everyone can think about what they want to do next.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – When in Doubt, Slow Down</strong><br />
        If a moment feels emotionally important or tactically complex, slow the pace. Ask players what their
        characters are thinking. Clarify stakes and Tags. A deliberate pause often makes the next decision feel more
        meaningful.
      </div>

      <h3 id="running-different-kinds-of-scenes">Running Different Kinds of Scenes</h3>
      <p>
        Different scenes highlight different parts of the system. The following guidance helps you lean into the
        strengths of each type without losing the core 4d6 structure.
      </p>

      <h4 id="investigation-and-mystery-scenes">Investigation and Mystery Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        Investigations work best when information flows freely and Checks are about risk, not whether players can
        “find the plot.” Give clues generously. Use Checks to determine how quickly they find them, what extra
        context they gain, and what complications arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Set DCs lower when characters are simply uncovering basic facts. The challenge comes from what they do with
        the information, not whether they can spot a file on a shelf. Raise DCs when they push for leverage—trying
        to get a confession without causing alarm, for example—or when they are racing a rival or the clock. Use
        Clocks to track rival investigators, evidence disappearing, or rising suspicion, and Tags like
        <em>Under Watch</em>, <em>Loose Files</em>, or <em>Community Mistrust</em> to shape how each scene feels.
      </p>

      <h4 id="social-and-negotiation-scenes">Social and Negotiation Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        Social scenes rely on clear goals, visible stakes, and strong NPC desires. Decide what each side wants and
        what they are unwilling to give up. Use Checks to resolve key turning points, not every line of dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make the NPC’s Tags and Conditions visible in play: “He seems <em>Nervous</em> but clearly
        <em>Backed by Authority</em>.” Use Clocks to track trust, patience, or public opinion, and let Partial
        Successes shift Tags instead of ending negotiations outright—“Distrustful” becomes “Wary but Listening,”
        which invites a second attempt rather than closing the door.
      </p>

      <h4 id="action-and-combat-scenes">Action and Combat Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        Chapter 10 provides the core combat structure. In this chapter, focus on how action scenes fit into the
        rhythm of a session. Treat each action scene as a short story: establish position and intent, escalate
        danger, and show clear consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use environmental Tags generously—cover, hazards, high ground—and invite players to interact with them. Track
        enemy goals with Clocks rather than focusing only on harm: “Hostages Moved,” “Reactor Overheats,” “Reinforcements
        Arrive.” When harm does land, lean on Conditions for injury and morale; a single <em>Wounded</em> Condition
        can matter more than a series of tiny numerical reductions.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Multi‑Phase Action Scene</strong><br />
        In a sci‑fi setting, the characters try to escape a failing orbital lab. You set a <em>Structural Collapse</em>
        Clock at 0 of 8 and Tag the environment as <em>Unstable</em> and <em>Low Gravity</em>. Early Checks are about
        navigation and securing equipment. As the Clock advances, new Tags appear (<em>Smoke</em>, <em>Sparks</em>),
        and later Checks involve dodging debris and getting the airlock open before the Clock fills.
      </div>

      <h4 id="quiet-reflective-and-downtime-scenes">Quiet, Reflective, and Downtime Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        Not every moment needs high tension. Downtime scenes let characters recover, pursue projects, and explore
        relationships. They support advancement triggers from Chapter 19 and deepen the emotional stakes of later
        conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask open questions about feelings, goals, and doubts, then let players narrate short montages of how their
        characters spend time. Use Clocks and Tags to track long‑term projects and emotional threads rather than
        immediate danger—research, training, community work, repairing trust. Call for Checks only when a project
        faces meaningful risk or uncertainty, not for routine tasks that would reasonably succeed.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ending-sessions-cleanly">Ending Sessions Cleanly</h3>
      <p>
        End sessions on purpose. A clean ending helps everyone remember where you left off and gives you material
        for advancement and fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you close your notebook, <strong>review open Clocks</strong>. Note which ones advanced, which are
        close to completion, and which new Clocks appeared. Think about what each Clock means in the fiction, and
        write a short phrase next to it if that helps (“security on edge,” “union gaining support”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then <strong>recap Tags and Conditions</strong>. List any persistent Tags or Conditions that will carry
        forward into the next session—changes to locations, factions, or characters that the group should remember.
        Saying them out loud anchors them in everyone’s mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, <strong>invite reflection</strong>. Ask each player for a highlight, a surprise, or a new question
        about the world. Use their answers to apply advancement triggers from Chapter 19 and to shape fronts and
        factions for future sessions. You can also adjust difficulty dials from Chapter 20 if the group wants more
        pressure, more room to breathe, or a shift in tone.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – End of Session Recap</strong><br />
        After dismantling a smuggling ring, the group reviews their notes. The <em>Smuggling Crackdown</em> Clock is
        full, and the harbor’s Tags shift from <em>Lawless</em> to <em>Tense but Watched</em>. One character takes an
        advancement in a relevant Skill, another gains the edge Condition <em>Respected by Dockworkers</em>. The GM
        notes a new front: <em>Corporate Retaliation</em>, seeded by the group’s success.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-22-running-campaigns">
      <h2 id="running-campaigns-heading">22. Running Campaigns</h2>

      <p>
        A campaign is a series of connected sessions that follow the same characters, themes, and pressures over
        time. This chapter helps you turn individual adventures into arcs, connect arcs into larger stories, and
        use advancement, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks to track long‑term change.
      </p>

      <h3 id="campaign-shape-and-length">Campaign Shape and Length</h3>
      <p>
        Campaigns come in many shapes. Some are short, focused arcs. Others are sprawling journeys with multiple
        fronts. The system assumes campaigns are built from arcs: clusters of sessions that focus on one central
        problem or question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Short arcs</strong>, typically three to five sessions long, revolve around a single front or
        problem. A crime spree in one district, a contested political vote, or a rescue mission behind enemy lines
        can all form the spine of a short arc. These arcs are ideal for testing a new setting or running a limited
        “season” between longer campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medium arcs</strong> last closer to six to ten sessions. They involve several interlinked fronts,
        at least one major faction, and a clear turning point where the direction of the story changes. A labor
        dispute that escalates into city‑wide unrest, or a mystery that uncovers a deeper conspiracy, often fits
        this scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Long arcs</strong> stretch beyond ten sessions. They weave together multiple fronts that evolve
        over time, recurring NPCs who grow and change, and locations whose Tags shift as the campaign progresses.
        Long arcs benefit from regular pauses to reflect on what has changed and whether the table wants to
        continue in the same direction or pivot toward new threats and opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decide the starting size of your first arc and be transparent with players. This helps set expectations for
        tone, pacing, and how quickly advancement will appear.
      </p>

      <h3 id="setting-up-a-new-campaign">Setting Up a New Campaign</h3>
      <p>
        Before your first session, talk with your players about the kind of story you want to tell. Use questions
        to define tone, themes, and constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask what kinds of problems everyone wants to face: mystery and investigation, survival against harsh
        conditions, political maneuvering, heists and infiltration, or a blend of several. Talk about how intense
        you want danger and horror to be, from gentle tension to truly harrowing stakes. Discuss which parts of the
        setting are most exciting—factions, technology, magic, community, or something stranger—and how often you
        expect to play together, and for how long each session will run.
      </p>
      <p>
        Translate these answers into Tags and initial fronts: named threats or pressures with Clocks attached (see
        Chapter 25 for a deeper front framework). Prepare a few starting locations and NPCs that express those
        themes.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Campaign Setup</strong><br />
        The group chooses a campaign about workers organizing in a hazardous sky‑dock. The GM defines a
        <em>Corporate Crackdown</em> front with a 6‑segment Clock, Tags like <em>Surveillance</em> and
        <em>Hazardous</em>, and key NPCs in management and the union. Early sessions revolve around protests,
        sabotage, and negotiations.
      </div>

      <h3 id="advancement-and-long-term-change">Advancement and Long‑Term Change</h3>
      <p>
        Chapter 19 explains how characters advance. In a campaign, advancement also reflects how the world changes.
        As characters grow, update location and faction Tags, retire old Clocks, and introduce new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever possible, tie Attribute, Skill, and Proficiency advancements to specific scenes and decisions. A
        new Skill might grow out of repeated investigative work in a particular archive, while a Proficiency in
        “Harbor Operations” emerges from hard‑won experience dodging inspections. Naming these connections in play
        makes advancement feel earned and grounded in the fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edge Conditions—such as <em>Backed by Authority</em>, <em>Inspired</em>, or <em>Sheltered</em>—are also
        signs of long‑term change. Use them to mark new advantages the group has earned: a patron’s protection, a
        community’s trust, or a personal breakthrough. When those Conditions appear, think about how they might
        shape upcoming scenes and fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a Clock completes, pause to ask what is permanently different in the world now. Has a faction gained
        or lost power? Has a neighborhood’s Tag shifted from <em>Marginalized</em> to <em>Organized</em>? Over
        time, your campaign map should show scars and growth: old Tags crossed out, new Tags added, fronts resolved
        or transformed rather than quietly forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, your campaign map should show scars and growth: old Tags crossed out, new Tags added, fronts
        resolved or transformed.
      </p>

      <h3 id="between-session-prep">Between‑Session Prep</h3>
      <p>
        Between sessions, keep prep light and focused. You do not need to predict everything players will do. You
        only need to know how the world responds to what already happened and what pressures are rising.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by advancing or adjusting active fronts and Clocks based on the last session’s events. If players
        ignored a looming threat, decide how it moves forward. If they struck a decisive blow, consider whether a
        Clock should tick backward, stall, or be replaced by a new, more subtle danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then choose two or three likely scenes or locations for the next session. You do not need to lock them in;
        they are waypoints you can steer toward or away from depending on player choices. As you review your notes,
        update NPC Tags to reflect recent outcomes and jot down any advancement triggers you want to highlight,
        such as resolved personal threads or significant sacrifices.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Prep Questions, Not Scripts</strong><br />
        Instead of writing a detailed sequence of scenes, prepare questions the next session might answer: “Who will
        the union trust?” “How far will the corporation go?” Let player choices and outcomes decide how those
        questions resolve.
      </div>

      <h3 id="ending-arcs-and-starting-new-ones">Ending Arcs and Starting New Ones</h3>
      <p>
        When a major front concludes or a central Clock completes, you have reached the end of an arc. Take time to
        mark this in the fiction and in the mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hold a reflection scene or brief epilogue that shows the consequences of recent events. Let players see how
        their actions changed NPCs, neighborhoods, and factions. This is a natural moment to apply a round of
        advancement, especially for relationships and reputations, and to talk about what each character has
        learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you close the arc, update or retire Tags and Conditions that no longer apply. A city that was once
        <em>Occupied</em> might now be tagged <em>Uncertain Governance</em>. A character who carried <em>Haunted by
        the Siege</em> for many sessions might finally resolve that Condition—or transform it into something new.
        Introduce new fronts or questions that point toward the next arc, even if you do not know exactly how they
        will unfold yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ending arcs cleanly makes campaigns feel intentional rather than endless. It also gives players natural
        points to retire characters, adjust expectations, or shift focus to different parts of the world. Use these
        transitions to check in about tone, pacing, and which themes everyone wants to explore next.

      <h2 id="designing-scenarios-heading">23. Designing Scenarios and One Shots</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter focuses on designing concrete scenarios: specific problems, locations, and NPCs that players
        will confront. It also gives guidance for one‑shot play, where you have limited time and want a strong,
        self‑contained story.
      </p>

      <h3 id="scenario-design-principles">Scenario Design Principles</h3>
      <p>
        A good scenario is built on clear stakes, interesting choices, and pressures that escalate over time. It
        does not require a fixed plot. It needs a situation that cannot stay the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Begin by <strong>defining the stakes</strong>. Ask what happens if the characters succeed, fail, or walk
        away. Tie those outcomes to people, places, and values the group cares about: a neighborhood’s safety, a
        fragile peace treaty, a personal promise. When everyone understands what is on the line, even simple scenes
        feel charged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, <strong>identify the pressures</strong> that make the situation unstable. Use Clocks and Tags to
        represent time limits, looming threats, and shifting opportunities. A “Festival Week” Tag might make a city
        more crowded and distract guards, while a “Bridge Sabotage” Clock ticks up as the villains move toward
        their goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, <strong>offer multiple approaches</strong>. Design scenarios that reward different Skills and
        strategies: talking, sneaking, researching, fighting, or working through community networks. Players should
        be able to solve the problem in more than one way, and the system should support those choices through
        Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks.
      </p>

      <h3 id="from-fronts-to-individual-scenarios">From Fronts to Individual Scenarios</h3>
      <p>
        Most campaigns in Razorweave are driven by fronts and factions (see Chapter 25). Scenarios are how you zoom
        in on one moment in that larger struggle. When you design a scenario, you are asking: “What does this front
        look like <em>today</em>, in this specific place, through these characters’ eyes?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose one front that feels active and write a short summary of how it manifests in the immediate future.
        A “Corporate Crackdown” front might show up as surprise inspections at the docks, or a “Famine Looms”
        front might appear as ration lines and grain hoarding. That manifestation becomes the seed for your
        scenario; the wider front explains why events keep escalating even if the characters handle the problem in
        front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have that seed, connect it back to stakes and pressures. Decide who will be helped or harmed if
        nothing changes, then use Tags and Clocks to express that pressure in the scene. By keeping the scenario
        tightly connected to a front, you ensure that even one‑shot adventures still move the larger campaign
        forward.
      </p>

      <h3 id="building-blocks-locations-npcs">Building Blocks: Locations, NPCs, and Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Most scenarios are built from a small set of locations and NPCs connected by clear pressures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create <strong>locations</strong> with two or three Tags and a few sensory details. A canal‑side tavern
        might be tagged <em>Smoky</em>, <em>Crowded</em>, and <em>Well‑Connected</em>, with descriptions of damp
        wood and low music. Think about how Checks at that location will interact with those Tags—who can hide in
        the crowd, who will be overheard, who might slip on the wet stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give each important <strong>NPC</strong> a role, a clear desire, and one or two Tags that describe their
        posture or leverage. A clerk who wants to keep their job at any cost feels different from a bored guard
        looking for an excuse to talk, even if both are technically “obstacles.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Attach <strong>Clocks</strong> to events that move regardless of player action: a storm arriving, a ritual
        completing, a patrol pattern cycling. These Clocks turn background details into active pressures that shape
        choices and give you a way to escalate tension without inventing new threats from nowhere.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Scenario Building Blocks</strong><br />
        A heist scenario might include a <em>Guarded Vault</em> (Tags: <em>Surveillance</em>, <em>Hazardous</em>),
        a suspicious clerk (Tags: <em>Nervous</em>, <em>Underpaid</em>), and a <em>Shift Change</em> Clock that
        advances whenever time passes or noise is made.
      </div>

      <h3 id="information-flow-and-clues">Information Flow and Clue Mapping</h3>
      <p>
        Investigative scenarios live or die on how information moves. In this system, core clues should be
        discoverable without high‑risk Checks. Rolls are for how quickly the group connects the dots, what extra
        context they pick up, and what complications emerge along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you design a mystery, list the key truths that players need in order to act—who is involved, what they
        want, where critical scenes might happen. Then place each truth in two or three different places: a
        location, an NPC, a document, a rumor. If players miss one entry point, another remains available. Checks
        gate how costly or noisy it is to get that information, not whether the information exists at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clocks and Tags help you manage failure without stalling the story. A failed research Check might advance a
        “Rival Investigators Close In” Clock rather than erase a clue from the world. A Partial Success might reveal
        the right lead but add a <em>Watched by the Watch</em> Tag to the neighborhood. Information continues to
        flow, but the world grows more complicated in response.
      </p>

      <h3 id="one-shot-structure">One‑Shot Structure</h3>
      <p>
        One‑shots compress the arc of setup, rising action, and resolution into a single session. To keep the pace
        satisfying, design with fewer locations, sharper stakes, and more visible Clocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limit yourself to just a few major locations and a handful of key NPCs. You do not have time to explore an
        entire city; focus on the dockside warehouse, the gala ballroom, or the frontier outpost that matters
        tonight. Introduce the central problem quickly—ideally within the first fifteen to twenty minutes—so players
        can spend most of the session responding rather than orienting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use one or two big Clocks that everyone can see and feel advancing. “Storm Breaks Over the City,”
        “Inquisitors Close In,” or “The Train Reaches the Broken Bridge” give a constant sense of momentum. Be
        generous with information; players need enough clues and context to make strong choices quickly without
        feeling rushed or lost.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Start In Motion</strong><br />
        For one‑shots, open in the middle of action: on the train as it approaches the bridge, in the courtroom as
        testimony begins, at the threshold of the haunted facility. Ask a few clarifying questions, then let the
        situation unfold.
      </div>

      <h3 id="multi-session-scenarios">Multi‑Session Scenarios</h3>
      <p>
        Some scenarios are large enough to span several sessions without becoming full campaigns on their own. A
        three‑part heist, a long voyage with multiple ports of call, or a festival week with brewing unrest can all
        be treated as multi‑session scenarios. The key is to break them into phases, each with its own stakes and
        Clocks, while keeping a clear through‑line.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common structure is “setup, escalation, resolution.” In the setup phase, characters gather information,
        build relationships, and position themselves. In the escalation phase, fronts push back, Clocks advance, and
        difficult choices close some paths while opening others. In the resolution phase, the biggest Clocks fill or
        are averted, and the world changes in a visible way. Each phase can roughly map to one or two sessions,
        depending on how your table likes to play.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of each phase, take a moment to adjust Tags and Clocks. A neighborhood might shift from
        <em>Tense</em> to <em>On Edge</em>, or a faction might gain the edge Condition <em>Emboldened Supporters</em>.
        These adjustments remind everyone that the scenario is moving forward, even if the final confrontation has
        not yet happened.
      </p>

      <h3 id="genre-variants-for-scenarios">Genre Variants for Scenarios</h3>
      <p>
        The same structural tools—stakes, Tags, Conditions, Clocks—behave differently across genres. When you
        design scenarios, let your chosen slice (cozy, fantasy, horror/mystery, modern, sci‑fi) shape how pressure
        feels and what “failure” looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <strong>cozy</strong> scenario, Clocks might track emotional distance, community events, or looming
        misunderstandings rather than physical danger. A “Harvest Fair” scenario could revolve around saving a
        beloved tradition from bureaucratic neglect, with Tags like <em>Warm Lanterns</em> and <em>Thin Budget</em>.
        Failure might mean disappointment or missed connections instead of disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <strong>fantasy</strong> or <strong>adventure</strong> scenario, physical danger is more common, but it
        should still be grounded in relationships and consequences. A dungeon is more than rooms with traps; it is a
        place tied to factions, history, and myth. Tags like <em>Forgotten Oaths</em>, <em>Lingering Magic</em>, or
        <em>Unstable Passageways</em> can inspire Checks that go beyond “open the door” or “fight the guardian.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>horror and mystery</strong>, Clocks track creeping dread and the spread of corruption or
        knowledge. Failure rarely stops the story; it reveals something terrible at a worse time. Consider Tags such
        as <em>Shifting Shadows</em>, <em>Whispers in the Walls</em>, or <em>Everyone Knows but No One Says</em>.
        Safety tools from Chapter 20 are especially important here to keep the experience intense but consensual.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>modern</strong> or <strong>near‑future</strong> scenarios, institutions and media become part of
        the fiction. Clocks might track news cycles, public outrage, or legal consequences. A “leak the evidence”
        scenario could feature Tags like <em>Always Online</em>, <em>Spin Machine</em>, and <em>Jaded Audience</em>,
        with outcomes changing which communities are willing to help the characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>science‑fiction</strong> scenarios, environment and technology are front and center. Space
        stations, starships, and off‑world colonies all encourage Tags such as <em>Life Support Strained</em>,
        <em>Unstable Gravity</em>, or <em>Corporate Patent Lock</em>. Clocks might track orbital windows or system
        failures. Even here, keep the focus on people: who lives with these technologies, and what they are afraid
        of losing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="worked-example-scenario">Worked Example: The Skybridge Sabotage</h3>
      <p>
        To see these tools in motion, imagine a short arc built around a single scenario: preventing the sabotage of
        a vital skybridge that connects two districts of a floating city. The front is <em>Trade War Escalation</em>,
        with a Clock that will fill if the bridge is destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You begin by defining stakes. If the bridge falls, thousands of workers lose access to jobs and resources,
        and one faction gains a ruthless bargaining chip. If it is saved, trade continues, but whoever is blamed for
        the attempt may face a backlash. Walking away is also a choice; in that case, the city’s Tags might shift
        toward <em>Fragmented</em> and <em>Desperate</em>, and future scenarios will reflect that fracture.
      </p>
      <p>
        You sketch three locations: the bridge itself (Tags: <em>Exposed</em>, <em>Wind‑Swept</em>), a nearby union
        hall (<em>Organized</em>, <em>Overworked</em>), and a corporate control tower (<em>Surveilled</em>,
        <em>Restricted Access</em>). Each location suggests natural scenes and Checks, from rallying workers to
        sneaking into maintenance tunnels to confronting executives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key NPCs include a union organizer who suspects something is wrong but lacks proof, a security chief torn
        between loyalty and doubt, and a saboteur who believes destroying the bridge will prevent a worse outcome.
        Each has a clear desire and Tags to match—perhaps <em>Committed but Tired</em>, <em>By‑the‑Book</em>, and
        <em>Haunted by Past Disaster</em>. Their conflicting goals create choices even before any dice are rolled.
      </p>
      <p>
        You add Clocks: <em>Explosives Planted</em> (4 segments), <em>Security Lockdown</em> (6 segments), and
        <em>Public Blame Misplaced</em> (8 segments). Early investigative scenes advance the first Clock if the
        group lingers; public missteps might tick up the third. In action scenes, failed or Partial Success Checks
        can push any of these Clocks forward, ensuring that tension rises even when characters make progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the table, you might run this scenario as a one‑shot by starting with the organizer bursting into the
        union hall shouting that something is wrong, or as a multi‑session arc by spending more time exploring the
        politics around the bridge. In both cases, the underlying design stays the same: clear stakes, defined
        pressures, locations and NPCs with Tags, and Clocks that track how close the city is to a point of no
        return.
      </p>

      <h3 id="adapting-scenarios-to-the-table">Adapting Scenarios to the Table</h3>
      <p>
        Even well‑designed scenarios will shift once players engage with them. Be ready to adjust DCs, Tags, and
        Clocks based on creative approaches and new information.
      </p>
      <p>
        When players come up with clever plans that skip parts of your scenario, treat that as success, not a
        problem. Reward them rather than forcing them back onto unused material. If a planned threat no longer feels
        relevant, retire its Clock and introduce a new one that reflects the current situation instead of insisting
        on the original script.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invite players to define minor details—“What does the old guild hall look like now?”—to keep the world
        grounded in their perspectives. Their answers often suggest new Tags, NPCs, or Clocks that you can weave
        into future scenarios. Over time, build a library of reusable locations and situations that you can
        re‑skin for different genres and campaigns by changing Tags, NPCs, and stakes while keeping the underlying
        structure.
      </p>

    <section id="ch-24-npcs-vpcs-enemies">
      <h2 id="npcs-vpcs-enemies-heading">24. NPCs, VPCs, and Enemies</h2>

      <p>
        Non‑player characters (NPCs), Virtual Player Characters (VPCs), and enemies are how the world speaks and
        pushes back. This chapter focuses on making them vivid in the fiction and easy to run at the table without
        heavy stat blocks.
      </p>

      <h3 id="npcs-and-vpcs-defined">NPCs and VPCs Defined</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>NPCs</strong> are any characters controlled by the GM: allies, bystanders, antagonists, and
        everything in between. They provide texture, information, obstacles, and opportunities. Most NPCs appear
        occasionally and do not need the full mechanical detail of a player character.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#vpc" class="glossary-link"><strong id="vpc-definition">VPCs (Virtual Player Characters)</strong></a> are GM‑run companions that fill out the party when there
        are not enough players. In solo play, a VPC might be the protagonist’s closest ally. In small groups, VPCs
        cover missing skills or roles so the party can tackle a wider range of challenges. They use the same rules
        as PCs but are run in a way that keeps decision‑making and spotlight with the human players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mechanically, there is still no strict line between an NPC and a VPC. The difference is about <em>function</em>.
        VPCs are built and advanced more like PCs and travel with the group session after session. NPCs, even
        important ones, usually appear in fewer scenes and can be represented with lighter stats. Both use Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks; VPCs simply do so from the “inside” of the party instead of the outside.
      </p>

      <h3 id="vpc-roles-and-spotlight">VPC Roles and Spotlight</h3>
      <p>
        VPCs exist to support player characters, not replace them. They carry part of the mechanical load—extra
        Skills, coverage of missing Proficiencies, extra bodies in dangerous scenes—while leaving core decisions and
        moral weight in the players’ hands. Used well, they make solo and small‑party games feel like full ensembles
        without drowning out the human voices at the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you design a VPC, decide what <strong>party role</strong> they fill. In a solo game, you might pair the
        protagonist with one or two VPCs who cover combat support, investigation, or social presence. In a three‑
        player group, you might add a VPC medic or logistics expert so that the party can survive harder scenarios.
        The VPC should clearly complement the party’s concept: filling gaps, not duplicating spotlight characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        VPCs also help you manage spotlight, especially in solo play. When a lone player is unsure what to do next,
        a VPC can ask them a question in character or offer an imperfect plan that invites disagreement: “We could
        take the main road and risk the checkpoints, unless you see another way.” In group play, let VPCs speak up
        occasionally, then look to the PCs for final choices. Treat VPCs as mirrors and sounding boards, not as
        engines that drive the story on their own.
      </p>

      <h3 id="vpc-arcs-and-advancement">VPC Arcs and Advancement</h3>
      <p>
        Just like PCs, VPCs change over time. Their Tags, Conditions, and relationships should evolve as fronts
        advance and as they succeed or fail alongside the group. You do not have to track their advancement as
        precisely as a full player sheet, but you should know how each major arc has affected them.
      </p>
      <p>
        After an arc concludes, ask a few questions about each important VPC. What did they gain or lose while
        travelling with the party? Did any of their core beliefs shift in response to the PCs’ choices? Have they
        earned a new edge Condition such as <em>Backed by Authority</em>, <em>Trusted by the Crew</em>, or
        <em>Carrying Quiet Doubts</em>? Updating a handful of Tags and notes is often enough to keep them feeling
        alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a VPC’s journey reaches a natural end—retirement, promotion, settling down, moving on to another
        mission—mark it as a major moment in the campaign. In solo and small‑party games, the departure of a VPC can
        be as emotionally significant as a PC advancement or sacrifice. Give those moments space at the table: short
        epilogues, good‑bye scenes, or opportunities to see how the VPC’s life continues off‑screen.
      </p>

      <h3 id="building-compelling-npcs">Building Compelling NPCs</h3>
      <p>
        Start with role, desire, and a few details. Then layer on Tags and relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Begin with their <strong>role</strong>. What job or social function do they fulfill? Dock quartermaster,
        archivist, street medic, minor noble, maintenance engineer—all of these roles say something about who the
        character meets, what they know, and where they spend their time. Role anchors the NPC in the setting’s
        everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a clear <strong>desire</strong>: what do they want right now, in this phase of the story? Some desires
        are small and immediate (“finish this shift and go home”), others long‑term (“prove my theory about the
        anomalies in the telegraph lines”). Desire tells you how they will react when the PCs ask for help or push
        against their boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose one or two <strong>details</strong> that make the NPC easy to remember: a gesture, a pattern of
        speech, a recurring prop, a particular smell. Details should be quick to note and easy to bring back later.
        Over time, you can add more, but even a single consistent trait goes a long way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, assign a few <strong>Tags</strong> that describe attitude, resources, or vulnerabilities:
        <em>Overworked</em>, <em>Soft‑Spoken</em>, <em>Connected to the Docks</em>, <em>Haunted by Loss</em>.
        These Tags help you improvise DC shifts, Edge or Burden, and likely consequences. They also make
        it clear what might change if the PCs support or pressure this NPC over many sessions.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – quick NPC</strong><br />
        <em>Marla, Dock Quartermaster</em> – Role: gatekeeper for cargo. Desire: avoid trouble and keep shipments
        moving. Details: ink‑stained fingers, never looks up from the ledger. Tags: <em>Overworked</em>,
        <em>Pragmatic</em>, <em>Knows the Rumor Network</em>.
      </div>

      <h3 id="designing-strong-vpcs">Designing Strong VPCs</h3>
      <p>
        VPCs use the same ingredients as other NPCs—role, desire, details, Tags—but you layer them more densely.
        They benefit from clear <strong>trajectories</strong>: questions about where they might end up if no one
        intervenes, and how the PCs might alter that path.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you create a VPC, write down two or three possible destinations for their arc. For example, a young
        inspector might end up as a trusted ally inside the bureaucracy, a disgraced whistleblower on the run, or a
        hardened enforcer who closes ranks against the PCs. You do not need to decide which outcome will occur in
        advance. Let Clocks, Tags, and play at the table reveal it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treat important VPCs as candidates for <strong>Edge and Burden anchors</strong>. When they are
        present in a scene, their Tags should influence DCs and dice pools. A VPC tagged <em>Respected in the
        Union</em> might grant Edge on negotiations with workers, while one tagged <em>Burned Too Many
        Bridges</em> might impose Burden in those same conversations. This mechanical weight signals their
        importance without requiring complex stat blocks.
      </p>

      <h3 id="enemies-and-opposition">Enemies and Opposition</h3>
      <p>
        Enemies are NPCs, creatures, or forces that actively oppose the characters. Instead of complex stat blocks,
        focus on what makes them dangerous and how they change the fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give each enemy a clear <strong>threat concept</strong>—a short phrase that captures why they matter:
        “relentless hunter,” “arsonist cell,” “ancient machine,” “quiet propagandist.” This concept guides
        everything else: how they move, what they target, what they ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that concept, define a few <strong>moves</strong> or typical actions that express the threat in play.
        A relentless hunter appears where characters feel safe; an arsonist cell strikes where security is thin and
        escape routes are narrow; an ancient machine reshapes the environment in ways that ignore political
        boundaries. You do not need a long list—two or three moves that you can deploy flexibly are enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attach <strong>Tags</strong> and <strong>Clocks</strong> to their presence so the threat interacts cleanly
        with the rest of the system. “Pinned Down,” “Reinforcements Arrive,” and “Override Sequence Active” are all
        examples of how an enemy’s progress can be tracked and felt. When you advance an enemy Clock, describe what
        happens in the fiction; when a Tag changes, show what new opportunities or dangers appear.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Enemy with Clocks</strong><br />
        A masked arsonist group operates in the industrial district. Tags: <em>Fanatical</em>, <em>Mobile</em>.
        Moves: strike where security is thin, spread fear through rumors. Clocks: <em>Fires Escalate</em> (4‑segment)
        and <em>Public Blames the Wrong People</em> (6‑segment).
      </div>

      <h3 id="running-npcs-in-checks-and-combat">Running NPCs in Checks and Combat</h3>
      <p>
        When NPCs and enemies act, use the same resolution structure as you do for characters. Checks, Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks keep everyone on the same footing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <strong>NPC Tags</strong> to adjust DCs or apply Edge and Burden when they attempt actions.
        A veteran duelist with Tags like <em>Calm Under Fire</em> and <em>Reads Footwork</em> should feel harder to
        deceive or disarm than a bored guard tagged <em>Distracted</em>. The same framework from Chapter 8 applies:
        Tags describe risk and impact, which in turn shape DCs and dice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <strong>Conditions</strong> to mark injury, fear, leverage, or doubt instead of tracking detailed hit
        points or morale scores. An enemy who is <em>Wounded</em>, <em>Shaken</em>, or <em>Cornered</em> behaves
        differently from one who is fresh and confident. For VPCs, Conditions can track emotional or political
        states (“On Thin Ice with the Council,” “Carrying Survivors’ Guilt”) that matter as much as physical harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <strong>Clocks</strong> to represent an enemy’s—or a VPC’s—progress toward a goal rather than counting
        down every individual blow or argument. A “Duel Slips Out of Control” Clock can fill as tempers flare,
        regardless of who is technically “winning” each exchange. A “Council Sways to Our Side” Clock might track a
        VPC’s political campaign in the background while the PCs pursue other fronts.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Show What Enemies Want</strong><br />
        Enemies are more interesting when their goals are visible. Let players see what might happen if they do
        nothing: the ritual nearing completion, the deal closing, the escape route being cut off. Use Clocks and
        Tags to keep those goals in view.

      <h2 id="factions-fronts-heading">25. Factions, Fronts, and World Pressure</h2>

      <p>
        Factions and fronts are how you model large‑scale forces in the world: organizations, movements, disasters,
        conspiracies, and other pressures that evolve over time. This chapter shows how to turn them into clear,
        actionable tools for play.
      </p>

      <h3 id="defining-factions">Defining Factions</h3>
      <p>
        A faction is any organized group with shared goals. Factions can be formal (guilds, corporations, orders) or
        informal (neighborhood networks, underground movements, families).
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by defining the faction’s <strong>name and identity</strong>. What are they called, and how do they
        present themselves to the world? A workers’ council, a scientific enclave, an undercity syndicate, or a
        temple order all communicate tone and values through their names, symbols, and public rituals. Identity
        tells you how people talk about the faction and how its members recognize one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clarify the faction’s <strong>goals</strong>: what they are trying to achieve in the short and long term. A
        neighborhood mutual aid group might want to keep families fed this month and eventually push back against
        predatory landlords. A corporate research division might want to hit quarterly milestones while secretly
        pursuing a disruptive breakthrough. Goals give you levers to pull when the PCs interact with the faction:
        what they will bargain for, what they will sacrifice, and what they will never willingly give up.
      </p>
      <p>
        List the faction’s <strong>resources</strong>: people, tools, territory, secrets, and reputation. Resources
        explain why the faction matters. A group with few members but crucial information can be as powerful in play
        as a large guild with warehouses and security forces. Finally, assign two to four <strong>Tags</strong> that
        capture reputation, methods, and vulnerabilities: <em>Respected but Overstretched</em>, <em>Paranoid</em>,
        <em>Brutal Efficiency</em>, <em>Old Obligations</em>. These Tags help you improvise DC adjustments,
        Edge or Burden, and likely reactions when the PCs put pressure on the faction or ask for help.
      </p>

      <h3 id="faction-relationships-and-maps">Faction Relationships and Maps</h3>
      <p>
        Factions rarely exist in isolation. The tensions between them, and their ties to the PCs, are what turn
        fronts into living pressure rather than static background. It often helps to sketch a simple relationship
        map that shows who cooperates with whom, who is at odds, and who uses whom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Draw the main factions as names or symbols on a page and connect them with labeled lines: alliances, rivalries,
        grudges, debts. Add a few Tags to the relationships themselves—<em>Fraying Alliance</em>, <em>Uneasy Truce</em>,
        <em>Secret Patronage</em>. These notes remind you that not all conflicts are open and that a single change in
        the PCs’ favor can ripple across several fronts at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the campaign progresses, update this map. Cross out relationships that have ended. Add new lines when
        factions discover common cause or fresh grievances. When you are unsure how a faction might react to a
        development, glance at the map and ask which relationships are most threatened or most likely to shift.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fronts-as-moving-threats">Fronts as Moving Threats</h3>
      <p>
        A front is a bundle of related threats that move toward one or more grim outcomes. Each front is built from
        Clocks, Tags, and key NPCs or locations. As sessions pass, fronts advance and the world changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a front, write a short statement of what will happen if no one intervenes. This is the grim
        trajectory: “The docks fall under full corporate control,” “The cult completes its summoning,” “The river
        trade collapses and famine follows.” This statement is not a promise of what must happen; it is a warning
        about what will happen if the PCs and their allies do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, create one to three <strong>Clocks</strong> that describe phases of that outcome. Each Clock should
        have a clear name and a number of segments that matches its scope: small shifts might use four segments,
        while slow‑burn crises might stretch to eight. Attach <strong>Tags</strong> that show how the front feels in
        play—<em>Tightening Security</em>, <em>Rising Tension</em>, <em>Fragile Peace</em>, <em>Rumors of War</em>.
        Finally, list a few NPCs, locations, or factions most closely tied to the front so you know where it is
        most visible in scenes.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Front</strong><br />
        <em>The River Trade War</em> – If unchecked, rival shipping houses will plunge the region into blockade and
        sabotage. Clocks: <em>Skirmishes Spread</em> (4‑segment), <em>Harbors Militarize</em> (6‑segment),
        <em>Civilian Trade Collapses</em> (8‑segment). Tags: <em>Rumors of War</em>, <em>Shortages</em>,
        <em>Strained Diplomacy</em>.
      </div>

      <h3 id="world-pressure-and-player-agency">World Pressure and Player Agency</h3>
      <p>
        Fronts and factions create pressure, but players still decide how and whether to respond. Use fronts to
        present problems, not to force outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advance fronts when time passes, when Clocks complete, or when characters ignore clear signs that a
        situation is getting worse. If the group spends several sessions focusing on one crisis, ask what is
        happening elsewhere and tick up a different Clock to show neglected pressures. Adjust fronts when players
        make bold moves, win allies, or change public opinion; a decisive victory might stall a Clock, split a
        front in two, or shift its Tags in the PCs’ favor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Retire fronts that have been fully resolved or transformed by play. When a front ends, replace it with one
        or more new fronts that reflect the consequences of that resolution. The end of a trade war might lead to a
        front about rebuilding trust, or to a power vacuum that invites new factions into the region. This cycle of
        rising and falling pressure keeps the world feeling alive and responsive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you advance a front, show it in the fiction: new Tags on locations, changed NPC attitudes, or visible
        shortages and unrest.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Keep Fronts on the Table</strong><br />
        Share the existence of major fronts with the players, even if some details remain hidden. This helps them
        choose where to focus and makes the world feel responsive to their actions.
      </div>

      <h3 id="using-fronts-in-sessions">Using Fronts in Sessions</h3>
      <p>
        Fronts do their best work when they are visible in everyday scenes, not just when a Clock fills. When you
        frame a session (see Chapter 21), glance at your list of fronts and ask which ones are most likely to show
        up tonight. Then look for ways to express them through Tags, NPC behavior, and opportunities or obstacles
        the PCs encounter.
      </p>
      <p>
        During play, advance a front’s Clock when an event clearly moves it forward—whether or not the PCs were
        directly involved. A failed negotiation might tick up <em>Harbors Militarize</em>, while a successful rally
        could slow it down or add a hopeful Tag to the docks. When a front remains quiet for several sessions,
        decide whether it is truly dormant or whether it is building toward a sharper pivot you can reveal in a
        future scene.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fronts-and-vpcs">Fronts, VPCs, and the Party</h3>
      <p>
        Virtual Player Characters (VPCs) from Chapter 24 are natural hooks into your fronts. A VPC might belong to a
        faction, carry a Tag associated with a front, or have a personal Clock that mirrors a larger pressure. When
        the group advances or resolves a front, consider how their VPC companions feel it: changes in their home
        neighborhood, promotions or demotions, new Conditions that reflect stress or hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        In solo or small‑party play, you can use VPC‑tied fronts to keep the world grounded around the protagonist.
        A VPC whose family is caught in a housing dispute, or whose union is under threat, creates constant reasons
        for the main character to care about broader pressures. When the front changes, the VPC’s Tags and behavior
        change too, reminding the player that their actions shape not just the map but the people travelling beside
        them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-26-alternative-play">
      <h2 id="alternative-play-heading">26. Alternative Play</h2>

      <p>
        While the game is written with a Game Master in mind, you can also play without a single GM or with shared
        authority. You can even combine shared authority with solo or small‑party play by leaning on Virtual Player
        Characters (VPCs) from Chapter 24. This chapter offers principles and procedures for those modes while
        keeping the core 4d6 system, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks intact.
      </p>

      <h3 id="principles-of-shared-authority">Principles of Shared Authority</h3>
      <p>
        In GMless or shared authority play, the table distributes responsibilities that a single GM would normally
        carry. To keep the game coherent and fair, begin by clarifying roles. Decide who tracks Clocks, who keeps an
        eye on rules, and who speaks for which factions or major NPCs. These assignments can rotate, but everyone
        should know who is doing what in the current session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use open, shared notes for Tags, fronts, and outstanding questions. A simple shared document or visible
        sheet on the table helps everyone remember which fronts are active, which Clocks are close to completion,
        and what loose ends still matter. Favor transparency: make DCs, Clocks, and major fronts visible to
        everyone, so the group can judge risks and consequences together.
      </p>

      <h3 id="rotating-facilitator">Rotating Facilitator</h3>
      <p>
        One simple form of shared authority is the rotating facilitator. Each session, one player takes on a light
        GM role: framing scenes, presenting problems, and helping adjudicate rules. Other players still contribute
        ideas and may take over certain responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rotate the facilitator role regularly—every session or every arc—so no one person carries the job all the
        time. Let the facilitator focus on big‑picture framing and pacing while others handle certain NPCs or
        factions. In these modes, safety tools and calibration from Chapter 20 become even more important, because
        everyone shares some part of the authority that a single GM would normally hold.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Rotating Facilitator</strong><br />
        In a political drama campaign, each player takes a turn framing sessions about their character’s home
        faction. When it is your turn, you introduce new complications for your faction and ask questions about how
        others respond, but everyone shares in describing outcomes and consequences.
      </div>

      <h3 id="gmless-procedures">GMless Procedures</h3>
      <p>
        Fully GMless play works best when procedures are explicit. Agree on how you will introduce threats, decide
        outcomes, and keep the fiction coherent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many groups like to use a simple turn structure for scene framing. On your turn, you frame a scene, invite
        others to act, and help adjudicate any Checks that arise. When a question about the world comes up and no
        one has a strong opinion, discuss briefly and then choose the most interesting answer that still respects
        established Tags and fronts. If you are still unsure, or you want to surprise yourselves, use oracles or
        random tables (such as “Yes/No/Complication” prompts) to resolve uncertain world questions.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>Shared Authority Note</strong><br />
        Even without a GM, someone should still be responsible for tracking Clocks, Tags, and Conditions. You can
        rotate this role or assign it to the player most excited about rules support.
      </div>
      <h3 id="solo-play-with-vpcs">Solo Play with VPC Companions</h3>
      <p>
        Solo play focuses on a single protagonist and your own choices as both player and facilitator. VPCs make
        solo play feel like a full party game by adding mechanical support and in‑fiction companions without taking
        control away from you. This section provides a framework for using the core system to tell solo stories with
        VPCs while preserving uncertainty and surprise.
      </p>

      <h4 id="solo-play-principles">Solo Play Principles</h4>
      <p>
        Solo play emphasizes introspection, discovery, and personal pacing. You decide when to zoom in on a moment
        and when to jump ahead. The same fiction‑first structure applies: establish the situation and what your
        character wants, ask whether the outcome is uncertain and meaningful, and call for Checks only when both are
        true. VPCs travel alongside you, but they react to your choices rather than driving the story themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        When building a solo party, create one or two VPCs that clearly cover gaps in your own character’s Skills
        and Proficiencies. If you are playing a social investigator, you might add a physically capable VPC and a
        technical expert. Keep their concepts simple and their motivations aligned with yours so that you are never
        debating against yourself about what the group “should” do.
      </p>

      <h4 id="using-oracles-and-prompts">Using Oracles and Prompts</h4>
      <p>
        Without another person at the table, you can use oracles, random tables, or written prompts to stand in for
        a GM. These tools answer questions about how the world responds to your actions and those of your VPC
        companions. When you do not know how an NPC reacts or whether a rumor is true, roll on a simple
        “Yes / No / Complication” oracle and interpret the result in light of existing Tags and Clocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also create short tables for genre‑specific twists—mysterious clues, faction moves, strange weather,
        uncanny phenomena. Clocks are especially useful in solo play for tracking longer mysteries or threats that
        evolve regardless of your immediate focus. When you spend several scenes on personal matters or travel,
        advance a relevant Clock to show how the wider world is changing in your absence.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Solo Oracle</strong><br />
        You wonder if the abandoned station still has power. You decide the base chance is “unlikely.” You roll on a
        small oracle table and get “Yes, but…”. The lights flicker on (Tag: <em>Unstable Power</em>), but a
        <em>Security Systems Wake</em> Clock also starts at 1 of 6. Your VPC companion, a cautious engineer, urges
        you to move quickly before systems cycle fully online.
      </div>

      <h4 id="journaling-and-record-keeping">Journaling and Record‑Keeping</h4>
      <p>
        Keeping a record of solo play makes it easier to track Tags, Conditions, and Clocks over many sessions.
        You can use the Session Log and Advancement Tracker sheets from Chapter 28 or your own journal. Briefly note
        each scene, any Checks that mattered, and how VPCs contributed so that their growth feels consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between sessions, update Clocks, fronts, and important Tags as they change. Mark down questions you want to
        explore next time: unresolved clues, VPC worries, or threads you are curious about. Solo play benefits from
        this written memory, especially when you are juggling both protagonist and facilitator roles.
      </p>

      <h4 id="bringing-solo-stories-to-the-table">Bringing Solo Stories to the Table</h4>
      <p>
        Solo play can exist alongside group play. You might explore a character’s side journeys alone, travelling
        with one or two VPCs, and then rejoin a group campaign later. When you do, share a summary of solo events
        with the group and the GM, and translate key outcomes into Tags, Conditions, and advancement choices that
        everyone can see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work with the GM and the rest of the table to integrate any new fronts, NPCs, or VPC developments that
        emerged from solo sessions. This keeps the whole campaign consistent while honoring the personal stories you
        told on your own, and it lets your VPC companions feel like part of the shared world instead of isolated
        side characters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sheets and play aids translate the structure of this rulebook into tools you can put on the table. They help

      <h3 id="player-facing-sheets">Player‑Facing Sheets</h3>
      <p>
        Player‑facing sheets focus on characters and their immediate perspective. At minimum, most campaigns benefit
        from three, which are provided as templates in <code>source/codex/sheets/</code>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Core Character Sheet</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_character_sheet.md</code>): Tracks identity,
          Attributes (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN), Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, personal Clocks, gear, and
          key relationships. It leaves space for narrative details (goals, secrets, threads) alongside mechanics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advancement &amp; Threads Tracker</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_advancement_tracker.md</code>):
          A place to note personal goals, unresolved hooks, Downtime projects, and advancement choices from
          Chapter 19.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Session Log</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_session_log.md</code>): A one‑page log to track current
          objectives, important clues, memorable moments, and changing Tags, Conditions, and Clocks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you build or adapt a character sheet, favor clarity over density. Group related information together:
        core stats near Skills, Proficiencies near background and role, current Conditions near Tags and Clocks.
        Consider a dedicated area for “fiction first” notes—things your character believes, fears, or wants.
      </p>

      <h3 id="gm-facing-sheets">GM‑Facing Sheets</h3>
      <p>
        GM sheets support prep and improvisation. They help you track fronts, factions, NPCs, and open questions
        without rewriting the entire rulebook each time. Common GM‑facing sheets in <code>source/codex/sheets/</code> include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>GM Session Prep Worksheet</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_gm_session_prep.md</code>): A page for
          today’s session: key questions, opening situation, important NPCs, Clocks you expect to see, and Tags
          that define major locations or scenes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Campaign &amp; Fronts Sheet</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_campaign_fronts_sheet.md</code>): Tracks
          long‑term threats, factions, fronts, and the Clocks that represent their plans. It pairs naturally with
          Tags such as <em>Under Pressure</em>, <em>In Decline</em>, or <em>On the Rise</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>NPC and VPC Profiles</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_npc_vpc_profile.md</code>): Short templates for
          recurring characters, including their role, core motivation, Tags (for example, <em>Charming</em>,
          <em>Overworked</em>, <em>Ruthless</em>), and any Conditions or Clocks tied to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mystery or Scenario Frameworks:</strong> Grids or mind‑maps for investigations, intrigue, or
          multi‑step scenarios showing connections between locations, clues, and factions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use GM sheets as living documents. Cross out, annotate, and redraw as the campaign changes. If a front or
        faction no longer matters, retire its sheet and create a new one for the pressures that now define your
        world.
      </p>

      <h3 id="mechanical-reference-sheets">Mechanical Reference Sheets</h3>
      <p>
        Mechanical reference sheets condense rules you use frequently into quick‑look tables. They should never
        replace the chapter text, but they can reduce page‑flipping during intense scenes. Useful references in
        <code>source/codex/sheets/</code> include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DC Ladder &amp; Outcome Tiers</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_reference_dc_tiers.md</code>): A table showing DC 12–22 with examples, plus the margin bands for Critical, Full, Partial, Failure, and Critical Failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Tags &amp; Conditions Quick Lookup</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_reference_tags_conditions.md</code>): A subset of the most common entries from Chapter 18 for fast use.</li>
        <li><strong>Clock Templates</strong> (<code>core_rulebook_reference_clocks_templates.md</code>): Blank 4/6/8 segment Clocks you can photocopy or redraw as needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many groups like to keep these references at the center of the table or on a shared digital board so that
        everyone can see how consequences and odds are being judged.
      </p>

      <h3 id="using-legacy-sheets">Using and Adapting Existing Sheets</h3>
      <p>
        If you are working from earlier editions or companion books, you may already have a library of sheets:
        character templates, GM prep forms, encounter planners, and more. Most of them can be adapted to this Core
        Rulebook with minimal changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Replace older stat or dice assumptions with the 4d6 system, DC ladder, and outcome tiers described in Part I.</li>
        <li>Update any references to superseded mechanics (for example, outdated stress or tier systems) to use Tags, Conditions, and Clocks instead.</li>
        <li>Align Skill and Proficiency fields with the open lists and examples in Chapters 14–17.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When in doubt, treat existing sheets as prototypes. Copy the layout you like, then relabel sections so that
        they match the language and structure of this book.
      </p>

      <h3 id="building-your-own-sheets">Building Your Own Sheets</h3>
      <p>
        The best sheets are the ones you actually use. As your campaign develops, you may discover that you need a
        new kind of tracker—a heist staging sheet, a travel log, a faction treaty tracker. When you design a new
        sheet:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start from the questions you need to answer at the table (“Who is angry with us?”, “What do we owe?”).</li>
        <li>Give each sheet a clear purpose and a small number of sections.</li>
        <li>Include space for Tags, Conditions, and Clocks where they naturally apply.</li>
        <li>Label any connections to chapters (for example, “See Chapter 9 for Tag guidance”).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You do not need to formalize every idea into a sheet. A simple half‑page sketch can carry an arc of play.
        When a sheet keeps getting reused or recopied, consider turning it into a clean template for your group.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Campaign Dashboard</strong><br />
        One group creates a “campaign dashboard” sheet with three columns: Fronts (and their Clocks), Factions
        (and their current Tags), and Characters (with one or two key Conditions or edges each). At the start of
        every session, they update this sheet together. It becomes a shared map of pressures and opportunities that
        keeps everyone oriented without needing to reread every note.
      </div>

      <h3 id="printable-sheet-layouts">Printable Sheet Layouts</h3>
      <p>
        The following layouts mirror the sheet templates in <code>source/codex/sheets/</code> so you can print them
        directly from this rulebook. You can also treat them as visual references when building digital versions.

        <h2 id="inspirations-section-heading">Inspirations</h2>
        <p>Razorweave draws inspiration from the broader tradition of tabletop roleplaying games while implementing its own unique systems and setting. The following games and design movements influenced our thinking during development:</p>

        <h3>Modern RPG Design Philosophy</h3>

        <h4>Fiction-First Design</h4>
        <p>The principle that narrative positioning and fictional context should drive mechanical resolution was shaped by observing many modern indie RPGs. We appreciate how games like <em>Apocalypse World</em>, <em>Blades in the Dark</em>, and <em>Fate</em> prioritize the story over pure mechanics.</p>

        <h4>Streamlined Core Mechanics</h4>
        <p>The trend toward elegant, unified resolution systems (rather than separate subsystems for every action) influenced our 4d6+modifier approach. Games that demonstrated you don't need dozens of different mechanics to create depth showed us a better path.</p>

        <h4>Shared Narrative Authority</h4>
        <p>The idea that players and GMs collaborate to build the story together—rather than the GM being the sole arbiter—can be seen across many successful modern games. We wanted Razorweave to embrace this collaborative spirit.</p>

        <h3>Specific Mechanical Influences</h3>

        <h4>Graduated Success</h4>
        <p>The concept of "success with cost" (our Partial Success) appears in many games dating back to early indie RPGs. Rather than binary pass/fail, graduated outcomes create richer stories. We implemented this through our margin-based system with five distinct outcome tiers.</p>

        <h4>Progress Tracking</h4>
        <p>The idea of segmented trackers to represent ongoing threats, projects, or conflicts has become common across many indie games. Our Clock system uses this proven concept while implementing it in our own way (4/6/8 segments, specific advancement rules).</p>

        <h4>Advantageous Circumstances</h4>
        <p>Many games represent favorable or unfavorable situations through dice modification. We liked this concept and created our own implementation using Edge (+1/+2) and Burden (-1/-2) to modify the number of dice kept from a 4d6 roll.</p>

        <h4>Tags and Conditions</h4>
        <p>The practice of using short descriptors to track environment and character state appears across numerous modern games. We built on this common design pattern to create our own Tag and Condition systems.</p>

      <section id="design-principles" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="design-principles-heading">
        <h2 id="design-principles-heading">Design Principles We Embraced</h2>
        <p>Rather than copying specific mechanics, we internalized these broader principles:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Mechanics should serve the fiction</strong> - Rules exist to support the story, not the other way around.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep the math simple</strong> - Players should spend time roleplaying, not calculating.</li>
          <li><strong>Make consequences interesting</strong> - Failure should complicate the story, not stop it.</li>
          <li><strong>Trust the players</strong> - Give them meaningful choices and respect their creativity.</li>
          <li><strong>Fiction-first, always</strong> - When rules and fiction conflict, fiction wins.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="unique-heading">What Makes Razorweave Unique</h2>
        <p>While inspired by the broader tradition of indie RPGs, Razorweave has its own identity:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>4d6 margin-based resolution</strong> - Our core mechanic is our own design, not borrowed from another game</li>
          <li><strong>Edge/Burden system</strong> - Our implementation of advantageous circumstances uses unique terminology and dice mechanics</li>
          <li><strong>Four Attributes</strong> - Might, Agility, Presence, and Reason are our own attribute framework</li>
          <li><strong>Skills that flex</strong> - The same skill can pair with different attributes based on approach</li>
          <li><strong>Setting-agnostic with strong flavor</strong> - While examples use telegraph/relay technology, the rules work for any genre</li>
          <li><strong>Original progression system</strong> - Character advancement through milestone-based growth</li>
          <li><strong>Risk and Impact</strong> - Our framework for assessing danger and effect in situations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="version-history-heading">Version History</h2>
        <p>Maintaining a clear version history demonstrates independent development:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Git repository tracks all changes from initial concept through publication</li>
          <li>Commit history shows iterative design and refinement</li>
          <li>All development is documented and traceable</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This transparency proves Razorweave was independently created, not derived from proprietary sources.</p>
