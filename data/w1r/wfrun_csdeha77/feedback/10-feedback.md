## Pacing/Flow
- [ ] No issues
- Reads as a series of lists. Especially at the beginning. Janky flow.
- Feels a bit repetitive.  Ideally the chapters are set up with quickplay options up front for people who want to hit the ground running, detailed sections expanding upon the rules and edge cases with examples and tables, worked examples at the end.
