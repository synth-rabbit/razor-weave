# Chapter 1 Feedback: Welcome to the Game

## Tone/Voice
- [ ] No issues
- Intro needs to have more character to it as it reads very bland.
- Intro needs to sell the game as it is the first thing people will read

## Clarity
- [ ] No issues
- We shouldn't be telling the players how many people are necessary. Most will be reading this solo the first time.
  - Ex. `4-6 players: One person is the Game Master (GM) who describes the world and plays supporting characters. The rest are players who create and control their own characters.`

## Consistency
- [ ] No issues
- This rolling guidance is wrong. So far as I can tell there isn't any edge or burden so it should just be the full 4 dice
  - Ex. `2. Keep the best 3: Drop the lowest die, add the remaining three together`
  - Ex. `Example: Tomas tries to climb a fence while guards chase him. The GM calls for an AGI Check, DC 12. Tomas rolls 4d6 and gets 3, 4, 5, 2. He drops the 2, adds 3+4+5=12, then adds his AGI 1 for a total of 13. That beats DC 12—he makes it over the fence!`
- We don't mention that edge and burden are capped at +2 and -2 and we don't mention how to handle +2 or -2
