## 2. Core Concepts at a Glance

Razorweave is built on a simple promise: the story matters more than the rules, but the rules make the story matter more. Dice create tension. Consequences create stakes. And the moments that stay with you emerge from a table that trusts each other to play honestly and push forward together.

This chapter introduces the core ideas that make the system work. Later chapters expand and refine them, but everything begins here. Return to these concepts whenever you need to recalibrate how the game should feel at the table.

### Fiction First

The story is always the starting point. Describe the situation. Describe what your character does. Only when the outcome is uncertain and meaningful do the dice come out. You never start with a rule and force the fiction to fit it.

This means most moments in play don't require rolls at all. A competent lockpick opens a simple lock. A strong character kicks down a rotten door. The rules step in when success isn't guaranteed and failure would change the story.

### Characters

Characters are the lens through which you experience the world. Four Attributes (Might, Agility, Presence, and Reason) define their core capabilities. Skills represent trained competencies. Proficiencies unlock specific actions or grant situational advantages.

But characters are more than numbers. They have histories that shaped them, goals that drive them, and connections to people and places that pull them into trouble. Character creation takes about fifteen minutes, but leaves room for depth to emerge through play.

### Checks and Outcomes

When the outcome matters and isn't certain, you make a Check: roll 4d6, add your Attribute, add +1 if you have a relevant Skill, and compare to a target number. The result falls into one of four tiers (critical success, full success, partial success, or failure), each pushing the story in a different direction.

Partial success is where the system shines. You got what you wanted, but something else changed. The lock opens, but you hear footsteps. The negotiation works, but you owe a favor. Every roll moves the story forward, even when things go wrong.

### Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

The game tracks state through simple, visible tools. **Tags** are short descriptors attached to scenes, locations, or situations (like *Dimly Lit*, *Hostile Crowd*, or *Crumbling Floor*) that the GM uses to set difficulty or grant Edge and Burden. **Conditions** are ongoing states on characters (*Wounded*, *Exhausted*, *Rattled*) that affect what they can do until addressed.

**Clocks** are segmented circles that track progress toward something: a guard patrol completing its route, a ritual nearing completion, a character's resolve wearing thin. When the clock fills, the thing happens. Clocks make time visible and give weight to every moment spent.

### Table Collaboration

Everyone at the table contributes to the story. The GM presents the world honestly, describing situations, playing NPCs, and calling for Checks when outcomes are uncertain. Players act through their characters with clear intent, describing what they do and why. The rules help everyone answer the same question: what happens next?

This isn't a game where the GM has a secret story and the players try to find it. The best moments come from genuine uncertainty, honest reactions, and the willingness to let the dice change your plans.
