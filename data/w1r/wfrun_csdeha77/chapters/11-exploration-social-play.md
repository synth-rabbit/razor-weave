## 11. Exploration and Social Play

Exploration and social play cover everything that happens outside of direct combat. Investigating crime
        scenes, navigating dangerous terrain, decoding signals, negotiating alliances, and reading a crowded
        room all use the same core mechanics—Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on discovery, choice,
        and momentum rather than immediate harm.

### Exploration Overview

In exploration scenes, the GM presents situations, spaces, and mysteries. Players describe what their
        characters do: search, travel, tinker, observe, or test. When uncertainty, consequence, and agency are
        present, a Check resolves whether the attempt reveals information, overcomes an obstacle, or creates a
        new problem.

Exploration is not “filler between fights.” It is where many campaigns decide their tone: cozy
        neighborhood investigations, tense horror crawls, sprawling journeys, or intricate political maneuvering.
        Treat exploration choices as meaningful as any combat decision.

### Investigation and Discovery

When investigating, start with a clear question: “What am I trying to learn?” Then describe how you
        pursue it. Examples:

- “I examine the desk for hidden compartments and false bottoms.”
- “I compare the shipping logs with telegraph records for discrepancies.”
- “I walk the perimeter, looking for unusual footprints or tool marks.”

The GM chooses an Attribute and any relevant Skills, sets a DC based on how well‑hidden or complex the
        information is, and calls for a Check if needed. On a Full Success, you get a clear answer or strong
        lead. On a Partial Success, you learn something useful but pay a cost—time passes, someone notices, or
        the clue is incomplete. On a Failure, you miss the key detail or trigger a complication.

Investigation often uses paired Clocks:

- **Progress Clocks** for goals such as "Identify the culprit," "Decode the pattern," or "Map the tunnels." Successful Checks tick these forward.
- **Pressure Clocks** for dangers such as "Guards return," "Evidence destroyed," or "Storm closes in." Partial successes and Failures may tick these.

> **Example**: The group investigates a sabotaged telegraph relay. The GM creates a 6-segment "Find the saboteur" Clock and a 4-segment "Relay shutdown" Clock. Each successful RSN-based Check (examining equipment, tracing messages, interviewing operators) advances the first. Certain Failures or time-consuming approaches tick the second. Which fills first determines whether the saboteur is exposed before the network goes dark.

> **GM Guidance**: Never let investigation stall completely. If players fail a Check, they should still learn something—just not the whole picture, or with a cost attached. "You find nothing" is rarely interesting. "You find traces of the saboteur, but they also find traces of you" keeps the story moving.

### Travel and Environmental Challenges

Journeys, hazardous terrain, and environmental puzzles are handled with the same principles:

- Define the route, obstacles, and stakes.
- Assign Tags to the environment (*Slick*, *Cramped*, *Hazardous*, *Obscured*).
- Use Checks and Clocks to track progress and risk.

Long journeys can be condensed into a handful of key scenes. Each scene presents a meaningful choice: push
        for speed at higher risk, detour for safety at the cost of time, or engage with an opportunity or threat
        the GM introduces along the way.

> **Example**: The group must cross a floodplain before the next storm. The GM tags the region as *Hazardous* and *Unstable* and creates a "Reach Higher Ground" Clock and a "Waters Rise" Clock. Each scene, the players choose approaches—careful scouting, constructing makeshift bridges, or pushing through quickly. RSN, MIG, or AGI Checks advance progress or risk. Fictional choices about camps, supplies, and routes matter as much as the dice.

#### Pacing Travel Scenes

Not every mile of a journey needs screen time. Zoom in on moments where choices matter and zoom out when travel is routine. A three-day ride through safe territory might be summarized in a sentence. A single afternoon crossing contested ground might take an entire session.

Consider these pacing options:

- **Montage**: Describe the journey in broad strokes, pausing only for one or two interesting encounters or decisions.
- **Point crawl**: Identify key locations along the route and play out each as a brief scene with a choice or Check.
- **Full exploration**: When the journey itself is the adventure, play out each leg with detailed environmental challenges, discoveries, and encounters.

> **GM Guidance**: Match travel pacing to stakes. A journey to save a dying ally should feel urgent—use tight Clocks and hard choices. A journey to explore unknown territory can breathe—let players describe what they see, ask questions about the world, and stumble onto unexpected opportunities.

### Social Interaction

Social scenes—persuasion, negotiation, deception, and reading people—use the same core loop:

1. Clarify what you want from the other party.
1. Describe your approach and how you present yourself.
1. GM sets DC and Tags for the scene (*Tense*, *Festive*, *Suspicious*, *Profit-Minded*).
1. Roll Checks and interpret outcome tiers as changes in trust, position, or opportunity.

Presence-based Skills often lead here, but other Attributes can matter. A Reasoned argument, a Might-backed display of capability, or an Agility-based demonstration can all shift attitudes when grounded in the fiction.

> **GM Guidance**: Let players roleplay conversations before calling for Checks. The Check resolves whether their approach works, not whether they said the right words. A player who struggles with improvisation can describe their character's demeanor and goals; the dice determine the NPC's response.

### Negotiation and Leverage

Effective negotiation starts with understanding what the other side values. Before making big offers, consider using Insight or similar approaches to read their priorities. Are they driven by profit, duty, fear, or reputation? Tags like *Profit-Minded*, *Honor-Bound*, or *Desperate* can help anchor these traits.

Once you know what matters to them:

- **Identify leverage** – information, access, protection, or resources that speak directly to their needs.
- **Frame your offer** – present your proposal in terms of their goals, not yours.
- **Use Clocks for complex deals** – "Deal Secured" or "Trust Established" can track multi-round negotiations.

> **Example**: The group negotiates safe passage with a gang leader tagged as *Ruthless* and *Profit-Minded*. Early rounds focus on proving value and reliability, filling a "Consider Their Offer" Clock. Later rounds solidify terms. Each Check can move the Clock forward or back, with Partial successes adding new demands or concessions. When the Clock completes, the leader commits to a course of action—ally, neutral, or rival.

### Deception and Reading People

Deception is high-risk and high-reward. Successful lies open doors; failed lies create enemies. Keep lies simple, grounded in partial truths, and aligned with visible facts when possible. The GM may grant Edge when your story matches what NPCs can already see or believe.

Reading people through Insight or similar approaches lets you detect lies, gauge mood, and identify pressure points. On Full Success, the GM can tell you what an NPC most wants right now or what they are afraid will happen. On Partial Success, you get a rough sense with some uncertainty or risk being noticed.

> **Example**: A smuggler is captured in a quiet back room. First, intimidation fails to crack his loyalty, but ticks a Pressure Clock as his crew starts wondering where he is. Then the characters switch to deception, claiming his boss has already betrayed him. A contested Check between the character's PRE-based deception and the smuggler's Insight decides whether he believes the story. The outcome determines whether he reveals the shipment's location or shuts down entirely.

### Structuring Scenes with Clocks

Clocks are especially valuable in exploration and social play, where many small actions add up to big
        changes. Use them to:

- Track layered goals (investigation, preparation, influence).
- Represent background events (faction plans, approaching deadlines).
- Create tension in otherwise open‑ended situations.

In many campaigns, the most memorable scenes are not single Checks but sequences where Clocks visibly
        advance, threats close in, and players make hard choices about which fronts to address first.

### Tying Exploration and Social Back to Combat

Exploration and social play are not separate from combat—they shape it. Successfully mapping a site,
        securing allies, or learning an enemy’s habits can create Tags, Clocks, or Edges that pay off
        immediately when blades are drawn. Likewise, the outcome of a fight often creates new questions to
        investigate or relationships to repair.

When planning sessions, think in arcs: exploration reveals opportunities and risks, social play navigates them, and combat resolves the moments where words and careful planning are no longer enough. Then the story returns to exploration and social play, changed by what happened in the heat of the moment.

### Chapter Summary

Exploration and social play use the same core mechanics as combat—Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—but focus on discovery, choice, and influence rather than immediate harm.

**Investigation** starts with a clear question and uses paired Progress and Pressure Clocks to track breakthroughs against mounting danger. Never let failure stall the story; let it complicate the path forward.

**Travel** can be compressed or expanded based on stakes. Use environmental Tags, Clocks, and meaningful choices to make journeys matter. Match pacing to urgency: montage for routine travel, full exploration for perilous crossings.

**Social interaction** follows the same Check loop: clarify intent, describe approach, set DC, and interpret outcomes as shifts in trust and position. Players describe goals and demeanor; dice resolve NPC reactions. Different Attributes can apply depending on the fictional approach.

**Negotiation** benefits from reading the other party first. Identify what they value, then frame your offer in their terms. Use Clocks for complex multi-round deals.

**Deception** is high-risk, high-reward. Ground lies in partial truths. Reading people reveals priorities and fears.

All three modes connect: exploration reveals what's possible, social play shapes alliances and opposition, and combat resolves moments where words fail. The cycle then repeats, with new questions and relationships emerging from each confrontation.
