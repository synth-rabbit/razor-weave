## 19. Advancement and Long Term Growth

Characters in this game are meant to change. Advancement is how you show that change on the sheet. Over
        time, characters deepen their existing strengths, grow in new directions, shift relationships, and leave
        marks on the world. This chapter explains how advancement works mechanically, how to pace it, and how to
        use long‑term growth to reinforce the stories you want to tell.

### Advancement Philosophy

Advancement is not just power escalation. It is about **commitment and consequence**. When a
        character advances, you are answering questions like:

- What have they practiced enough that it now comes easily?
- Which relationships or responsibilities have deepened into Proficiencies?
- Where has the world left marks that will not simply fade away?

The system assumes a steady but flexible pace. Groups that play short campaigns can focus on a few big
        milestones. Long‑running tables can layer many smaller adjustments over time. In both cases, advancement
        should feel earned and should point toward new decisions, not just add flat bonuses.

### When Advancement Happens

There are three main advancement triggers. You can use one of them as your default, or blend them as fits
        your table:

- **Session‑Based Advancement:**Every few sessions (for example, every 3–4), the group
          reviews what has changed and grants a small advancement. This is simple to track and works well for
          episodic play.
- **Milestone Advancement:**Advancement occurs when characters resolve significant goals:
          completing an arc, changing a faction’s status, overcoming a major front, or achieving a personal
          breakthrough.
- **Downtime Advancement:**Certain Downtime activities (Chapter 12) explicitly unlock
          new options—study, training, research, or community work that, when completed, grant advancements.

You do not need a separate experience point currency unless your table enjoys tracking it. For most
        campaigns, a combination of session review and clear milestones is enough to keep growth steady and
        meaningful.

> **GM Guidance – Pace, Not Payment**
Think of advancement as pacing, not as a reward to withhold or grant as punishment. If your group is
>         engaged, taking risks, and pushing the story forward, advancement should follow. Use it to signal
>         chapters in the campaign, not to score performance.

### Pacing Reference Table

The following table provides reference benchmarks for different campaign lengths. These are guidelines, not
        rigid requirements—adjust freely to match your table's preferences and story rhythm.

| Campaign Length | Total Sessions | Advancements per Character | Attribute Increases | Typical Milestone Interval |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Short** (single arc) | 6–10 sessions | 2–4 advancements | 0–1 Attribute | Every 2–3 sessions |
| **Medium** (multiple arcs) | 12–24 sessions | 5–10 advancements | 1–3 Attributes | Every 3–4 sessions |
| **Long** (ongoing campaign) | 25+ sessions | 10–20+ advancements | 2–5 Attributes | Every 4–5 sessions |

**Notes on the table:**

- **Advancements per Character:**Includes all choices from the Advancement Menu—Skills,
          Proficiencies, relationships, Attributes, etc.
- **Attribute Increases:**These are rarer and mark major transformations. Most characters
          will advance Skills and Proficiencies far more frequently.
- **Milestone Interval:**Use story beats as primary markers. Session counts here reflect
          typical pacing when milestones align with arc resolution.

### Calibration Examples

These concrete scenarios illustrate how advancement pacing might work in practice.

**Example 1 – Weekly Play, Medium Campaign**

A group plays weekly for six months (approximately 20 sessions). They use milestone advancement tied to
        arc completion. Over this period:

- The campaign includes 4 major arcs (each 4–6 sessions).
- Characters receive 1 advancement per arc completion, plus 1 mid‑arc advancement when a significant subplot resolves.
- Total: **6–8 advancements per character** over 20 sessions.
- Attribute increases occur at the end of arcs 2 and 4, reflecting transformational events (total: **2 Attribute increases**).
- Most advancements focus on new Skills, deepened Proficiencies, and relationship changes.

**Example 2 – Biweekly Play, Grounded Tone**

A group plays every other week, prioritizing a slower, more grounded campaign. They meet for 15 sessions
        over eight months:

- Advancement occurs every 4–5 sessions, tied to completing investigation arcs or major faction shifts.
- Total: **3–4 advancements per character**.
- Attribute increases are extremely rare (perhaps **0–1 over the entire campaign**).
- Growth focuses on Skill refinement, Proficiency deepening, and acquiring new contacts or resources.
- This keeps characters feeling human‑scale while still showing meaningful change.

**Example 3 – Monthly Play, Heroic Arc**

A group meets monthly for a high‑stakes, heroic campaign spanning 12 sessions over a year:

- Advancement happens every 2–3 sessions, reflecting rapid escalation and dramatic milestones.
- Total: **5–6 advancements per character**.
- Attribute increases occur more frequently (**2–3 over the campaign**), tied to pivotal moments (for example, surviving a supernatural ordeal, completing intense training).
- Proficiencies and Skills expand quickly to match the larger‑than‑life scope of challenges.

### Adjusting Pacing for Play Style

Different groups need different rhythms. Use these guidelines to calibrate advancement for your table's
        preferences:

**For Faster Advancement (Heroic, High‑Fantasy, or Short Campaigns):**

- Grant advancements every 2–3 sessions or at the end of every major scene.
- Allow Attribute increases more liberally (every 3–4 advancements).
- Focus on mechanical growth—new abilities, expanded fictional permissions, Tags that create advantages.
- Use advancement to signal power escalation and keep pace with rising stakes.

**For Slower Advancement (Grounded, Investigative, or Long Campaigns):**

- Grant advancements every 4–6 sessions or only at major story milestones.
- Reserve Attribute increases for transformational moments (training montages, life‑changing events).
- Emphasize Skill deepening and Proficiency refinement over adding new options.
- Let characters grow through relationships, reputation, and narrative authority more than raw mechanical bonuses.

**For Variable Pacing (Mixed Tone, Episodic Play):**

- Use session‑based advancement (every 3–4 sessions) as a baseline, with bonus advancements for major milestones.
- Allow players to choose how they want to grow—some may focus on Attributes, others on relationships or Proficiencies.
- Adjust the Advancement Menu per arc: offer Attribute increases only during transformational arcs, but always allow Skill and Proficiency changes.
- Check in with your table every few sessions to confirm the pacing feels right.

### Advancement Menu

When an advancement trigger occurs, each character chooses one option from the menu below (or a smaller
        subset agreed upon for the current arc). You can mix and match over time—one advancement might improve an
        Attribute, another might add a Skill, another might unlock a new Proficiency.

- **Attribute Growth:**Raise one Attribute by +1 (up to the table’s agreed cap).
- **New Skill:**Add a new Skill that fits recent experiences or campaign needs.
- **Skill Deepening:**Sharpen an existing Skill by broadening its examples and fictional reach.
- **New Proficiency:**Gain a new Proficiency that reflects training, role change, or earned authority.
- **Proficiency Deepening:**Expand the scope or impact of a Proficiency you already have.
- **Relationship & Reputation:**Formalize a new bond, contact, or standing as a trackable element.
- **Tag/Condition Edge:**Establish a recurring beneficial Condition or signature Tag you can invoke.

You can also define campaign‑specific options—unlocking access to certain playbooks, factions, or gear
        packages once certain arcs complete. Keep the menu small at first and grow it as your table discovers what
        feels fun.

### Attribute Advancement

Attributes (MIG, AGI, PRE, WIL) measure broad tendencies. Increasing an Attribute means you have changed in
        a visible way: stronger, quicker, more confident, or more insightful. Attribute growth is **slow and
        rare** compared to Skill or Proficiency changes.

- By default, a character might gain +1 to an Attribute only a few times in an entire campaign.
- Attribute increases should be tied to major milestones—training arcs, transformational events, or long‑term practice.
- Consider setting a soft cap (for example, “most characters will not exceed +3 in an Attribute without special circumstances”).

When you raise an Attribute, revisit examples in Chapter 7. How does a character with this new rating
        behave differently? Let the fiction catch up: show new capabilities, confidence, or habits before you lean
        on the bonus mechanically.

### Skill Advancement

Skills represent practiced competencies. They will change more often than Attributes. When a character
        consistently uses a particular approach, or spends Downtime deliberately training, it is natural that new
        Skills appear or existing ones deepen.

Typical Skill advancements include:

- **Adding a new Skill**that fits recent events (learning Forensics after a long investigation arc).
- **Refining an existing Skill**by expanding its examples or categories (Tinkering now clearly covers specific devices or domains).
- **Linking Skills to new Attributes** as the character learns alternate approaches (using Streetwise with WIL after a period of careful study, not just PRE improvisation).

Advancement does not need to be numeric to matter. Sometimes, the best Skill advancement is updating its
        description in your notes to match what the character has actually done—then letting that broader scope
        justify Edge or new fictional permissions in future scenes.

> **Example – Skill Advancement Through Play**
Over several arcs, a PC repeatedly uses Systems & Diagnostics not just on machines but on social
>         systems—modeling faction responses and predicting policy fallout. When an advancement trigger hits, the
>         table agrees that this Skill now explicitly covers “social modeling” as part of its description. Future
>         Checks in that niche may receive Edge or lower DCs, reflecting that lived experience.

### Proficiency Advancement

Proficiencies (Chapter 16 and 17) represent domain expertise and narrative permission. They are a natural
        place to focus long‑term growth. Advancing a Proficiency usually means one of two things:

- **Broadening scope:**Your expertise applies in more places or to more situations.
- **Deepening impact:**Within its existing scope, your Proficiency changes the fiction more strongly.

Examples:

- Harbor Operations broadens from one city to the entire coastal region.
- Community Organizing deepens so that movements you start are harder to suppress and better at resisting backlash.
- Cold‑Case Records broadens to cover not just police archives but independent and underground records.

When a Proficiency advances, talk through concrete fictional changes first—new contacts, credentials, or
        responsibilities—then decide how often it will justify Edge, reduced DCs, or automatic success for
        routine tasks in its expanded area.

### Milestones, Arcs, and Growth

Milestones are story beats where something about the world or the characters is clearly different than
        before. Use them as anchors for advancement decisions. Ask, at the end of an arc:

- What did we learn or change?
- Which abilities were central to this arc?
- Which relationships or responsibilities feel different now?

Advancement choices should follow those answers. If an arc centered on a labor dispute, Proficiencies like
        Union Stewardship or Community Organizing are natural candidates for growth. If an arc focused on strange
        artifacts, Lore & Analysis or Occult Librarianship might advance.

> **Example – Milestone Advancement**
After resolving a long‑running conflict between harbor workers and a shipping consortium, the group reaches
>         a milestone. One PC chooses to broaden their Community Organizing Proficiency to explicitly cover “Port‑Wide
>         Coalition Building.” Another adds a new Skill, Negotiation Structures, based on months of haggling. A third,
>         who spent much of the arc hauling crates and repairing docks, takes a +1 to MIG, reflecting a more physically
>         demanding life.

### Downtime and Advancement

Downtime (Chapter 12) is an ideal place to handle training, research, and recovery. You can tie specific
        Downtime projects to future advancements:

- A training project might, when completed, unlock a new Skill or Attribute increase.
- A research project might create or broaden a Proficiency (for example, Arcane Cartography).
- A community project might convert a recurring Tag (such as*Neglected District*) into a more favorable one.

Represent these projects with Clocks. When a Clock tied to training or study fills, it grants the planned
        advancement. This keeps progress visible and lets the group decide how much attention to invest in long‑term
        growth versus immediate problems.

### Gear, Resources, and Tags

Not all growth is on the character sheet. Over time, characters may:

- Secure access to better gear or facilities.
- Establish safehouses or workshops that carry Tags like*Well‑Equipped*or*Secure*.
- Gain ongoing support from factions, represented as beneficial Conditions or Proficiencies.

Treat these as shared advancements. When the group invests heavily in a home base, for example, note its
        Tags and how they affect future scenes (easier recovery, safer planning, more leverage in negotiations). As
        with individual growth, tie these upgrades to on‑screen effort and milestones rather than spontaneous
        appearances.

### Calibrating Pacing and Difficulty

As characters advance, their chances on many Checks improve. To keep tension, you can:

- Shift from simple DC 12–14 tasks toward more DC 16–18 challenges as campaigns deepen.
- Introduce broader stakes where success has bigger consequences and Partial Successes matter more.
- Use more Clocks and Tags rather than only raising DCs—strong characters change the shape of problems, not just the numbers.

If you want a slower‑growth, more grounded campaign, limit Attribute increases and focus advancement on new
        Skills, Proficiencies, and relationships. For more heroic arcs, allow more frequent Attribute growth and
        treat Legendary DCs (22) as reachable when characters stack favorable Tags, Proficiencies, and preparation.

> **GM Guidance – Advancement as Conversation**
Treat advancement decisions as a conversation at the table. Ask players what kinds of challenges they want
>         their characters to face next, then steer advancement choices and campaign prep toward those interests. The
>         goal is not to “balance” everyone identically but to make sure each character’s growth opens doors they are
>         excited to walk through.
