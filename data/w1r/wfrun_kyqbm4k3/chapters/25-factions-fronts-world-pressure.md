## 25. Factions, Fronts, and World Pressure

Factions and fronts are how you model large‑scale forces in the world: organizations, movements, disasters,
        conspiracies, and other pressures that evolve over time. This chapter shows how to turn them into clear,
        actionable tools for play.

### Defining Factions

A faction is any organized group with shared goals. Factions can be formal (guilds, corporations, orders) or
        informal (neighborhood networks, underground movements, families).

Start by defining the faction’s**name and identity**. What are they called, and how do they
        present themselves to the world? A workers’ council, a scientific enclave, an undercity syndicate, or a
        temple order all communicate tone and values through their names, symbols, and public rituals. Identity
        tells you how people talk about the faction and how its members recognize one another.

Clarify the faction’s**goals**: what they are trying to achieve in the short and long term. A
        neighborhood mutual aid group might want to keep families fed this month and eventually push back against
        predatory landlords. A corporate research division might want to hit quarterly milestones while secretly
        pursuing a disruptive breakthrough. Goals give you levers to pull when the PCs interact with the faction:
        what they will bargain for, what they will sacrifice, and what they will never willingly give up.

List the faction’s**resources**: people, tools, territory, secrets, and reputation. Resources
        explain why the faction matters. A group with few members but crucial information can be as powerful in play
        as a large guild with warehouses and security forces. Finally, assign two to four**Tags**that
        capture reputation, methods, and vulnerabilities:*Respected but Overstretched*,*Paranoid*,*Brutal Efficiency*,*Old Obligations*. These Tags help you improvise DC adjustments,
        Edge or Burden, and likely reactions when the PCs put pressure on the faction or ask for help.

### Faction Relationships and Maps

Factions rarely exist in isolation. The tensions between them, and their ties to the PCs, are what turn
        fronts into living pressure rather than static background. It often helps to sketch a simple relationship
        map that shows who cooperates with whom, who is at odds, and who uses whom.

Draw the main factions as names or symbols on a page and connect them with labeled lines: alliances, rivalries,
        grudges, debts. Add a few Tags to the relationships themselves—*Fraying Alliance*,*Uneasy Truce*,*Secret Patronage*. These notes remind you that not all conflicts are open and that a single change in
        the PCs’ favor can ripple across several fronts at once.

As the campaign progresses, update this map. Cross out relationships that have ended. Add new lines when
        factions discover common cause or fresh grievances. When you are unsure how a faction might react to a
        development, glance at the map and ask which relationships are most threatened or most likely to shift.

### Fronts as Moving Threats

A front is a bundle of related threats that move toward one or more grim outcomes. Each front is built from
        Clocks, Tags, and key NPCs or locations. As sessions pass, fronts advance and the world changes.

To create a front, write a short statement of what will happen if no one intervenes. This is the grim
        trajectory: “The docks fall under full corporate control,” “The cult completes its summoning,” “The river
        trade collapses and famine follows.” This statement is not a promise of what must happen; it is a warning
        about what will happen if the PCs and their allies do nothing.

Next, create one to three**Clocks**that describe phases of that outcome. Each Clock should
        have a clear name and a number of segments that matches its scope: small shifts might use four segments,
        while slow‑burn crises might stretch to eight. Attach**Tags**that show how the front feels in
        play—*Tightening Security*,*Rising Tension*,*Fragile Peace*,*Rumors of War*.
        Finally, list a few NPCs, locations, or factions most closely tied to the front so you know where it is
        most visible in scenes.

> **Example**
> **Example – Front**
*The River Trade War*– If unchecked, rival shipping houses will plunge the region into blockade and
>         sabotage. Clocks:*Skirmishes Spread*(4‑segment),*Harbors Militarize*(6‑segment),*Civilian Trade Collapses*(8‑segment). Tags:*Rumors of War*,*Shortages*,*Strained Diplomacy*.

### World Pressure and Player Agency

Fronts and factions create pressure, but players still decide how and whether to respond. Use fronts to
        present problems, not to force outcomes.

Advance fronts when time passes, when Clocks complete, or when characters ignore clear signs that a
        situation is getting worse. If the group spends several sessions focusing on one crisis, ask what is
        happening elsewhere and tick up a different Clock to show neglected pressures. Adjust fronts when players
        make bold moves, win allies, or change public opinion; a decisive victory might stall a Clock, split a
        front in two, or shift its Tags in the PCs’ favor.

Retire fronts that have been fully resolved or transformed by play. When a front ends, replace it with one
        or more new fronts that reflect the consequences of that resolution. The end of a trade war might lead to a
        front about rebuilding trust, or to a power vacuum that invites new factions into the region. This cycle of
        rising and falling pressure keeps the world feeling alive and responsive.

When you advance a front, show it in the fiction: new Tags on locations, changed NPC attitudes, or visible
        shortages and unrest.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Keep Fronts on the Table**
Share the existence of major fronts with the players, even if some details remain hidden. This helps them
>         choose where to focus and makes the world feel responsive to their actions.

### Using Fronts in Sessions

Fronts do their best work when they are visible in everyday scenes, not just when a Clock fills. When you
        frame a session (see Chapter 21), glance at your list of fronts and ask which ones are most likely to show
        up tonight. Then look for ways to express them through Tags, NPC behavior, and opportunities or obstacles
        the PCs encounter.

During play, advance a front’s Clock when an event clearly moves it forward—whether or not the PCs were
        directly involved. A failed negotiation might tick up*Harbors Militarize*, while a successful rally
        could slow it down or add a hopeful Tag to the docks. When a front remains quiet for several sessions,
        decide whether it is truly dormant or whether it is building toward a sharper pivot you can reveal in a
        future scene.

### Fronts, VPCs, and the Party

Virtual Player Characters (VPCs) from Chapter 24 are natural hooks into your fronts. A VPC might belong to a
        faction, carry a Tag associated with a front, or have a personal Clock that mirrors a larger pressure. When
        the group advances or resolves a front, consider how their VPC companions feel it: changes in their home
        neighborhood, promotions or demotions, new Conditions that reflect stress or hope.

In solo or small‑party play, you can use VPC‑tied fronts to keep the world grounded around the protagonist.
        A VPC whose family is caught in a housing dispute, or whose union is under threat, creates constant reasons
        for the main character to care about broader pressures. When the front changes, the VPC’s Tags and behavior
        change too, reminding the player that their actions shape not just the map but the people travelling beside
        them.
