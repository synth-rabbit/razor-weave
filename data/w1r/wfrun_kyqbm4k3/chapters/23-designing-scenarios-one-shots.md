## 23. Designing Scenarios and One Shots

This chapter focuses on designing concrete scenarios: specific problems, locations, and NPCs that players
        will confront. It also gives guidance for one‑shot play, where you have limited time and want a strong,
        self‑contained story.

### Scenario Design Principles

A good scenario is built on clear stakes, interesting choices, and pressures that escalate over time. It
        does not require a fixed plot. It needs a situation that cannot stay the same.

Begin by**defining the stakes**. Ask what happens if the characters succeed, fail, or walk
        away. Tie those outcomes to people, places, and values the group cares about: a neighborhood’s safety, a
        fragile peace treaty, a personal promise. When everyone understands what is on the line, even simple scenes
        feel charged.

Next,**identify the pressures**that make the situation unstable. Use Clocks and Tags to
        represent time limits, looming threats, and shifting opportunities. A “Festival Week” Tag might make a city
        more crowded and distract guards, while a “Bridge Sabotage” Clock ticks up as the villains move toward
        their goal.

Finally,**offer multiple approaches**. Design scenarios that reward different Skills and
        strategies: talking, sneaking, researching, fighting, or working through community networks. Players should
        be able to solve the problem in more than one way, and the system should support those choices through
        Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks.

### From Fronts to Individual Scenarios

Most campaigns in Razorweave are driven by fronts and factions (see Chapter 25). Scenarios are how you zoom
        in on one moment in that larger struggle. When you design a scenario, you are asking: “What does this front
        look like*today*, in this specific place, through these characters’ eyes?”

Choose one front that feels active and write a short summary of how it manifests in the immediate future.
        A “Corporate Crackdown” front might show up as surprise inspections at the docks, or a “Famine Looms”
        front might appear as ration lines and grain hoarding. That manifestation becomes the seed for your
        scenario; the wider front explains why events keep escalating even if the characters handle the problem in
        front of them.

Once you have that seed, connect it back to stakes and pressures. Decide who will be helped or harmed if
        nothing changes, then use Tags and Clocks to express that pressure in the scene. By keeping the scenario
        tightly connected to a front, you ensure that even one‑shot adventures still move the larger campaign
        forward.

### Building Blocks: Locations, NPCs, and Clocks

Most scenarios are built from a small set of locations and NPCs connected by clear pressures.

Create**locations**with two or three Tags and a few sensory details. A canal‑side tavern
        might be tagged*Smoky*,*Crowded*, and*Well‑Connected*, with descriptions of damp
        wood and low music. Think about how Checks at that location will interact with those Tags—who can hide in
        the crowd, who will be overheard, who might slip on the wet stone.

Give each important**NPC**a role, a clear desire, and one or two Tags that describe their
        posture or leverage. A clerk who wants to keep their job at any cost feels different from a bored guard
        looking for an excuse to talk, even if both are technically “obstacles.”

Attach**Clocks**to events that move regardless of player action: a storm arriving, a ritual
        completing, a patrol pattern cycling. These Clocks turn background details into active pressures that shape
        choices and give you a way to escalate tension without inventing new threats from nowhere.

> **Example – Scenario Building Blocks**
A heist scenario might include a*Guarded Vault*(Tags:*Surveillance*,*Hazardous*),
>         a suspicious clerk (Tags:*Nervous*,*Underpaid*), and a*Shift Change*Clock that
>         advances whenever time passes or noise is made.

### Information Flow and Clue Mapping

Investigative scenarios live or die on how information moves. In this system, core clues should be
        discoverable without high‑risk Checks. Rolls are for how quickly the group connects the dots, what extra
        context they pick up, and what complications emerge along the way.

When you design a mystery, list the key truths that players need in order to act—who is involved, what they
        want, where critical scenes might happen. Then place each truth in two or three different places: a
        location, an NPC, a document, a rumor. If players miss one entry point, another remains available. Checks
        gate how costly or noisy it is to get that information, not whether the information exists at all.

Clocks and Tags help you manage failure without stalling the story. A failed research Check might advance a
        “Rival Investigators Close In” Clock rather than erase a clue from the world. A Partial Success might reveal
        the right lead but add a*Watched by the Watch*Tag to the neighborhood. Information continues to
        flow, but the world grows more complicated in response.

### One‑Shot Structure

One‑shots compress the arc of setup, rising action, and resolution into a single session. To keep the pace
        satisfying, design with fewer locations, sharper stakes, and more visible Clocks.

Limit yourself to just a few major locations and a handful of key NPCs. You do not have time to explore an
        entire city; focus on the dockside warehouse, the gala ballroom, or the frontier outpost that matters
        tonight. Introduce the central problem quickly—ideally within the first fifteen to twenty minutes—so players
        can spend most of the session responding rather than orienting.

Use one or two big Clocks that everyone can see and feel advancing. “Storm Breaks Over the City,”
        “Inquisitors Close In,” or “The Train Reaches the Broken Bridge” give a constant sense of momentum. Be
        generous with information; players need enough clues and context to make strong choices quickly without
        feeling rushed or lost.

> **GM Guidance – Start In Motion**
For one‑shots, open in the middle of action: on the train as it approaches the bridge, in the courtroom as
>         testimony begins, at the threshold of the haunted facility. Ask a few clarifying questions, then let the
>         situation unfold.

### Multi‑Session Scenarios

Some scenarios are large enough to span several sessions without becoming full campaigns on their own. A
        three‑part heist, a long voyage with multiple ports of call, or a festival week with brewing unrest can all
        be treated as multi‑session scenarios. The key is to break them into phases, each with its own stakes and
        Clocks, while keeping a clear through‑line.

A common structure is “setup, escalation, resolution.” In the setup phase, characters gather information,
        build relationships, and position themselves. In the escalation phase, fronts push back, Clocks advance, and
        difficult choices close some paths while opening others. In the resolution phase, the biggest Clocks fill or
        are averted, and the world changes in a visible way. Each phase can roughly map to one or two sessions,
        depending on how your table likes to play.

At the end of each phase, take a moment to adjust Tags and Clocks. A neighborhood might shift from*Tense*to*On Edge*, or a faction might gain the edge Condition*Emboldened Supporters*.
        These adjustments remind everyone that the scenario is moving forward, even if the final confrontation has
        not yet happened.

### Genre Variants for Scenarios

The same structural tools—stakes, Tags, Conditions, Clocks—behave differently across genres. When you
        design scenarios, let your chosen slice (cozy, fantasy, horror/mystery, modern, sci‑fi) shape how pressure
        feels and what “failure” looks like.

In a**cozy**scenario, Clocks might track emotional distance, community events, or looming
        misunderstandings rather than physical danger. A “Harvest Fair” scenario could revolve around saving a
        beloved tradition from bureaucratic neglect, with Tags like*Warm Lanterns*and*Thin Budget*.
        Failure might mean disappointment or missed connections instead of disaster.

In a**fantasy**or**adventure**scenario, physical danger is more common, but it
        should still be grounded in relationships and consequences. A dungeon is more than rooms with traps; it is a
        place tied to factions, history, and myth. Tags like*Forgotten Oaths*,*Lingering Magic*, or*Unstable Passageways*can inspire Checks that go beyond “open the door” or “fight the guardian.”

In**horror and mystery**, Clocks track creeping dread and the spread of corruption or
        knowledge. Failure rarely stops the story; it reveals something terrible at a worse time. Consider Tags such
        as*Shifting Shadows*,*Whispers in the Walls*, or*Everyone Knows but No One Says*.
        Safety tools from Chapter 20 are especially important here to keep the experience intense but consensual.

In**modern**or**near‑future**scenarios, institutions and media become part of
        the fiction. Clocks might track news cycles, public outrage, or legal consequences. A “leak the evidence”
        scenario could feature Tags like*Always Online*,*Spin Machine*, and*Jaded Audience*,
        with outcomes changing which communities are willing to help the characters.

In**science‑fiction**scenarios, environment and technology are front and center. Space
        stations, starships, and off‑world colonies all encourage Tags such as*Life Support Strained*,*Unstable Gravity*, or*Corporate Patent Lock*. Clocks might track orbital windows or system
        failures. Even here, keep the focus on people: who lives with these technologies, and what they are afraid
        of losing.

### Worked Example: The Skybridge Sabotage

To see these tools in motion, imagine a short arc built around a single scenario: preventing the sabotage of
        a vital skybridge that connects two districts of a floating city. The front is*Trade War Escalation*,
        with a Clock that will fill if the bridge is destroyed.

You begin by defining stakes. If the bridge falls, thousands of workers lose access to jobs and resources,
        and one faction gains a ruthless bargaining chip. If it is saved, trade continues, but whoever is blamed for
        the attempt may face a backlash. Walking away is also a choice; in that case, the city’s Tags might shift
        toward*Fragmented*and*Desperate*, and future scenarios will reflect that fracture.

You sketch three locations: the bridge itself (Tags:*Exposed*,*Wind‑Swept*), a nearby union
        hall (*Organized*,*Overworked*), and a corporate control tower (*Surveilled*,*Restricted Access*). Each location suggests natural scenes and Checks, from rallying workers to
        sneaking into maintenance tunnels to confronting executives.

Key NPCs include a union organizer who suspects something is wrong but lacks proof, a security chief torn
        between loyalty and doubt, and a saboteur who believes destroying the bridge will prevent a worse outcome.
        Each has a clear desire and Tags to match—perhaps*Committed but Tired*,*By‑the‑Book*, and*Haunted by Past Disaster*. Their conflicting goals create choices even before any dice are rolled.

You add Clocks:*Explosives Planted*(4 segments),*Security Lockdown*(6 segments), and*Public Blame Misplaced*(8 segments). Early investigative scenes advance the first Clock if the
        group lingers; public missteps might tick up the third. In action scenes, failed or Partial Success Checks
        can push any of these Clocks forward, ensuring that tension rises even when characters make progress.

At the table, you might run this scenario as a one‑shot by starting with the organizer bursting into the
        union hall shouting that something is wrong, or as a multi‑session arc by spending more time exploring the
        politics around the bridge. In both cases, the underlying design stays the same: clear stakes, defined
        pressures, locations and NPCs with Tags, and Clocks that track how close the city is to a point of no
        return.

### Adapting Scenarios to the Table

Even well‑designed scenarios will shift once players engage with them. Be ready to adjust DCs, Tags, and
        Clocks based on creative approaches and new information.

When players come up with clever plans that skip parts of your scenario, treat that as success, not a
        problem. Reward them rather than forcing them back onto unused material. If a planned threat no longer feels
        relevant, retire its Clock and introduce a new one that reflects the current situation instead of insisting
        on the original script.

Invite players to define minor details—“What does the old guild hall look like now?”—to keep the world
        grounded in their perspectives. Their answers often suggest new Tags, NPCs, or Clocks that you can weave
        into future scenarios. Over time, build a library of reusable locations and situations that you can
        re‑skin for different genres and campaigns by changing Tags, NPCs, and stakes while keeping the underlying
        structure.
