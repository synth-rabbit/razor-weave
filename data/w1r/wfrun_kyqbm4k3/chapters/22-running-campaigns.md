## 22. Running Campaigns

A campaign is a series of connected sessions that follow the same characters, themes, and pressures over
        time. This chapter helps you turn individual adventures into arcs, connect arcs into larger stories, and
        use advancement, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks to track long‑term change.

### Campaign Shape and Length

Campaigns come in many shapes. Some are short, focused arcs. Others are sprawling journeys with multiple
        fronts. The system assumes campaigns are built from arcs: clusters of sessions that focus on one central
        problem or question.

**Short arcs**, typically three to five sessions long, revolve around a single front or
        problem. A crime spree in one district, a contested political vote, or a rescue mission behind enemy lines
        can all form the spine of a short arc. These arcs are ideal for testing a new setting or running a limited
        “season” between longer campaigns.

**Medium arcs**last closer to six to ten sessions. They involve several interlinked fronts,
        at least one major faction, and a clear turning point where the direction of the story changes. A labor
        dispute that escalates into city‑wide unrest, or a mystery that uncovers a deeper conspiracy, often fits
        this scale.

**Long arcs**stretch beyond ten sessions. They weave together multiple fronts that evolve
        over time, recurring NPCs who grow and change, and locations whose Tags shift as the campaign progresses.
        Long arcs benefit from regular pauses to reflect on what has changed and whether the table wants to
        continue in the same direction or pivot toward new threats and opportunities.

Decide the starting size of your first arc and be transparent with players. This helps set expectations for
        tone, pacing, and how quickly advancement will appear.

### Setting Up a New Campaign

Before your first session, talk with your players about the kind of story you want to tell. Use questions
        to define tone, themes, and constraints.

Ask what kinds of problems everyone wants to face: mystery and investigation, survival against harsh
        conditions, political maneuvering, heists and infiltration, or a blend of several. Talk about how intense
        you want danger and horror to be, from gentle tension to truly harrowing stakes. Discuss which parts of the
        setting are most exciting—factions, technology, magic, community, or something stranger—and how often you
        expect to play together, and for how long each session will run.

Translate these answers into Tags and initial fronts: named threats or pressures with Clocks attached (see
        Chapter 25 for a deeper front framework). Prepare a few starting locations and NPCs that express those
        themes.

> **Example**
> **Example – Campaign Setup**
The group chooses a campaign about workers organizing in a hazardous sky‑dock. The GM defines a*Corporate Crackdown*front with a 6‑segment Clock, Tags like*Surveillance*and*Hazardous*, and key NPCs in management and the union. Early sessions revolve around protests,
>         sabotage, and negotiations.

### Advancement and Long‑Term Change

Chapter 19 explains how characters advance. In a campaign, advancement also reflects how the world changes.
        As characters grow, update location and faction Tags, retire old Clocks, and introduce new ones.

Whenever possible, tie Attribute, Skill, and Proficiency advancements to specific scenes and decisions. A
        new Skill might grow out of repeated investigative work in a particular archive, while a Proficiency in
        “Harbor Operations” emerges from hard‑won experience dodging inspections. Naming these connections in play
        makes advancement feel earned and grounded in the fiction.

Edge Conditions—such as*Backed by Authority*,*Inspired*, or*Sheltered*—are also
        signs of long‑term change. Use them to mark new advantages the group has earned: a patron’s protection, a
        community’s trust, or a personal breakthrough. When those Conditions appear, think about how they might
        shape upcoming scenes and fronts.

When a Clock completes, pause to ask what is permanently different in the world now. Has a faction gained
        or lost power? Has a neighborhood’s Tag shifted from*Marginalized*to*Organized*? Over
        time, your campaign map should show scars and growth: old Tags crossed out, new Tags added, fronts resolved
        or transformed rather than quietly forgotten.

Over time, your campaign map should show scars and growth: old Tags crossed out, new Tags added, fronts
        resolved or transformed.

### Between‑Session Prep

Between sessions, keep prep light and focused. You do not need to predict everything players will do. You
        only need to know how the world responds to what already happened and what pressures are rising.

Start by advancing or adjusting active fronts and Clocks based on the last session’s events. If players
        ignored a looming threat, decide how it moves forward. If they struck a decisive blow, consider whether a
        Clock should tick backward, stall, or be replaced by a new, more subtle danger.

Then choose two or three likely scenes or locations for the next session. You do not need to lock them in;
        they are waypoints you can steer toward or away from depending on player choices. As you review your notes,
        update NPC Tags to reflect recent outcomes and jot down any advancement triggers you want to highlight,
        such as resolved personal threads or significant sacrifices.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Prep Questions, Not Scripts**
Instead of writing a detailed sequence of scenes, prepare questions the next session might answer: “Who will
>         the union trust?” “How far will the corporation go?” Let player choices and outcomes decide how those
>         questions resolve.

### Ending Arcs and Starting New Ones

When a major front concludes or a central Clock completes, you have reached the end of an arc. Take time to
        mark this in the fiction and in the mechanics.

Hold a reflection scene or brief epilogue that shows the consequences of recent events. Let players see how
        their actions changed NPCs, neighborhoods, and factions. This is a natural moment to apply a round of
        advancement, especially for relationships and reputations, and to talk about what each character has
        learned.

As you close the arc, update or retire Tags and Conditions that no longer apply. A city that was once*Occupied*might now be tagged*Uncertain Governance*. A character who carried*Haunted by
        the Siege*for many sessions might finally resolve that Condition—or transform it into something new.
        Introduce new fronts or questions that point toward the next arc, even if you do not know exactly how they
        will unfold yet.

Ending arcs cleanly makes campaigns feel intentional rather than endless. It also gives players natural
        points to retire characters, adjust expectations, or shift focus to different parts of the world. Use these
        transitions to check in about tone, pacing, and which themes everyone wants to explore next.
