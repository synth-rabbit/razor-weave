## Priority Rankings
1. **Chapter 10 - Combat Basics** (Severity: 10, Frequency: 14/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096216-z68czo4h2, gen-1763913096212-rbhtrfavf, gen-1763913096216-obqhtpz6f, gen-1763913096215-6l23ebgok, gen-1763913096221-n4sevcudo, gen-1763913096233-cl97sm0pi, gen-1763913096219-bjvva5oxj, gen-1763913096222-5y9ikdivf, gen-1763913096232-cwhy5hgqa, gen-1763913096234-ht7gs1mbd, gen-1763913096239-uw3849432, gen-1763913096247-be4zelw61, gen-1763913096252-8omf9tia8
   - Description: Clock advancement mechanics in shared-authority or GMless contexts lack explicit procedures for who decides when a Clock advances; The interaction between Positioning Tags, environmental effects, and Conditions creates compounding complexity in multi-combatant fights; The interaction between Strike actions and Conditions requires careful frame-by-frame narration to avoid confusion about who's affected

2. **Chapter 6 - Character Creation** (Severity: 9, Frequency: 13/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096216-z68czo4h2, gen-1763913096212-rbhtrfavf, gen-1763913096216-obqhtpz6f, gen-1763913096215-6l23ebgok, gen-1763913096221-n4sevcudo, gen-1763913096233-cl97sm0pi, gen-1763913096219-bjvva5oxj, gen-1763913096222-5y9ikdivf, gen-1763913096232-cwhy5hgqa, gen-1763913096234-ht7gs1mbd, gen-1763913096239-uw3849432, gen-1763913096246-de2su386r, gen-1763913096249-f6wg7mamq
   - Description: While the nine-step process is clear, the Quick-Start option might oversimplify Proficiency selection for explorers who value character uniqueness; The nine-step process is thorough but may overwhelm new players if done in a single session; Step Four (Determine Attributes) offers significant mechanical complexity with linked progression systems

3. **Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, Clocks** (Severity: 8, Frequency: 12/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096216-z68czo4h2, gen-1763913096216-to24ofm5l, gen-1763913096216-obqhtpz6f, gen-1763913096221-n4sevcudo, gen-1763913096222-5y9ikdivf, gen-1763913096234-ht7gs1mbd, gen-1763913096246-agudq89dk, gen-1763913096239-uw3849432, gen-1763913096247-be4zelw61, gen-1763913096252-8omf9tia8, gen-1763913096257-94ywns63g
   - Description: The distinction between Tags (scene/location) and Conditions (character) remains slightly ambiguous in edge cases, particularly during GMless play when authority rotates; The Condition section could benefit from more explicit guidance on when GMs introduce conditions vs. when players request them; While elegant, the three-system design (Tags/Conditions/Clocks) requires GMs to think in three parallel tracks simultaneously

4. **Chapter 5 - Ways to Play** (Severity: 7, Frequency: 12/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096216-to24ofm5l, gen-1763913096212-rbhtrfavf, gen-1763913096221-n4sevcudo, gen-1763913096233-cl97sm0pi, gen-1763913096219-bjvva5oxj, gen-1763913096222-5y9ikdivf, gen-1763913096234-ht7gs1mbd, gen-1763913096246-agudq89dk, gen-1763913096242-1k0b8qa9f, gen-1763913096263-r6rxj4w61, gen-1763913096257-94ywns63g, gen-1763913096249-f6wg7mamq
   - Description: Claims about GMless and solo play support are not mechanically substantiated; Solo Play mechanics are mentioned but lack concrete system support compared to group play; The expanded support for alternative modes is excellent, but GMless and solo play sections feel like they could benefit from sample scenarios

5. **Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes** (Severity: 6, Frequency: 9/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096216-to24ofm5l, gen-1763913096212-rbhtrfavf, gen-1763913096216-obqhtpz6f, gen-1763913096215-6l23ebgok, gen-1763913096233-cl97sm0pi, gen-1763913096219-bjvva5oxj, gen-1763913096222-5y9ikdivf, gen-1763913096232-cwhy5hgqa, gen-1763913096234-ht7gs1mbd
   - Description: Edge and Burden mechanics interaction with Tags/Conditions could use a comprehensive worked example; DC setting guidance relies heavily on GM judgment; table-to-table variance in difficulty could be significant; The Partial Success outcome can create narrative ambiguity about how fictional consequences manifest

6. **Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, Outcomes** (Severity: 5, Frequency: 9/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096221-n4sevcudo, gen-1763913096239-uw3849432, gen-1763913096246-de2su386r, gen-1763913096242-1k0b8qa9f, gen-1763913096247-be4zelw61, gen-1763913096252-8omf9tia8, gen-1763913096263-r6rxj4w61, gen-1763913096257-94ywns63g, gen-1763913096249-f6wg7mamq
   - Description: The modification clarifies intent-to-outcome mapping well, but edge cases around contested checks in collaborative contexts need more examples; The 4d6 resolution system is elegant, but the difficulty ladder (DC 8-15) would benefit from a quick reference showing what difficulty represents in narrative terms; The section on opposing rolls and relative success could benefit from a probability table showing odds at various DC tiers

7. **Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, and Clocks** (Severity: 4, Frequency: 5/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096212-rbhtrfavf, gen-1763913096215-6l23ebgok, gen-1763913096233-cl97sm0pi, gen-1763913096219-bjvva5oxj, gen-1763913096232-cwhy5hgqa
   - Description: The distinction between Scene Tags (environmental) and Character Tags (applied conditionally) requires clear table agreement; Clock advancement guidance uses phrases like "moderate progress" and "significant progress" which still require GM calibration; While the conceptual distinction between Tags and Conditions is clear, the practical boundary can blur in improvisation

8. **Chapter 20 - Optional Variant Rules** (Severity: 3, Frequency: 4/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096246-agudq89dk, gen-1763913096242-1k0b8qa9f, gen-1763913096263-r6rxj4w61, gen-1763913096257-94ywns63g
   - Description: The variant rules are presented clearly, but some casual groups may not realize which variants best match their playstyle; Variant rules are presented individually without explicit compatibility matrix or mechanical interaction guidance; Variant rules exist but could provide more guidance on which variants pair well together and potential interaction issues

9. **Chapter 14-15 - Skills System** (Severity: 2, Frequency: 3/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096246-agudq89dk, gen-1763913096239-uw3849432, gen-1763913096249-f6wg7mamq
   - Description: The full skills reference with all attribute combinations could be overwhelming for casual tables on first read; Skills are organized logically by attribute, but there's no quick-reference table showing which skills are most common in practice; Seventy-two skills with semantic distinctions that don't carry mechanical weight (e.g., Sleight of Hand vs Pickpocketing both use d6+Subterfuge)

10. **Chapter 12 - Downtime, Recovery, Advancement Overview** (Severity: 1, Frequency: 2/20)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763913096247-be4zelw61, gen-1763913096257-94ywns63g
   - Description: Missing worked example of multi-character simultaneous downtime management; Advancement is described functionally but without discussion of mechanical power scaling across campaign levels
