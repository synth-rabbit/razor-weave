   - Affected personas: core-devon-solo-player, core-casey-neurodivergent, core-riley-rules-lawyer, core-taylor-video-game-convert, core-marcus-osr-veteran
   - Description: All worked examples assume GM/player separation; Insufficient worked examples for complex actions like Maneuvers - only 3-4 examples provided; Outcome tier descriptions use subjective language ('minor setback', 'significant complication') without concrete examples

   - Affected personas: core-alex-indie-convert, core-sam-forever-gm, core-devon-solo-player

   - Affected personas: core-alex-indie-convert, core-sam-forever-gm, core-marcus-osr-veteran
   - Description: Session structure and pacing guidance is strong but light on cross-session continuity for Tags and Clocks; Session structure guidance is excellent but light on cross-session continuity of Tags and Clocks; GM guidance emphasizes collaborative facilitation over procedural world simulation

7. **Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play** (Severity: 4, Frequency: 3/11)
   - Affected personas: core-sarah-new-gm, core-casey-neurodivergent
   - Description: Fiction-first philosophy explained conceptually but not practically; The 'fiction first' mandate creates barriers for pattern-driven thinkers who need mechanical frameworks before fictional narration

   - Affected personas: core-morgan-method-actor, core-taylor-video-game-convert, core-marcus-osr-veteran
   - Description: The 'Working with Low Attributes' section is good but could go deeper on character expression; Limited attribute differentiation (2/1/1/0 spread) provides minimal mechanical distinction between characters; Attribute array (2/1/1/0) provides insufficient mechanical differentiation for long campaigns

9. **Chapter 15: Skills Reference** (Severity: 2, Frequency: 2/11)
   - Affected personas: core-sarah-new-gm, core-devon-solo-player
   - Description: Detailed Skill descriptions too lengthy for quick at-table reference; Social Skills lack solo play adaptations or procedures
