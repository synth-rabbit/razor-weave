   - Description: Add worked examples showing how multiple tags stack to affect DC (e.g., Dim Light + Crowded + Alert = what specific DC shift?); Include a session prep checklist that shows the numerical prep a sandbox GM would do; Consider adding character archetype examples that show how attribute distributions create different play experiences

2. **Chapter 6: Character Creation** (Severity: 9, Frequency: 12/39)
   - Affected personas: core-marcus-osr-veteran, core-alex-indie-convert, core-devon-solo-player, core-casey-neurodivergent, core-morgan-method-actor, gen-1763993189234-599q2pa9v, gen-1763993189270-p5mt2ti0m, gen-1763993189263-ajolpmqnl, gen-1763993189232-prjgtbfob, gen-1763993189237-99xbqsk4o, gen-1763993189235-txjyevjus, gen-1763993189256-x2mt14ne7
   - Description: Gear section lacks mechanical weight; Skills vs. Proficiencies distinction requires significant explanation for traditional RPG converts; Thread creation is group-oriented

3. **Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes** (Severity: 8, Frequency: 10/39)
   - Affected personas: core-marcus-osr-veteran, core-devon-solo-player, core-casey-neurodivergent, core-morgan-method-actor, gen-1763993189263-ajolpmqnl, gen-1763993189232-prjgtbfob, gen-1763993189278-im6cqyjyq, gen-1763993189235-txjyevjus, gen-1763993189256-x2mt14ne7
   - Description: Outcome tiers lack concrete damage/effect values; DC setting guidance assumes GM presence; Edge/Burden application relies on contextual judgment without clear decision rules

4. **Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks** (Severity: 7, Frequency: 10/39)
   - Affected personas: core-marcus-osr-veteran, core-casey-neurodivergent, gen-1763993189270-p5mt2ti0m, gen-1763993189263-ajolpmqnl, gen-1763993189232-prjgtbfob, gen-1763993189278-im6cqyjyq, gen-1763993189237-99xbqsk4o, gen-1763993189256-x2mt14ne7
   - Description: Clock tick rates require GM interpretation; Dual-effect Tags (like Dim Light) require situation-by-situation interpretation; Clock advancement rates vary (1-2 or 2-3 segments) without clear triggers for choosing

5. **Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes** (Severity: 6, Frequency: 6/39)
   - Affected personas: core-riley-rules-lawyer, core-jordan-busy-parent, gen-1763993189231-30zwmobyj, gen-1763993189230-tjsxvgkkb, gen-1763993189268-y2lcd8kvb, gen-1763993189249-fr7crcedc
   - Description: Margin-based outcome tiers need clearer connection to subsystems. Partial Success on social checks says "cost or complication" but these are prompts, not mechanics.; The explanation of when to apply Skills vs Proficiencies vs Tags to a Check could be clearer for quick reference; DC ladder could use quick-reference visual

6. **Chapter 10: Combat Basics** (Severity: 5, Frequency: 4/39)
   - Affected personas: core-marcus-osr-veteran, core-alex-indie-convert, gen-1763993189263-ajolpmqnl, gen-1763993189232-prjgtbfob
   - Description: Missing weapon and armor statistics; The transition from conversational combat to structured turns lacks explicit triggers; Taken out outcomes are narratively flexible rather than mechanically defined

7. **Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play** (Severity: 4, Frequency: 3/39)
   - Affected personas: core-alex-indie-convert, gen-1763993189270-p5mt2ti0m, gen-1763993189235-txjyevjus
   - Description: GM guidance principles are excellent but distributed across multiple chapters; Duplicate 'Example' labels in example boxes; Failure Creates Momentum section provides philosophy without concrete tools

8. **Chapter 10 - Combat Basics** (Severity: 3, Frequency: 3/39)
   - Affected personas: core-jordan-busy-parent, gen-1763993189230-tjsxvgkkb, gen-1763993189249-fr7crcedc
   - Description: The Resolve Clock system is elegant but the tick progression table should be more prominently displayed; The note states the GM establishes relevant threat Clocks at the start of combat or introduces them as the situation develops but provides no guidance on when mid-combat Clock introduction is appropriate versus disruptive.; Conditions applied during combat (Stunned, Burning, Dazed) lack standardized mechanical severity. Text says Conditions modify Checks but not by how much

9. **Chapter 7: Characters and Attributes** (Severity: 2, Frequency: 2/39)
   - Affected personas: core-marcus-osr-veteran, core-morgan-method-actor
   - Description: Compressed attribute scale (0-2) reduces character differentiation; Attribute archetypes could include more personality-driven examples

10. **Chapter 3: How to Use This Rulebook** (Severity: 1, Frequency: 2/39)
   - Affected personas: core-alex-indie-convert, gen-1763993189237-99xbqsk4o
