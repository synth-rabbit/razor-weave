## Executive Summary

The Razorweave Core Rulebook demonstrates strong philosophical foundations and elegant core mechanics (4d6 + Edge/Burden system), but faces significant accessibility challenges for newcomers, tactical players, and time-constrained users. The fiction-first approach resonates strongly with storyteller and indie convert personas but alienates power gamers, killers, and those seeking mechanical precision. **Priority areas for improvement:** Quick-start materials, DC ladder terminology consistency, explicit mechanical definitions (Skill bonuses, clock segments), and dedicated combat/tactical guidance.

| Rules Accuracy | **7.7/10** | 5-9 |
| Persona Fit | **6.2/10** | 4-9 |

## Top 5 Priority Issues (Severity x Frequency)

### 1. Missing Quick-Start Materials (Severity: 9, Frequency: 12/20)

**Affected Personas:** New GM, Busy Parent, Video Game Convert, Newbie Casual, Newbie Power Gamer, Neurodivergent Player, Solo Player, all Killer archetypes, and several generated personas

**Description:** The rulebook lacks a consolidated "quick-start" section with pre-generated characters, a starter scenario, and condensed essential rules. Multiple personas expressed being "overwhelmed" by the 30-chapter structure and requested:
- 5-page quick-start guide
- Pre-made characters
- Starter scenario with pre-built clocks/NPCs
- Character creation walkthrough that doesn't require jumping between chapters

**Impact:** Severely limits accessibility for casual players, newcomers, and those converting from other systems.

---

### 2. DC Ladder Terminology Inconsistency (Severity: 8, Frequency: 3/20)

**Affected Personas:** Rules Lawyer, OSR Veteran, Veteran Tactician

**Description:** Critical contradiction between Chapter 8 and Chapter 29 Quick Reference:
- Chapter 8: DC 12 (Easy), DC 14 (Routine), DC 16 (Tough), DC 18 (Hard), DC 20 (Heroic), DC 22 (Legendary)
- Chapter 29: DC 12 (Routine), DC 14 (Challenging), DC 16 (Difficult), DC 18 (Formidable)

This is described as "simply an editing failure" that "will cause arguments at the table."

**Impact:** Undermines trust in rulebook precision and creates table disputes.

---

### 3. Undefined Skill Bonus Mechanics (Severity: 8, Frequency: 5/20)

**Affected Personas:** Rules Lawyer, OSR Veteran, Video Game Convert, Power Gamer, Neurodivergent Player

**Description:** The check procedure references "add the relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects" but **no numerical Skill bonus is ever defined**. Skills are described qualitatively without quantification.

**Impact:** Fundamental gap preventing consistent mechanical adjudication.

---

### 4. Insufficient Combat/Tactical Depth (Severity: 7, Frequency: 8/20)

**Affected Personas:** All Killer archetypes (3), OSR Veteran, Video Game Convert, Power Gamer, Tactician personas (2)

**Description:** Combat-focused and tactical players consistently reported:
- Combat "folded into general Check structure" without special treatment
- No dedicated combat chapter with worked fight examples
- Missing hit points, damage calculations, clear defeat conditions
- Resolve Clock sizing guidance too vague ("2-3 segments for quick threats")
- Request for tactical grid options, special moves, combo abilities

**Impact:** System fails to serve a significant player archetype that values mechanical combat mastery.

---

### 5. Insufficient GMless/Solo Play Procedures (Severity: 7, Frequency: 6/20)

**Affected Personas:** Solo Player, Casual Gamer Long-term GM, Method Actor (GMless advocate), Generated Socializer

**Description:** While the book acknowledges GMless and solo play, specific procedural gaps include:
- Oracle tables mentioned but not provided
- "Rotating authority" described without concrete procedures
- Solo guidance scattered across Chapters 5, 24, 26, and 27
- No random tables for NPC generation, scene complications, environment details
- VPC system well-designed but lacks consolidation

**Impact:** Players seeking alternative play modes must supplement with external tools.

---

## Additional Priority Issues (6-10)

### 6. Open-Ended Skills/Proficiencies Without Guidance (Severity: 6, Frequency: 9/20)

Players who prefer explicit options found the "work with your GM to define custom entries" approach frustrating. New GMs expressed uncertainty about what's "reasonable" without a reference list.

### 7. Clock Segment Advancement Inconsistency (Severity: 6, Frequency: 4/20)

Text states "Successful Checks tick the Clock forward" but doesn't consistently specify segments. Some examples show "Full Success = 2 segments, Partial = 1 segment" but it's unclear if this is standard or situational.

### 8. Insufficient Scaffolding for New GMs (Severity: 6, Frequency: 4/20)

New GM expressed: "The book repeatedly says 'you'll learn this over time' but I need to run my FIRST session somehow." Phrases like "present the world honestly" lack concrete guidance.

### 9. Progression System Ambiguity (Severity: 5, Frequency: 5/20)

Video game converts and power gamers wanted concrete XP costs, level-up triggers, and power scaling charts. "Milestone/session-based" advancement feels arbitrary to those seeking measurable progress.

### 10. Tag/Condition Timing Unclear (Severity: 5, Frequency: 3/20)

No explicit procedure for when Tags or Conditions clear. Edge vs DC shifting for Tags also inconsistently documented.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Immediate Actions (Pre-release Critical)

1. **Standardize DC ladder terminology** between Chapter 8 and Quick Reference
2. **Define Skill bonus mechanic explicitly** (numerical value or explicit "no bonus" statement)
3. **Clarify clock segment advancement** as standard rule vs example

### High-Priority Additions

4. **Create Quick-Start section** (5-10 pages):
   - Essential rules summary
   - 4-6 pre-generated characters
   - Starter scenario with pre-built clocks, NPCs, scene structure

5. **Add dedicated Combat/Conflict chapter**:
   - Worked fight examples
   - Clear defeat conditions
   - Tactical positioning options (optional)
   - Resolve Clock sizing guidance

6. **Consolidate solo play tools**:
   - Oracle tables (Yes/No/Complication + detail generators)
   - Random NPC/complication/environment tables
   - Single "Solo Play" section referencing all relevant material

### Medium-Priority Enhancements

7. **Create common action-to-Attribute reference** table
8. **Provide sample Skill/Proficiency lists** by genre
9. **Expand GMless procedures** with concrete rotation mechanics
10. **Add Tag/Condition lifecycle guidance** (when they clear, how they stack)

### Format Improvements

11. **GM screen PDF** with Quick Reference, outcome tiers, clock guidance
12. **Move Quick Reference to front** of book or provide bookmark placement
13. **Character creation single-chapter walkthrough** (reduce cross-references)

## Conclusion

The Razorweave Core Rulebook represents a thoughtfully designed fiction-first RPG with elegant mechanics and strong philosophical foundations. It excels for storyteller-focused groups and experienced GMs seeking to reduce mechanical overhead. However, significant accessibility barriers exist for newcomers, tactical players, and those requiring procedural clarity.

**Core Tension:** The book tries to serve both narrative and procedural needs but doesn't fully satisfy either extreme. The fiction-first philosophy is over-explained for veterans while providing insufficient scaffolding for newcomers.

**Bottom Line:** With the addition of quick-start materials, terminology standardization, and mechanical clarifications, this could be an 8-9/10 system. Current state: **7.0/10 overall**, with significant variance by player type (4-9/10).
