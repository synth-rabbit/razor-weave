## Priority Rankings
1. **Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes** (Severity: 10, Frequency: 14/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189233-jpa6qo77a, gen-1763993189242-64xgt3fqg, gen-1763993189252-y4nqa9b3m, gen-1763993189258-ryaixkth3, gen-1763993189254-hcfhqxfd8, gen-1763993189268-ebyj6w4r5, gen-1763993189277-7vtfzu797, gen-1763993189278-bhwvjgbl9, gen-1763993189278-d3f2bvnwg, gen-1763993189280-z7n0wkagw, gen-1763993189282-pjuwot8bw
   - Description: DC setting explicitly delegated to GM judgment without procedures for shared/rotating authority; The distinction between when to use Edge/Burden versus DC adjustment is not explicitly formalized. The text shows examples of both, but the decision framework for 'should this circumstance grant Edge or change the DC?' is left implicit. For a new GM who needs concrete numbers, this creates uncertainty.; Critical rules reference material (Partial Success cost tables) is embedded deep in Chapter 8 rather than collected in a GM quick-reference section. The tables span pages 5272-5417 in the full book, requiring extensive cross-referencing during play.

2. **Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes** (Severity: 9, Frequency: 10/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189235-05ypbajjv, gen-1763993189230-syrl22w6s, gen-1763993189252-57xv21d9o, gen-1763993189260-9n6afdejp, gen-1763993189263-k9ukeik2k, gen-1763993189263-u167sjdz5, gen-1763993189269-pd9tk3gto, gen-1763993189270-off8ks70q, gen-1763993189274-c6tokpuh8
   - Description: No explicit guidance on gating plot progression behind Check success; When to roll versus auto-succeed is GM discretion rather than systematic, making player planning difficult; Guidance on when to roll versus when to simply describe is spread across multiple sections and sometimes contradictory

3. **Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, and Clocks** (Severity: 8, Frequency: 9/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189248-q9d1t4y2d, gen-1763993189243-dwp8db6sj, gen-1763993189242-64xgt3fqg, gen-1763993189252-y4nqa9b3m, gen-1763993189268-ebyj6w4r5, gen-1763993189270-ekup7zqj1, gen-1763993189278-bhwvjgbl9, gen-1763993189278-d3f2bvnwg, gen-1763993189280-z7n0wkagw
   - Description: The Clock system is described textually with examples, but no visual templates, printable reference sheets, or diagram formats are provided. For visual cognitive style players and GMs, this omits the primary learning modality.; Tag modifiers are described as 'GM decides based on fiction' with minimal concrete guidance. The book does not provide reference tables showing how common Tags (Crowded, Dim Light, Patrolled) numerically modify DCs in standard situations.; While the system provides extensive tables for how margins affect Clocks, Conditions, and Tags, the priority order when multiple subsystems conflict is not addressed. If my Critical Success (+5) against an enemy could tick 3 Resolve segments OR apply a lasting Condition OR create a beneficial Tag, how do I choose? The fiction determines this, but tactical players need explicit guidance on trade-offs.

4. **Chapter 10: Combat Basics** (Severity: 7, Frequency: 8/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189235-05ypbajjv, gen-1763993189230-syrl22w6s, gen-1763993189233-htu0gxpv4, gen-1763993189252-57xv21d9o, gen-1763993189260-9n6afdejp, gen-1763993189263-u167sjdz5
   - Description: Abstract positioning and conversational turn order lack tactical depth; Resolve Clock abstraction and per-scene 'taken out' definition removes tactical resource management; Highly tactical mechanical combat system contradicts narrative-purist philosophy

5. **Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks** (Severity: 6, Frequency: 8/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189230-syrl22w6s, gen-1763993189252-57xv21d9o, gen-1763993189263-u167sjdz5, gen-1763993189269-pd9tk3gto, gen-1763993189270-off8ks70q, gen-1763993189270-p5mt2ti0m, gen-1763993189274-c6tokpuh8
   - Description: Tags and Conditions have narratively-determined effects rather than systematic mechanical outcomes; The distinction between Tags (narrative) and Conditions (mechanical) can blur in actual play; Criteria for granting Edge versus lowering DC is insufficiently specified

6. **Chapter 4 - Core Principles of Play** (Severity: 5, Frequency: 7/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189248-q9d1t4y2d, gen-1763993189237-xkyr1w1wp, gen-1763993189242-64xgt3fqg, gen-1763993189252-y4nqa9b3m, gen-1763993189263-2qnuw8s85, gen-1763993189270-ekup7zqj1, gen-1763993189282-pjuwot8bw
   - Description: The 'Fiction First, Mechanics Second' principle states that 'A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain, the stakes matter to the story, and failure or partial success would move the scene forward.' However, no concrete examples or decision flowchart help GMs identify when these three conditions are simultaneously met. Skeptical fiction-first practitioners need triggers, not just philosophy.; The principles strongly support collaborative play - 'Trust holds everything in place,' 'Present situations honestly,' 'The world responds' - but frame them entirely through GM-player relationship rather than table-wide social contract.; The sandbox prep checklist is excellent but assumes familiarity with pacing and workload management. A new GM reading 'Update Active Clocks,' 'Prepare Location DCs,' 'Define NPC Resolve,' and 'Set Consequences' might feel overwhelmed without guidance on time investment—how long should this prep take? Which elements are essential versus optional for a 3-hour session?

7. **Chapter 19 - Advancement and Long Term Growth** (Severity: 4, Frequency: 7/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189254-hcfhqxfd8, gen-1763993189268-ebyj6w4r5, gen-1763993189270-ekup7zqj1, gen-1763993189278-bhwvjgbl9, gen-1763993189278-d3f2bvnwg, gen-1763993189280-z7n0wkagw, gen-1763993189282-pjuwot8bw
   - Description: Advancement pacing guidance is flexible (every 3-4 sessions, milestones, or downtime), but lacks hard numbers for campaign arc planning. No clear answer to 'How many advancements should a character get in a 10-session arc?' or 'What's a reasonable Attribute cap for a year-long campaign?'; Advancement pacing metrics vague - the text presents multiple progression models (milestone, session-based, arc-based) but provides limited guidance for calibrating advancement speed. How many sessions should typically pass between major advancement events? How does this change based on genre or play style?; Advancement guidance focuses on milestone structures and narrative integration but provides minimal concrete pacing recommendations for long-term campaigns (20+ sessions, 50+ sessions, multi-year play). How many total Skills and Proficiencies should a veteran character accumulate? When does advancement slow or cap? The book trusts GM judgment but offers no benchmarks.

8. **Chapter 26 - Alternative Play** (Severity: 3, Frequency: 5/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189233-jpa6qo77a, gen-1763993189248-q9d1t4y2d, gen-1763993189237-xkyr1w1wp, gen-1763993189282-pjuwot8bw
   - Description: GMless play receives only 2 paragraphs of guidance; GMless and shared authority play receive minimal treatment despite being mentioned in Chapter 5. The book's core principles assume GM-as-world-presenter model. Distributed authority requires different scene framing protocols, conflict resolution when players disagree about world facts, and mechanics for rotating spotlight—none of which are addressed systematically.; GMless play receives minimal treatment (approximately 2 pages) compared to 25 chapters of GM-focused content. The guidance provided - 'clarify roles,' 'use oracles,' 'rotate responsibilities' - is surface-level and doesn't explore the structural changes needed for truly distributed authority.

9. **Chapter 6 - Character Creation** (Severity: 2, Frequency: 5/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189233-jpa6qo77a, gen-1763993189265-0kwi5jgxq, gen-1763993189263-2qnuw8s85, gen-1763993189277-7vtfzu797, gen-1763993189278-bhwvjgbl9
   - Description: Solo/GMless thread creation focuses on solo play (one player + oracle) not true GMless (multiple players, shared authority); Quick start options assume familiarity with TTRPG concepts. Terms like 'action verbs your character has practiced,' 'areas of knowledge,' and 'playable character' lack context for absolute beginners. The distinction between Skills and Proficiencies is unclear without reading Chapters 14-17.; Extensive probability calculations and optimization guides (e.g., '84% success rate at DC 14 with Skill') prioritize mechanical analysis over narrative decision-making. Multiple pages devoted to archetype builds with detailed success percentages.

10. **Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play** (Severity: 1, Frequency: 5/31)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763993189235-05ypbajjv, gen-1763993189233-htu0gxpv4, gen-1763993189252-57xv21d9o, gen-1763993189263-k9ukeik2k
   - Description: New sandbox prep checklist assumes emergent play rather than structured scenario design; Claims fiction-first philosophy while maintaining traditional GM authority structure throughout; Fiction-first explanation assumes reader buy-in rather than addressing skepticism or alternative play styles
