## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so I'm pretty new to tabletop RPGs - I've only been playing for about eight months now, mostly online with friends who got me into this. I came from doing some improv theater in college, so when someone described this game as "fiction first" and "method actor friendly," I was immediately curious.

First impression: this book is dense. Like, there's a lot here. But not in a bad way? It's more like... I can tell they're trying to explain everything really clearly, and I appreciate that as someone still learning. The Welcome chapter made me feel like I wasn't expected to memorize everything before starting, which was a relief.

What really hooked me was Chapter 4, the Core Principles section. The idea that I describe what my character does FIRST, before worrying about dice - that makes so much sense to me. In my acting experience, you don't think about blocking before you know what your character wants. Intent and approach, like they describe it here, that maps perfectly to how I already think about getting into a character's headspace.

Character creation in Chapter 6 was honestly exciting. Starting with a concept and building identity elements - name, habits, mannerisms, key experiences - before touching any numbers? This is how I naturally build characters anyway! The example character Rella felt like a real person with history and quirks, not just a stat block. I could imagine playing her.

The Tags and Conditions system in Chapter 9 speaks to me as someone who wants to embody a character. When you're Frightened or Exhausted, it's not just a penalty - it's something to roleplay. I love that the book explicitly encourages you to let these states show up in how you describe your character. Stagger when hurt. Hesitate when scared. That's exactly what a method approach would tell you to do.

Where I struggled a bit: the math and dice mechanics took me a few reads to fully grasp. The 4d6 system with Edge and Burden makes sense once I got it, but as someone who's still getting used to RPG conventions, terms like "DC ladder" and "margin" weren't immediately intuitive. The book explains them clearly, but I found myself flipping back and forth between Chapters 8 and 9 a lot.

Also, as someone who plays rather than GMs, I sometimes felt like sections were written more for the person running the game than for me as a player. The GM guidance boxes are labeled clearly, which helps, but a few times I wondered "do I need to know this?" The answer usually turned out to be "yes, it helps you understand the system," but a cleaner player-vs-GM separation would have helped me focus.

The combat chapter was interesting. I like that they don't use hit points - the Resolve Clock idea makes fights feel more dramatic, like scenes in a story rather than math problems. But the four core combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) felt a bit abstract until I read through the examples carefully. I think I'd need to actually play through a fight to really understand how it flows.

One thing I'm genuinely excited about: this system seems like it would let me focus on character moments rather than optimal builds. There's no pressure to min-max because the mechanics are built to support storytelling first. As someone who wants to get lost in a character, that's exactly what I'm looking for.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The terminology around DCs, margins, and outcome tiers requires multiple reads to internalize for players new to RPGs

**Impact:** Medium - concepts are explained well, but the vocabulary assumes some familiarity with RPG conventions

**Location:** Chapter 8, Setting DCs and Rolling 4d6 sections

### 2. Chapter 6 - Character Creation

**Issue:** The 'Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies' section explains that lists are open and collaborative, but this might feel intimidating for a newbie who doesn't know what options are 'normal'

**Impact:** Medium - more starting suggestions or common examples would help new players feel confident making choices

**Location:** Chapter 6, Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies

### 3. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** The four core combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) are conceptually clear but feel abstract without play experience

**Impact:** Low - the examples help, but a quick-reference summary or decision flowchart would aid learning

**Location:** Chapter 10, Core Combat Actions section

### 4. Chapter 4 - Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Duplicate '**Example**' labels appear in some example boxes (shows 'Example Example' pattern)

**Impact:** Very low - cosmetic formatting issue that creates minor visual confusion

**Location:** Chapter 4, example boxes at lines 22-23, 64-65, 94-95

### 5. General Structure

**Issue:** Player-facing and GM-facing content is often intermixed, which can be overwhelming for a player who doesn't need to know everything

**Impact:** Low - the book clearly labels GM guidance sections, but a dedicated player quick-start would help newbies focus

**Location:** Throughout, particularly Chapters 8, 9, and 10


## Overall Assessment

As a brand new player with a method acting background, the Razorweave Core Rulebook feels like it was designed with someone like me in mind - even if it doesn't always make things easy for a total newbie.

What works beautifully for my playstyle:
- Fiction-first philosophy that matches how I naturally think about character work
- Character creation that starts with concept and identity, not numbers
- Conditions as roleplay hooks that I can embody, not just mechanical penalties
- No pressure to optimize or min-max; the system supports character moments
- Partial success outcomes that create interesting complications rather than dead ends

What was challenging as a newcomer:
- RPG-specific terminology requires adjustment time (DCs, margins, Checks)
- Open-ended Skills and Proficiencies lists are freeing but initially intimidating
- Combat actions feel abstract until you've actually played through them
- Some content is GM-focused and I wasn't always sure what I needed to know

The book does a good job of being thorough without being condescending. I never felt talked down to, but I did feel occasionally overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information. A "player quick-start" section or summary would help newcomers like me identify what's essential versus what's reference material.

Rating Summary:
- Clarity & Readability: 7/10 - Well-written but dense; some vocabulary learning curve
- Rules Accuracy: 7/10 - Internally consistent; minor formatting issues noted
- Persona Fit: 8/10 - Excellent for method actors; fiction-first approach is exactly what I wanted
- Practical Usability: 6/10 - Will need table experience to fully internalize; good reference once learned

Bottom line: I'm definitely going to play this system. The philosophy resonates deeply with how I want to engage with characters. I just know it's going to take a few sessions before the mechanics feel as natural as the roleplay.
