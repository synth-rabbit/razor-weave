## Narrative Feedback

After decades behind the screen and countless systems under my belt, I know what I am looking for in a rulebook. I want a system that respects the fiction while giving me robust tools to challenge my players. I want framework, not script. I want a sandbox I can prep efficiently and run responsively. Razorweave delivers on most of these fronts, and where it falls short, the gaps are manageable.

Let me be direct: this is a fiction-first system that actually commits to its principles. Too many games claim narrative priority but then bury you in mechanical subsystems that contradict that philosophy. Razorweave does not make that mistake. The rules consistently point back to the story. "You do not start with a rule and then try to force the fiction to match it" appears multiple times, and the design follows through on that promise.

The core resolution engine is elegant. The 4d6 bell curve with Edge/Burden modifiers creates meaningful probability spreads without the swingy chaos of d20 systems. As a long-term GM, I appreciate that the mathematics serve the narrative without demanding complex calculations at the table. I can eyeball outcomes and adjust difficulty intuitively because the system teaches me what normal looks like.

What truly sells me on this system is the Clocks. I have run sandbox games for years, and Clocks are the best tool I have seen for tracking off-screen developments. Faction projects, mounting threats, character goals - all of it becomes visible and manageable. The competing Clocks example in Chapter 9 (Evacuation vs. Flood Waters) perfectly illustrates how to create dynamic tension without scripting outcomes. This is exactly what a prepared sandbox needs: structures that generate emergent drama.

The Tags and Conditions system slots naturally into my GM toolkit. I already think in terms of environmental descriptors and character states; now I have a shared vocabulary with my players. When I describe a scene as having Dim Light and Cramped conditions, everyone at the table immediately understands the tactical implications. No negotiation required, no rulebook diving mid-scene.

The chapter organization rewards experienced GMs. Part I gives players what they need. Part III gives me what I need. The separation is clean and intentional. I can point new players at Chapters 1-13 and know they will get a coherent introduction. Then I can dive deep into the GM chapters without forcing them to wade through my prep tools.

Now let me address where my Power Gamer instincts push against the design.

Character optimization exists in this system, but it is constrained in ways that will frustrate min-maxers. The Attribute spread (2-1-1-0) is fixed at creation. Skills and Proficiencies are open-ended but their mechanical contribution is intentionally fuzzy. A player cannot build a character sheet that mechanically dominates without the GM's cooperation. This is by design - the system wants character capability to emerge from play rather than spreadsheet optimization.

As someone who enjoys finding efficient solutions within constraints, I appreciate that the Edge/Burden cap at plus or minus 2 prevents exploitation. You cannot stack infinite advantages. The system acknowledges that good positioning and clever preparation should matter, but it caps how much they can matter mechanically. This keeps the game playable for mixed groups where some players optimize harder than others.

The combat section is my primary concern for practical usability. The four core actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) are conceptually sound but lack the granularity that makes tactical combat engaging for players who enjoy that pillar of play. The Resolve Clock system is brilliant for cinematic fights but may frustrate players who want detailed combat as a minigame. I would want to establish house rules for specific Tag effects before running this system for a tactics-focused group.

The Skills and Proficiencies flexibility is double-edged. As a GM, I love that I can approve custom entries that fit my setting without balance concerns. As a player, I would feel uncertain about my character's actual capabilities until the first time each Skill comes up in play. The system trusts the table to negotiate these meanings, which requires a high-functioning group.

Genre flexibility is genuine and welcome. Chapter 5's discussion of different play modes (GM-led, duet, solo, GMless, asynchronous) shows that the designers thought carefully about how different groups actually play. The core mechanics do not assume combat fantasy; they work equally well for mystery, horror, slice-of-life, or science fiction. For a genre-agnostic GM like me, this is exactly what I want.

The abstract nature of the system rewards abstract thinking. You do not track encumbrance slots or ammunition counts unless you choose to. Position is narrative rather than grid-based. Time flows at story pace. If you think in concrete, tactical terms, this may feel imprecise. If you think in narrative beats and dramatic arcs, the system speaks your language.

Let me talk about what I would prep differently than with other systems.

Session prep focuses on situations rather than encounters. I would create Clocks for active threats and opportunities, Tag the key locations, and prep NPC motivations and capability profiles. I would not pre-plan combat statistics or detailed scene choreography. The system assumes I will improvise responses to player actions rather than anticipate them.

Campaign prep focuses on factions, fronts, and threads. Chapter 22 (Running Campaigns) and Chapter 25 (Factions, Fronts, and World Pressure) give me the tools I need to maintain a living world without drowning in preparation. The "world responds to character action" principle means I track consequences rather than script outcomes.

My prepared sandbox approach slots perfectly into this framework. I prep the pieces; the players decide what matters; the system helps us discover what happens. That is exactly the GM experience I want.

One structural note: Chapter 27 (Sheets and Play Aids) includes printable resources that would significantly help table usability. The sheet-block styling in the HTML output is smart design - compact, functional, and print-optimized. This is the kind of practical consideration that shows the designers actually run games.

Final thoughts from a Power Gamer perspective: this system rewards system mastery, but the mastery is procedural rather than numerical. Learning Razorweave means learning when to call for Checks, how to frame scenes that create interesting choices, and how to use Clocks to maintain pacing. The power is in understanding the flow of play, not in stacking modifiers. That is a different kind of optimization, and one I find intellectually satisfying.

The evangelical fiction-first in me wants to hand this book to every GM who has been frustrated by rules-heavy systems that bog down at the table. This is how you do narrative gaming with structure. This is how you maintain dramatic pacing while still giving players meaningful mechanical agency. This is the system I wish I had twenty years ago.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Combat actions lack specific mechanical values for Clock advancement. 'Significantly advance' on Full Success and 'still make progress' on Partial are narrative guidelines rather than rules. Tactical players will need house rules or extensive calibration.

**Impact:** Tables with mixed preferences (some narrative, some tactical) may struggle to find a consistent combat rhythm. GM burden increases when players expect predictable mechanical outcomes from combat actions.

**Location:** Chapter 10: Strike subsection, Resolve Clock discussion

### 2. Chapter 9: Tags and Conditions

**Issue:** Tag mechanical effects are described as possibilities ('might impose Burden,' 'might grant Edge') rather than defaults. While this supports flexibility, it requires active table negotiation that could slow early sessions.

**Impact:** First few sessions with a new group will involve frequent clarifications about what specific Tags do in specific situations. Eventually stabilizes through play, but initial friction is real.

**Location:** Chapter 9: What Tags Do, Common Tag Categories

### 3. Chapter 14-17: Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** The mechanical contribution of Skills to Checks is never explicitly stated. Examples show 4d6+Attribute but never 4d6+Attribute+Skill. This ambiguity is intentional but creates uncertainty during character creation.

**Impact:** Players cannot evaluate Skill choices based on mechanical contribution. They must trust that their choices will be validated through play. This requires faith in the GM that some players may not extend.

**Location:** Chapter 14: Skills and Attributes subsection, worked examples throughout book

### 4. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** The number of Skills and Proficiencies at creation is described as 'a small set' and 'a small number' without specific values. Different tables may interpret this very differently.

**Impact:** Characters created for the same campaign at different times may have incomparable capability levels. Tables need explicit house rules or a Session Zero calibration conversation.

**Location:** Chapter 6: Step Four (Choose Skills), Step Five (Choose Proficiencies)

### 5. Chapter 21-23: GM Chapters

**Issue:** The GM section is excellent but assumes significant GM experience. Specific procedures for common GM tasks (how to frame a scene, how to determine when a Clock advances) rely on intuition rather than explicit instruction.

**Impact:** New GMs may struggle to translate the principles into practice without mentorship or example transcripts. The system is learnable but not self-teaching for inexperienced GMs.

**Location:** Chapter 21: Running Sessions, Chapter 23: Designing Scenarios

### 6. Chapter 19: Advancement

**Issue:** Advancement pacing is described flexibly ('every 3-4 sessions' or 'at milestones') without a default recommendation. This is appropriate for different group styles but requires active GM decision-making.

**Impact:** GMs must make meta-decisions about pacing before play begins or risk inconsistent character growth. Not a flaw, but a responsibility that should be explicitly flagged.

**Location:** Chapter 19: Attribute Advancement, full chapter


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is an accomplished fiction-first RPG that successfully delivers on its design philosophy. The 4d6 core mechanic with Edge/Burden modifiers creates reliable probability curves. The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks framework provides powerful tools for tracking dynamic game state. The chapter organization serves both players and GMs with appropriate material in appropriate places.

From the perspective of a Power Gamer with extensive GM experience, I find this system intellectually satisfying. The optimization space is procedural and situational rather than numerical and static. Mastering Razorweave means mastering pacing, framing, and consequence - skills that transfer across genres and play styles.

As an evangelical fiction-first believer, I am delighted to find a system that commits to its principles without compromising playability. This is how narrative gaming should work: story drives mechanics, mechanics serve story, and the table shares authority over what matters.

My prepared sandbox approach maps directly onto the system's assumptions. I prep situations, factions, and Clocks; players drive the story; the system helps us discover outcomes together. This is exactly what I want from a core rulebook.

Ratings breakdown:
- Clarity & Readability (8/10): Excellent prose, logical organization, helpful examples. Some intentional ambiguity around mechanical contributions requires table calibration.
- Rules Accuracy (8/10): Internal consistency is strong. The rules that exist work as described. Some gaps exist by design.
- Persona Fit (9/10): This system serves my preferences exceptionally well. Fiction-first philosophy, genre flexibility, and sandbox-friendly tools align with how I want to play and run games.
- Practical Usability (7/10): Playable out of the box, but combat resolution and Skill mechanics benefit from house rules or explicit table agreements. The printable sheets help significantly.

I would recommend this system to GMs who want structure without restriction, to players who trust narrative emergence over mechanical certainty, and to tables that enjoy collaborative world-building. I would caution tactical combat enthusiasts that they may need supplemental rules for detailed fight sequences.

For my style of play, this is an excellent system that I am excited to bring to my table.
