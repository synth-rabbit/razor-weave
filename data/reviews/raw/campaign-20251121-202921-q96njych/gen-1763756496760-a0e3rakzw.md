## Narrative Feedback

After running games for more years than I care to count, finding a system that genuinely understands what makes sessions memorable is rare. Razorweave gets it. This is a rulebook that knows the best moments happen when players surprise each other, when the story takes unexpected turns, and when mechanics fade into the background to let the drama breathe.

The visual presentation immediately caught my eye - the color-coded boxes, the clean table layouts, the way important information stands out at a glance. As someone who often has a rulebook open while running, I can actually find what I need without breaking flow. The Table of Contents sidebar is brilliant - I can navigate while keeping my attention on my players.

The fiction-first approach feels native to how I've always wanted to run games. The Momentum system and the way Tags create emergent story hooks rather than just mechanical bonuses? That's exactly the vocabulary I've been teaching my groups for years, now codified in a way I can point to. The "Rules Exist to Serve the Fiction" principle in Chapter 4 should be mandatory reading for every game designer.

What really sings for collaborative storytelling is how the GM section is structured. It's not just "here's how to adjudicate rules" - it's "here's how to build stories together." The guidance on pacing scenes, managing spotlight distribution, and using clocks to create tension shows deep understanding of narrative craft.

I do wish the system were more tightly focused on its core identity rather than trying to accommodate multiple genres. The flexibility is admirable, but as someone who prefers focused systems, I sometimes felt the book trying to be everything to everyone. For my home games, I'll probably pare it down to the cyberpunk-narrative elements and ignore the more crunchy optional modules.

The example boxes are excellent - short, evocative, and showing exactly how fiction drives mechanics. Visual learners like me thrive on seeing concepts in action rather than reading abstract descriptions.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Character Creation (Chapter 6)

**Issue:** Visual flow diagram would enhance the step-by-step process

**Impact:** While the numbered steps are clear, a visual flowchart showing the creation process would help visual learners like me quickly orient new players. I find myself sketching these out for my groups anyway.

**Location:** ch-06-character-creation

### 2. GM Section - Running Sessions (Chapter 21)

**Issue:** Excellent collaborative guidance, but could use more visual scene structure tools

**Impact:** The advice is sound, but Forever GMs often think in terms of scene structure diagrams, relationship maps, and visual pacing tools. Including template sheets or visual aids would make this section even more practical.

**Location:** ch-21-running-sessions

### 3. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks (Chapter 9)

**Issue:** Clock visualization is good but could be more prominent

**Impact:** Clocks are fantastic narrative tools but the visual examples are somewhat small. As a visual learner and collaborative storyteller, I rely heavily on shared visual trackers - making these larger and more central would help.

**Location:** ch-09-tags-conditions-clocks

### 4. Setting and World (Chapters 22-25)

**Issue:** Genre breadth may dilute focused system appeal

**Impact:** While comprehensive, the multiple setting chapters make the book feel like it's trying to serve every genre. I prefer focused systems - a core setting with optional expansions would feel more cohesive to me.

**Location:** Part Four: The World of Razorweave

### 5. Reference Sheets (Appendix)

**Issue:** Visual reference sheets are good but could be better organized for at-table use

**Impact:** The sheets exist but feel like afterthoughts. As a Forever GM, I'd love a dedicated visual quick-reference section with relationship map templates, scene structure cards, and player-facing move summaries.

**Location:** ch-27-quick-reference-sheets


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is the rare rulebook that feels like it was written by someone who actually runs games at a table, not just designs them in theory. The fiction-first philosophy aligns perfectly with my collaborative storytelling approach, and the visual design respects the practical reality of actually using a rulebook during play.

For a Forever GM who values narrative tools over mechanical crunch, this is about as good as it gets in the modern RPG space. The Momentum system creates organic story beats, the Tag/Condition framework provides shared vocabulary without feeling restrictive, and the GM guidance focuses on facilitation rather than adjudication.

My main critique is that the book tries to be universal when it would shine brighter with more focus. The synthwave cyberpunk aesthetic is gorgeous and distinctive - lean into that rather than diluting it with "this also works for fantasy!" sections. Focused systems create stronger table experiences because everyone's on the same page.

The visual presentation is strong but could go further. More diagrams, relationship map templates, and scene structure aids would transform this from a great rulebook into an essential toolkit for visual-thinking GMs.

Final verdict: 8.5/10 for a Socializer Forever GM. This system understands that games are about the people at the table and the stories we create together. I'll be running this for my group - and I'll probably hack together some visual aids to supplement it, which is the highest compliment I can give a system.
