## Narrative Feedback

I need to be upfront about where I am coming from: I am a player who appreciates precision. When I sit down at a table, I want to know exactly what my character can do, what the odds are, and how the system will adjudicate my choices. I have been playing tactical games for nearly a decade, and I have developed an appreciation for systems that respect the player's need for concrete, reliable information.

The Razorweave Core Rulebook and I have a complicated relationship.

Let me start with what works. The 4d6 core mechanic is mathematically sound. Rolling 4d6 produces a bell curve centered around 14, with the vast majority of results falling between 10 and 18. The DC ladder (12-14-16-18-20-22) maps reasonably onto this distribution. Easy checks (DC 12) are achievable by nearly anyone, while Legendary checks (DC 22) require substantial bonuses and favorable dice. I ran the numbers, and the system holds together.

The Edge and Burden system is elegant in its simplicity. Rolling 5d6 and keeping the best 4 for +1 Edge, or 6d6k4 for +2 Edge, produces measurable statistical advantages without requiring complex modifier math. The cap at plus or minus 2 prevents runaway stacking while still making situational advantages meaningful. I appreciate that Edge and Burden cancel each other out before application, which prevents combinatorial explosion.

The outcome tier system is clear: Critical Success at margin +5 or greater, Full Success at margin 0 or greater, Partial Success at margin -1 to -2, Failure at margin -3 or lower, Critical Failure at margin -7 or lower or all 1s on the dice. This gives me five distinct bands to reason about, which is manageable.

Now for my frustrations.

The Attributes-to-Checks relationship is underspecified. The book says new characters have one Attribute at 2, two at 1, and one at 0. It says you add your Attribute rating to your 4d6 roll. But what about Skills? Chapter 14 says Skills "shape your approach" but is frustratingly vague about whether they provide numerical bonuses. The character creation chapter mentions choosing Skills but never specifies their mechanical weight. Am I adding Skill ranks? Is there a fixed bonus for having a relevant Skill? The text dances around this question without ever answering it directly.

This vagueness is intentional, I gather. The "fiction-first" philosophy means the GM decides what applies when, based on narrative context. But this leaves me, as a player, unable to calculate my actual chances on any given check. When I declare intent and approach, I cannot know whether my Stealth Skill will add +1, +2, or just give me narrative permission until the GM tells me. That uncertainty is uncomfortable for someone who wants to make informed tactical decisions.

The Proficiencies system compounds this problem. Chapter 16 describes Proficiencies as providing Edge, reducing DCs, or granting automatic success on routine tasks, but the application is entirely at GM discretion. "Telegraph Instruments" Proficiency might lower a DC by 2 in one scene and grant Edge in another, depending on interpretation. For a rules lawyer like me, this feels less like flexibility and more like unpredictability.

Combat, which is typically where I shine as a tactical player, feels underdeveloped. The four core actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) are described conceptually but without the mechanical precision I crave. What is the DC to hit an opponent in Solid Cover versus Fragile Cover? The book says Tags "might impose Burden" or "might grant Edge," but never commits to specific values for specific Tags. I want a table. Give me a table that says "Solid Cover: +2 to defender's DC or -1 Burden to attacker." Let me know what I am working with.

The Resolve Clock system replacing hit points is interesting conceptually but mechanically vague. How many segments does a Full Success on a Strike tick? The book says "significantly advance" on Full Success and "still make progress but at a cost" on Partial. That is narrative guidance, not mechanical specification. If I am building a combat-focused character, I need to know the expected number of successful Strikes to defeat a standard opponent. Without that information, I cannot evaluate whether investing in combat Skills is worthwhile.

The Clocks system generally suffers from this same imprecision. "Successful Checks tick the Clock forward" but by how many segments? One? Two? Based on margin? The Investigation and Cover-Up Clocks example does not specify. I end up asking the GM every single time, which slows play and removes my ability to strategize independently.

Let me be clear about what I am not criticizing. The writing is competent. The organization is logical. The examples help illustrate intent. The principles are internally consistent. This is not a poorly written book. It is a book written for players who are comfortable with GM adjudication filling gaps that I want rules to fill.

The Chapter 7 examples of Attribute Checks are the closest the book comes to giving me what I need: specific triggers, specific DCs, specific consequences. More of this throughout would dramatically improve my experience with this system.

Chapter 19's advancement system is appropriately flexible for long-term play, but again, the specific timing of when advancement happens is left entirely to group consensus. "Every 3-4 sessions" or "at milestones" or "through Downtime projects" are all mentioned as options without clear guidance on which to use when. I would prefer a default recommendation with explicit variant rules.

The Skills reference chapters (14-15) have the right structure with categories, descriptions, default actions, and DC ranges. But the DC ranges are broad ("DC 14-18") rather than specific to particular applications. The synergies and counters sections mention which Tags help or hinder, but not by how much.

I want to like this system. The core dice mechanic is solid. The concept of Tags, Conditions, and Clocks creating dynamic situations is appealing. The genre flexibility is genuinely useful. But every time I try to build a character or plan a tactical approach, I hit walls of "ask your GM" that prevent me from engaging with the system on my terms.

If you are a player who enjoys narrative emergence and trusts your GM to make fair calls in the moment, this system will probably serve you well. If, like me, you prefer to understand the exact mechanical landscape before making decisions, you will find Razorweave frustrating in its deliberate ambiguity.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 14: Skills System Overview

**Issue:** Skills are described as shaping approach and being 'used directly in Checks' but their specific mechanical contribution is never quantified. Do Skills provide flat bonuses? Conditional bonuses? Only narrative permission?

**Impact:** Players cannot calculate their actual check probabilities before rolling. Character building becomes guesswork about which Skills will be mechanically valuable versus merely narrative.

**Location:** Chapter 14: Skills and Attributes subsection, and throughout Chapters 14-15

### 2. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Core combat actions lack specific mechanical outcomes. How many Clock segments does a Full Success Strike tick? What DC modifiers do specific Tags apply? The four-action framework is described narratively but not mechanically codified.

**Impact:** Tactical players cannot build effective combat characters or plan combat approaches without extensive GM negotiation. Combat becomes more GM-dependent than other resolution types.

**Location:** Chapter 10: Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw subsections

### 3. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Tags are described as providing Edge, Burden, or DC modification, but specific Tags are not mapped to specific mechanical effects. 'Dim Light might impose Burden' is not a rule; it is a suggestion.

**Impact:** Players cannot reliably predict how environmental or situational Tags will affect their Checks. Same-named Tags may have different effects across tables or even across scenes at the same table.

**Location:** Chapter 9: What Tags Do; Common Tag Categories

### 4. Chapter 16-17: Proficiencies

**Issue:** Proficiencies provide variable benefits (Edge, DC reduction, automatic success) based entirely on GM interpretation. No baseline mechanical effect is specified for having a relevant Proficiency.

**Impact:** Players cannot evaluate Proficiency choices during character creation because their value depends on future GM rulings. What seems like a useful Proficiency might rarely apply mechanically.

**Location:** Chapter 16: When Proficiencies Apply; Chapter 17 throughout

### 5. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The margin-to-outcome mapping is clear, but the book never specifies whether Skills add numerical bonuses to rolls. The example rolls show '4d6+Attribute' but not '+Skill' despite Skills supposedly being used 'directly in Checks.'

**Impact:** Core resolution procedure has an ambiguous term. Players cannot know their total modifier without asking GM whether and how much their Skill contributes.

**Location:** Chapter 8: Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin; worked examples throughout

### 6. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Character creation instructs players to choose Skills and Proficiencies but provides no point-buy budget, no mechanical weight comparison, and no guidance on how many of each to select ('a small set').

**Impact:** New players have no framework for making balanced or effective choices. 'Small set' could mean 3 or 8 depending on table interpretation.

**Location:** Chapter 6: Step Four (Choose Skills), Step Five (Choose Proficiencies)

### 7. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long Term Growth

**Issue:** Attribute caps are described as 'soft' and advancement pacing as 'flexible' with no default values. 'Most characters will not exceed +3' is guidance, not a rule.

**Impact:** Long-term character progression is unpredictable. Players cannot plan advancement paths or compare characters across campaigns without table-specific agreements.

**Location:** Chapter 19: Attribute Advancement subsection


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook presents a coherent fiction-first RPG framework with a mathematically sound 4d6 core mechanic. The Edge/Burden system for situational modifiers is elegantly designed, and the Tags/Conditions/Clocks framework provides useful tools for tracking dynamic situations.

However, from the perspective of a tactically-minded player who values mechanical precision, the system has significant gaps. Skills and Proficiencies lack defined numerical contributions. Tags have variable effects based on GM interpretation. Combat actions describe narrative outcomes without specifying mechanical values. The deliberately open-ended approach that fiction-first enthusiasts might praise reads, to me, as incomplete specification.

I rate Clarity and Readability at 7/10 because the prose is clear and well-organized, but key mechanical questions remain unanswered. Rules Accuracy receives 6/10: the rules that exist are internally consistent, but too many interactions are left to interpretation rather than codified. Persona Fit is 5/10 because this system fundamentally does not serve players who want to calculate odds and optimize approaches. Practical Usability is 6/10: I could play this game, but I would spend significant time negotiating mechanical interpretations that other systems resolve in their text.

The system's target audience clearly excludes players like me who prefer mechanical determinism. That is a valid design choice, but it means I cannot recommend this book to fellow tactical players without the significant caveat that they will need to accept GM authority over many resolution details.

For tables that share a high-trust relationship and prefer narrative emergence over calculated outcomes, Razorweave may be excellent. For rules lawyers who want to know exactly what their character sheet means mechanically, this book will be a source of ongoing frustration.

Final assessment: A well-crafted fiction-first system that deliberately trades mechanical precision for narrative flexibility. Whether that trade-off works for you depends entirely on what you want from an RPG.
