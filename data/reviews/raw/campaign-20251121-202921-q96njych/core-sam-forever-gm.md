## Narrative Feedback

After decades behind the screen running everything from dungeon crawls to cosmic horror to cozy village mysteries, I know a well-designed GM toolkit when I see one. Razorweave doesn't just give us tools - it articulates the philosophy behind why those tools work and when to reach for them. That's rare and valuable.

The fiction-first approach here isn't some indie game marketing buzzword. It's a genuine design principle that runs through every chapter. The three-question test for when to call for a Check (uncertainty, consequence, agency) is exactly the heuristic I've internalized over years of running games, now codified in a way I can teach to newer GMs at my table. The "ask first, then roll" guidance in Chapter 21 should be tattooed on every GM screen.

What strikes me as a systems integrator is how elegantly the mechanical pieces interconnect. Attributes flow into Skills flow into Proficiencies, with Tags and Conditions layering narrative weight on top, and Clocks tracking everything from personal injury to faction movements to world-scale events. Each system references and reinforces the others without creating circular dependencies or complexity spirals. You can understand each piece independently, but they become more powerful together.

The DC ladder and outcome tiers are beautifully calibrated. The explicit guidance about when Partial Success means "success with cost" versus "partial achievement" gives me as GM the flexibility I need to match outcomes to the fiction. And the advice about using Tags to justify Edge or Burden rather than hunting for numeric modifiers keeps the focus where it belongs.

Chapter 21 (Running Sessions) feels like a letter written to me personally. The session agenda structure, the advice about scene framing with Tags and Clocks, the guidance on pacing and spotlight rotation - this is battle-tested wisdom distilled into teachable principles. I especially appreciate the emphasis on ending sessions cleanly with Clock and Tag review; that's a habit I had to learn through painful experience.

The genre flexibility is exactly what I need. I run different campaigns for different groups - sometimes gothic horror, sometimes space opera, sometimes cozy slice-of-life - and Razorweave's abstract framework adapts to all of them. The Tags system means I can model any environment, any social dynamic, any source of pressure without inventing new subsystems for each setting.

The Proficiencies chapter crystallizes something I've always believed: expertise should be about narrative permission and domain knowledge, not just numeric bonuses. The guidance about treating Proficiencies as "permission first and bonus second" is exactly right.

If I have concerns, they center on areas where the book's flexibility becomes ambiguity. The combat chapter, while mechanically sound, could use more worked examples of complex multi-phase encounters. The advancement system in Chapter 19, while flexible, leaves me wanting more concrete pacing benchmarks for different campaign lengths. And the NPC-to-VPC promotion criteria could be clearer for GMs who haven't already developed instincts about companion character management.

But these are refinements to an already excellent foundation. This is a system I will run, not just read and appreciate.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Limited tactical complexity guidance for experienced GMs

**Impact:** Combat-heavy campaigns lack worked examples of multi-phase encounters, terrain-rich battlefields, or large-scale conflicts. The four-action framework is clear for simple scenes, but scaling to complex tactical situations requires significant GM extrapolation.

**Location:** Chapter 10, throughout - particularly the 'Putting It Together' section

### 2. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long-Term Growth

**Issue:** Missing pacing benchmarks for different campaign structures

**Impact:** New GMs using this system may struggle to calibrate advancement frequency. A 10-session arc needs different pacing than a 50-session campaign, but the chapter doesn't provide concrete recommendations for either.

**Location:** Chapter 19, Milestones and Growth section

### 3. Chapter 24: NPCs, VPCs, and Enemies

**Issue:** Unclear criteria for NPC-to-VPC promotion

**Impact:** When should a recurring helpful NPC be formalized as a VPC with their own Tags, Conditions, and spotlight time? The distinction matters for party dynamics and narrative focus, but the transition criteria are implicit rather than explicit.

**Location:** Chapter 24, VPC Roles subsection

### 4. Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Duplicate 'Example' labels in example boxes

**Impact:** Minor presentation issue - example boxes show 'Example Example' pattern due to formatting inconsistency. Does not affect comprehension but creates visual noise.

**Location:** Multiple example boxes throughout Chapter 4

### 5. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Typo: 'Manege position' should be 'Manage position'

**Impact:** Minor typo that does not impede understanding but should be corrected for professional polish.

**Location:** Positioning and Environment section


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is an outstanding piece of game design that speaks directly to experienced, genre-flexible, collaborative GMs. Its fiction-first philosophy is articulated with clarity and backed by practical tools that actually work at the table.

For Forever GMs like me, this book offers both validation and education. The Running Sessions chapter crystallizes practices I've developed through years of trial and error into teachable principles. The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks system provides exactly the kind of flexible narrative infrastructure I need to run multiple genres without learning new mechanical subsystems for each campaign.

The system's greatest strength is its elegant interconnection. Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks form a coherent framework where each piece supports the others. As a systems integrator, I find this architecture deeply satisfying - you can understand each component independently, but mastery comes from seeing how they combine.

The issues I've noted are refinements, not fundamental problems. More worked combat examples, clearer advancement pacing, and explicit VPC promotion criteria would help newer GMs, but experienced Forever GMs will fill these gaps intuitively. The flexibility that creates these ambiguities is also what makes the system so adaptable across genres and play styles.

I would enthusiastically recommend this book to:
- GMs who run multiple campaigns across different genres and want a portable system
- Tables that value collaborative storytelling and fiction-first play
- Experienced GMs looking for codified wisdom they can share with their players
- Anyone tired of systems that prioritize mechanical simulation over narrative momentum

This is not just a book I will read and appreciate - it's a system I will run for years to come.

Final Rating: 8.5/10 - A thoughtful, well-designed system that immediately earns a place in any Forever GM's toolkit.
