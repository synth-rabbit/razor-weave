## Narrative Feedback

As someone who both runs and plays games, I approach new systems looking for the intersection of exploration potential and mechanical clarity. Razorweave presents an intriguing tension here - it promises genre flexibility and discovery while maintaining structural coherence. Let me dig into how well it delivers.

The core resolution system (4d6, compare to DC, determine margin) is elegantly simple and I appreciate that. The outcome tiers are clearly defined: Critical Success at margin +5 or higher, Full Success at 0+, Partial at -1 to -2, Failure at -3 or below, Critical Failure at -7 or all 1s. These concrete numbers are exactly what I need when preparing sandbox scenarios - I can pre-calculate probability curves and design encounters with specific tension points in mind.

However, as someone who Needs Concrete Numbers, I found myself wanting more precision in several areas. The Edge/Burden system caps at +/-2, which is clean, but the text is occasionally vague about exactly when these apply. The guidance says Tags "typically" grant Edge or Burden - but which Tags specifically? The GM section suggests starting small, but I'd appreciate a cleaner mapping for my prep work.

The DC ladder (12-Easy, 14-Routine, 16-Tough, 18-Hard, 20-Heroic, 22-Legendary) is solid reference material. I've already bookmarked this for quick access during sessions. But the guidance on setting DCs feels more impressionistic than I'd prefer. When should I adjust the DC versus applying Edge/Burden? The book suggests both are valid approaches but doesn't give clear criteria for choosing between them.

Character creation through the nine-step process works well for my Prepared Sandbox approach. I can build meaningful NPCs and VPCs using the same framework I'd use for PCs, which maintains system coherence. The Attribute spread (2/1/1/0) and flexible Skill/Proficiency system let me create varied opposition without getting bogged down in statblock minutiae.

The Resolve Clock system for combat is interesting from an exploration standpoint - it allows fights to end in different ways depending on the stakes agreed upon beforehand. But here's where my Systems Integrator brain wants more: how do different segment counts actually affect pacing? A 6-segment clock versus a 4-segment clock - what's the practical difference in round count expectations? The book mentions sizing clocks to the scene but doesn't give mathematical guidance.

For exploring unfamiliar territories (new settings, genres, tones), the Tags and Conditions system is genuinely helpful. I can create environmental Tags that define a location's exploratory challenges, and these naturally integrate with the resolution system. This is the kind of systemic coherence I look for.

What I particularly appreciate as a hybrid GM/Player is how the combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) aren't mechanically distinct subsystems - they're the same resolution procedure applied to different fictional positioning. This means I can prep complex scenarios without memorizing special case rules, and players can intuitively understand their options.

The "When to Roll" criteria (Uncertainty, Consequence, Agency) is excellent guidance that will reduce unnecessary dice rolls at my table. I've already internalized this as a GM checklist.

My curiosity is particularly piqued by the Clocks system for long-term goals and mounting threats. The racing Clocks concept (Evacuation vs. Flood, Investigation vs. Cover-Up) creates organic tension structures I can pre-design during sandbox prep. But I wish the book provided more worked examples with actual numbers - how many successes typically fill different Clock sizes?

Overall, this is a system I can work with, but I'll need to build my own reference sheets to fill in the numerical gaps the book leaves open.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The relationship between DC adjustment and Edge/Burden application is unclear. Both are presented as valid approaches to representing circumstance, but no criteria are given for choosing between them.

**Impact:** Medium - creates uncertainty for GMs who want to apply modifiers consistently during prep

**Location:** Chapter 8, Setting DCs and Edge/Burden sections (lines 64-96)

### 2. Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Tags are described as 'typically' granting Edge/Burden or affecting DCs, but specific mappings are deferred to Chapter 18. This creates a forward reference gap that interrupts systematic understanding.

**Impact:** Medium - requires flipping between chapters to build complete mental model

**Location:** Chapter 9, What Tags Do section (lines 22-32)

### 3. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock sizing guidance lacks mathematical specificity. The book mentions '2-3 segments for quick threats, more for major foes' but doesn't correlate segment count to expected round count or success probability.

**Impact:** Medium - GMs who want to design encounters with specific pacing cannot easily calculate outcomes

**Location:** Chapter 10, Resolve Instead of Hit Points section (lines 39-55)

### 4. Chapter 9 - Clocks

**Issue:** The Clock advancement mechanics don't specify expected tick rates. How many segments should a 'typical' successful Check advance? The book mentions 'exceptional successes may jump' but doesn't define what constitutes exceptional.

**Impact:** Medium-High - Clocks are central to the system but their pacing math is undefined

**Location:** Chapter 9, Advancing Clocks section (lines 133-143)

### 5. Chapter 6 - Character Creation

**Issue:** The Proficiency system's mechanical impact is deliberately vague ('influence difficulty, consequences, and access') but this creates prep uncertainty. When exactly does a Proficiency reduce DC versus grant Edge versus remove the need for a roll entirely?

**Impact:** Medium - affects both character build choices and GM adjudication consistency

**Location:** Chapter 6, Step Five - Choose Proficiencies (lines 151-173)

### 6. Chapter 8 - Example Boxes

**Issue:** Duplicate '**Example**' labels appear in some example boxes, creating '> **Example** > **Example**' patterns

**Impact:** Low - cosmetic issue that creates visual noise but content remains clear

**Location:** Multiple locations in Chapter 8 (lines 23-24, 55-56, 131-132, 166-167, 183-184)

## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook presents a mechanically coherent system that successfully balances narrative flexibility with structural consistency. As an Explorer who operates in both GM and Player roles, I find the core resolution elegant and the Tag/Condition/Clock framework genuinely useful for creating discoverable environments.

The system's greatest strength is its unified resolution approach - whether you're making a social Check, attempting a combat Strike, or advancing a long-term Clock, the fundamental procedure remains consistent. This is exactly what a Systems Integrator wants to see: learn one loop, apply it everywhere.

For my Prepared Sandbox GM style, the system provides good scaffolding. The nine-step character creation works for both PCs and significant NPCs, the DC ladder gives me reference points for encounter design, and Clocks let me structure competing pressures without railroading outcomes.

However, as someone who Needs Concrete Numbers, I found several areas where the book trades precision for flexibility in ways that will require me to develop my own house rules or reference charts:

1. Edge/Burden vs. DC adjustment criteria remain undefined
2. Clock pacing lacks mathematical grounding
3. Proficiency effects on resolution are deliberately open-ended
4. Tag-to-modifier mappings are scattered rather than consolidated

These aren't dealbreakers - the system is playable as written. But they represent gaps between the fiction-first philosophy and the concrete numerical scaffolding I prefer for prep work.

My curiosity about the system's deeper interactions (how do multiple Clocks interact? what's the optimal ratio of Set Ups to Strikes against tough opponents?) will require actual play to answer, since the book provides principles rather than formulas.

Rating Summary:
- Clarity & Readability: 8/10 - Well-organized with clear prose, though some forward references interrupt flow
- Rules Accuracy: 7/10 - Internally consistent but several mechanical details are deliberately left open
- Persona Fit: 7/10 - Good for exploratory play, but lacks the numerical precision I prefer for prep
- Practical Usability: 6/10 - Will require building supplementary reference materials for table use
