## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has spent countless sessions optimizing character builds and mastering mechanical interactions while simultaneously running games for decades, I approach every new system with a specific question: where are the leverage points? How can I extract maximum narrative and mechanical advantage from the tools provided? Razorweave presents an interesting challenge because its fiction-first philosophy means the leverage points are different from what I typically seek.

The 4d6 with Edge/Burden system is elegant but lacks the granular optimization I instinctively crave. The cap at +2/-2 Edge/Burden feels intentionally flat - it prevents the kind of stacking synergies that make power-gaming satisfying. That said, I recognize this is a deliberate design choice that keeps the math bounded and the focus on narrative positioning rather than modifier hunting. As a Forever GM, I appreciate that this makes balance trivially achievable at my table.

The Character Creation chapter offers more optimization space than it first appears. The open-ended Skill and Proficiency lists mean a clever player can define capabilities that touch multiple Attribute domains. The Proficiency system in particular rewards careful conceptual positioning - a well-defined Proficiency like "Crisis Negotiations" or "Unstable Systems Engineering" creates narrative permission across many situations. However, the GM final-approval caveat means my optimization here depends entirely on table negotiation rather than RAW exploitation.

Chapter 26 on Alternative Play speaks directly to my GMless advocacy. The shared authority principles are sound, and the rotating facilitator structure provides the procedural scaffolding needed for distributed authority. But I want more. The Oracle guidance for solo and GMless play is thin - just "Yes/No/Complication" prompts. Where are the detailed procedures for faction turns? For threat generation? For world-move cycles? A serious GMless campaign needs more mechanical backbone than this chapter provides.

Combat optimization is constrained by the Resolve Clock system. I can see the paths: stack Set Ups to create compounding Edge, use Maneuvers to apply Conditions that create Burden on enemy defenses, coordinate with allies to tick Clocks rapidly. But the system resists the kind of nova-round alpha-strike patterns that reward careful resource management in other systems. Resolve Clocks make fights about momentum and positioning rather than damage spikes. Tactically interesting but different from my usual approach.

The DC ladder concerns me from a balance perspective. DC 12-22 is a narrow band, and the 4d6 curve (average 14) means the difference between "Easy" and "Heroic" is only a few points of probability shift. This keeps the game dramatic but also means player investment in optimization provides diminishing returns. My cautious side appreciates the stability; my power-gaming side wishes for more room to create meaningful mechanical advantages.

Tags and Conditions are where I find my groove. These are the system's true optimization vectors - narrative positioning that creates mechanical consequences. A character who consistently creates useful Tags (marking enemies, establishing cover, applying situational modifiers) can significantly influence outcomes without any numeric stacking. This rewards system mastery but through fiction-first channels rather than character-build choices.

The system is focused and cohesive, which I value. There are no vestigial subsystems, no bolted-on mechanics that break the core loop. But that focus also means limited customization depth. I wish for optional modules that add complexity layers for tables that want them - equipment with mechanical weight, advancement paths with meaningful branches, faction systems with crunchier resolution.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 26: Alternative Play

**Issue:** Insufficient procedural depth for GMless play

**Impact:** The GMless guidance provides principles and a rotating facilitator structure but lacks the detailed procedures needed for sustained shared-authority campaigns. Missing: faction turn mechanics, threat generation procedures, world-move cycles, and structured oracle systems. GMless advocates will need to import procedures from other games or develop their own.

**Location:** Chapter 26, GMless Procedures subsection - entire section needs expansion

### 2. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Edge/Burden cap limits optimization expression

**Impact:** The hard cap at +2/-2 Edge/Burden is intentionally anti-optimization, preventing the kind of stacking synergies that reward system mastery. While this creates bounded math, it also reduces the mechanical payoff for clever positioning. Power gamers will find limited room for mechanical expression.

**Location:** Chapter 8, Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions section

### 3. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Open-ended Skills and Proficiencies depend on GM negotiation

**Impact:** The system's flexibility is also its optimization weakness. Without fixed lists, character build optimization becomes entirely table-dependent. Two different GMs might approve wildly different scopes for the same proposed Proficiency, making cross-table character optimization impossible.

**Location:** Chapter 6, Step Four and Step Five - particularly the GM approval guidance

### 4. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clocks flatten damage optimization

**Impact:** The Resolve Clock system removes traditional damage-per-round calculations from combat optimization. While this creates narrative fights focused on momentum, it eliminates the satisfaction of building high-damage characters. Combat optimization shifts entirely to tactical positioning and Condition application.

**Location:** Chapter 10, Resolve Instead of Hit Points section

### 5. Chapter 20: Optional and Variant Rules

**Issue:** Variant rules lack mechanical depth for complexity-seeking tables

**Impact:** The optional rules are mostly pacing dials and narrative authority variants rather than mechanical depth additions. Missing: equipment systems with mechanical weight, detailed faction rules, crunchier advancement paths. Tables wanting more complexity must create their own supplements.

**Location:** Chapter 20, entire chapter - notably absent are mechanical complexity variants

### 6. Chapter 26: Alternative Play

**Issue:** Solo play VPC guidance assumes GM-like intuition

**Impact:** The VPC companion guidance for solo play assumes players can make GM-style judgments about NPC behavior and threat generation. For players without Forever GM experience, this creates a gap. More structured VPC behavior procedures would help.

**Location:** Chapter 26, Solo Play with VPC Companions section


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave Core Rulebook is a competent fiction-first system that deliberately trades mechanical optimization depth for narrative flexibility and bounded math. For power gamers coming from crunchier systems, this represents a significant paradigm shift.

The system's strengths align partially with my priorities:
- Focused design without vestigial subsystems (excellent)
- Narrative tools through Tags and Conditions (rewarding different optimization)
- GMless/shared authority support in Chapter 26 (present but underdeveloped)
- Stable, predictable math that makes running games easy (Forever GM approved)

The system's weaknesses are significant for my playstyle:
- Edge/Burden caps prevent stacking synergies
- Open-ended character creation depends on GM negotiation
- Resolve Clocks eliminate damage optimization
- GMless procedures lack the detail needed for sustained play
- No optional modules for tables wanting mechanical complexity

As a cautious player and Forever GM, I appreciate the system's stability and predictability. The bounded math means I can run this without spreadsheets and my players cannot accidentally break encounters. But as a power gamer, I find limited room for the kind of character build optimization and mechanical mastery that I typically pursue.

The Persona Fit rating of 7 reflects this tension. Razorweave serves my Forever GM needs well but frustrates my power-gaming instincts. The fiction-first framework means optimization happens through narrative positioning rather than mechanical choices, which requires a different skillset than I typically deploy.

I would run this system for tables that want collaborative storytelling with light mechanical support. I would not bring it to my regular optimization-focused group unless they were explicitly seeking a different experience.

For GMless advocacy specifically: Chapter 26 is a starting point, not a destination. Serious shared-authority play will require importing procedures from dedicated GMless games or developing house rules. The foundation is compatible but incomplete.

Final recommendation: Good for narrative tables, adequate for Forever GMs, limited for power gamers, promising but underdeveloped for GMless play.
