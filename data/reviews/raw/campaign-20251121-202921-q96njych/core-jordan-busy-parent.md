## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so here is the thing - I have maybe an hour or two a week to prep for game night, and that is on a good week when the kids actually go to bed on time. So when I opened up this Razorweave rulebook, my honest first reaction was: "Wow, this is a lot to take in."

**What Works For Me:**

The "fiction first" approach is actually perfect for my situation. I do not have time to memorize elaborate rule systems, so a game that says "describe what happens naturally, then reach for dice only when things are uncertain" is exactly what I need. When I am exhausted and cannot remember specific rules, I can just make a reasonable call and keep the story moving. That flexibility is gold.

The core resolution system is surprisingly simple once you get it: roll 4d6, add your Attribute, compare to a target number (DC 12 for Easy up to DC 22 for Legendary). The outcome tiers - Critical Success, Full Success, Partial Success, Failure, Critical Failure - are intuitive. I got this down after reading it twice, which is about all the focused reading time I can manage.

I really appreciate the worked examples throughout the book. Every time a concept confused me, there was a boxed example showing how it plays out at the table. The character creation example with Rella helped me understand the flow without having to visualize everything from scratch.

**Where It Gets Challenging:**

This book has 30 chapters. Thirty. That is intimidating when you are already juggling work, kids, household duties, and trying to have some kind of social life. I really wish there was a 3-5 page "Start Here" quick reference at the front that tells me exactly what I need to know for my first session.

Character creation has nine steps. Nine! I love that the system is thorough, but when I am trying to help my game group make characters in our limited time together, nine steps feels overwhelming. What I really want is 4-6 pre-made characters I can hand out and say "pick one, let us play."

The Edge and Burden system (rolling extra dice and keeping the best or worst 4) is clever but adds mental overhead. When I am running a game while half-listening for whether a kid woke up, trying to remember to add or remove dice based on Tags and Conditions is asking a lot. It is elegant on paper, but in practice it is one more thing to track.

The Combat chapter explains the Resolve Clock system instead of hit points, and while I appreciate the design thinking, it took me several reads to fully understand how it works. I am a visual person - a simple flowchart showing "attack happens -> roll Check -> tick Clock -> check if full" would have saved me twenty minutes of re-reading.

The Skills and Proficiencies reference chapters (14-17) are comprehensive but dense. Looking up whether a specific action is covered requires reading through detailed prose entries rather than scanning a simple list. When I am in the middle of running a session, I need faster lookups.

**My Survival Strategy:**

I am going to lean hard into the fiction-first philosophy. If I do not know a specific rule, I will make a reasonable judgment call, keep the game moving, and look it up later (probably never). The system seems forgiving enough that improv decisions will not break anything.

I have got Chapters 8 (Actions and Checks) and 9 (Tags, Conditions, Clocks) bookmarked as my go-to references. Everything else I will learn as situations come up in actual play.

For other busy parents out there: read the first five chapters to get the philosophy, skim Chapter 6 for character creation basics, learn the Check procedure from Chapter 8, and then just start playing. You will figure out the rest as you go, and honestly that is more fun anyway.

**Bottom Line:**

Good game design, needs a "busy person mode" for people like me who cannot commit hours to rulebook study. The foundation is solid and the rules are internally consistent - I can tell careful thought went into this. But the accessibility for time-constrained casual gamers like me needs work.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Book Structure

**Issue:** No quick-start guide or condensed summary for time-limited readers

**Impact:** Busy parents and casual gamers face a 30-chapter book without clear guidance on what to prioritize. This can delay first sessions significantly or lead to skipping the book entirely and learning only through trial and error.

**Location:** Front matter / Part I - no quick-start section exists

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Nine-step character creation process is thorough but time-consuming for constrained game sessions

**Impact:** Groups with limited session time may not complete character creation in one sitting, potentially delaying actual play by a week or more. The worked Rella example helps but does not replace pre-generated options.

**Location:** Chapter 6, The Creation Flow section listing Steps One through Nine

### 3. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock combat system lacks a visual quick-reference diagram or flowchart

**Impact:** GMs running their first combat must mentally translate prose descriptions into procedure while managing players, slowing down play and increasing cognitive load during already demanding scenes.

**Location:** Chapter 10, Resolve Instead of Hit Points and Putting It Together sections

### 4. Book Structure

**Issue:** No pre-generated characters or ready-to-play character templates provided

**Impact:** Groups cannot jump into play immediately. Even with the Rella example, creating characters from scratch requires significant time investment that casual groups may not have.

**Location:** Character Creation chapter and Appendix materials

### 5. Chapter 8: Edge and Burden System

**Issue:** Rolling extra dice and tracking modifiers adds cognitive overhead during play

**Impact:** While elegant mechanically, the Edge/Burden system requires remembering to adjust dice count based on multiple sources (Tags, Conditions, Proficiencies), which is challenging when managing distractions during casual game nights.

**Location:** Chapter 8, Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions section

### 6. Chapters 14-17: Skills and Proficiencies Reference

**Issue:** Reference chapters use detailed prose entries rather than scannable lists or tables

**Impact:** Mid-session lookups require reading through descriptive paragraphs rather than quickly finding relevant information, slowing down play when clarification is needed.

**Location:** Chapters 14-17, all Skills and Proficiencies reference material


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a thoughtfully designed system with elegant mechanics and a philosophy I genuinely appreciate. The fiction-first approach, unified resolution system, and Tags/Conditions/Clocks framework show careful game design thinking.

The rules themselves are accurate and internally consistent. When I can sit down and actually read through sections carefully, the logic is clear and the examples are helpful. The system does what it says it will do.

But I am a busy parent with limited time and attention. What I need is a system I can pick up quickly, reference easily mid-session (often while half-distracted), and run confidently without extensive preparation.

Razorweave in its current form asks for more time investment than I can easily give. The 30-chapter structure, nine-step character creation, and prose-heavy reference sections are all barriers for casual, time-constrained players like me.

What would make this a 9/10 for my situation:
- A 3-5 page Quick Start guide at the front of the book
- 4-6 pre-generated characters ready for immediate play
- Visual flowcharts for combat and Check procedures
- A one-page rules summary reference card

As it stands, I will make it work by relying on fiction-first improvisation and learning rules incrementally through play. The system is forgiving enough to support that approach.

I am rating Clarity & Readability at 7/10 because the writing is clear when you have time to read it, but information architecture could better serve quick reference. Rules Accuracy gets 8/10 because the mechanics are consistent and logical. Persona Fit is 6/10 because the system's flexibility suits my needs but the time investment does not match my constraints. Practical Usability is 5/10 because actual at-the-table use requires more preparation and lookup time than my schedule allows.

The game underneath is good. The presentation just needs to better accommodate players who cannot treat rulebook study as a hobby in itself.
