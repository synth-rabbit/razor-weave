## Narrative Feedback

Alright, let me walk through this from the perspective of someone who has spent years figuring out how to make TTRPGs work at a table of one. I have run solo campaigns through Ironsworn, Mythic GM Emulator layered over various systems, and more journaling games than I can count. When I crack open a new rulebook, my first question is always: can I actually use this alone?

Razorweave presents an interesting case study. The fiction-first philosophy immediately appeals to how I play. When you are the only person at the table, everything runs through narrative anyway. There is no GM to tell you what happens; you are constantly in dialogue with yourself, the fiction, and whatever randomization tools you bring. A system that privileges "what makes sense in the story" over "what do the rules prescribe" feels like it was designed with solo play in mind, even when it was not.

The 4d6 core mechanic is elegant. I ran some test rolls across various scenarios, and the five outcome tiers (Critical Success, Success, Partial Success, Failure, Critical Failure) give me enough granularity to drive narrative forward without constant table lookups. The Partial Success band is particularly valuable for solo play. It creates complications organically. When you roll a -1 to -2, you know something went sideways, and the fiction tells you what. That is exactly the kind of emergent complication that makes solo play interesting.

Clocks are a revelation for solo play. I cannot overstate how valuable these are. When I play alone, I need mechanisms that push back against my narrative tendency to make things work out. Clocks do this beautifully. A six-segment "Corporate Security Alert" Clock does not care that I am having fun exploring this server room. It ticks. The pressure is real. I have adapted Clock-like mechanisms from Blades in the Dark for years, so seeing them integrated natively here is excellent.

Tags give me a mechanical vocabulary for scene-setting that has actual teeth. "Dim Light" is not just flavor; it means something in the resolution system. "Exposed Position" creates real consequences. This is the kind of environmental storytelling that solo play thrives on.

Now for where things get complicated.

The book's "Alternative Play" chapter (Chapter 26) acknowledges solo play exists but treats it as an afterthought. The guidance is high-level at best: "consider using oracle tables," "adapt the GM role to your own judgment." This is not helpful for me, and it certainly is not helpful for someone new to solo play trying to figure out where to start.

Where are the oracle tables? Where is the procedural guidance for self-adjudicating Checks? When I play solo, I need clear criteria for when to roll versus when to narrate. The book assumes someone calls for a Check. In solo play, I am that someone, and the temptation to either over-roll (killing narrative momentum) or under-roll (avoiding uncertainty I should face) is real.

The Proficiencies system is elegant for group play but creates a self-adjudication problem for solo. Proficiencies grant Edge or lower DCs when your background applies, but deciding when your background applies requires interpretation. In group play, you pitch to the GM. Playing solo, I am pitching to myself, and I am a very sympathetic audience. The book provides no guidance on how to fairly arbitrate these decisions alone.

VPCs (Important NPCs) have tactical instructions that assume GM operation. Running adversaries against yourself is a fundamental solo play challenge, and Razorweave provides no framework for it. How do I decide what a VPC does when I am both the player wanting them to fail and the world needing them to act intelligently? This is solvable, but I have to solve it myself.

Character creation encourages collaborative definition of Skills and Proficiencies. For solo players, there are no pre-built lists to select from; everything requires the creative negotiation the book assumes happens with a GM. I spent twice as long building my test character as I would have with a more structured system because every custom element was me negotiating with myself.

What works despite these limitations:

The chapter structure is excellent for reference during play. Clear headings, logical organization, good examples. When I needed to look up how Conditions work mid-scene, I found it quickly.

The genre-agnostic design means I can explore freely. I ran test scenes in cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, and weird fiction settings using the same character concept. The system did not fight me on any of them.

The core resolution is fast enough that it does not interrupt narrative flow. Roll 4d6, check the spread, interpret the result, continue. No subsystem lookups, no chart cross-referencing.

The Injury and Wounds track is satisfying. Stakes feel real when my character accumulates Conditions that persist and complicate future actions.

What I actually did during testing:

I imported oracle techniques from Mythic (yes/no with modifiers, scene alteration rolls) and layered them over Razorweave's resolution. Ask the oracle for fictional details, use 4d6 for action resolution. This hybrid works, but it requires bringing external tools the book does not provide or reference.

For enemy behavior, I used a simple heuristic: "what would a competent adversary do given the current situation?" and then rolled to see if they executed competently. Again, house rules built on the fly.

For Clock advancement, I ticked on scene transitions and Partial Successes. This created natural pressure without requiring me to track simultaneous actions.

My honest assessment:

I want to love this system for solo play, but it asks me to do significant adaptation work. The foundation is solid. The philosophy aligns with solo values. But the procedures assume a conversation partner I do not have, and the Alternative Play section does not bridge that gap.

An experienced solo player with an existing toolkit will find good bones here. A newcomer to solo RPGs looking for a complete package will struggle and may give up.

I will keep experimenting. The experimental part of my brain is already designing frameworks that could sit atop these rules. But that is work I am doing, not work the book did for me.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 26: Alternative Play

**Issue:** Solo play section provides surface-level acknowledgment without procedural depth. No oracle tables, no self-adjudication frameworks, no guidance on running adversaries against yourself.

**Impact:** Solo players must import external tools (Mythic, MUNE, etc.) or develop house rules for fundamental procedures. High barrier for newcomers to solo play.

**Location:** Chapter 26: Alternative Play - Solo and Duet Play subsection

### 2. Chapter 16-17: Proficiencies

**Issue:** Proficiency application requires GM interpretation. Solo players must adjudicate their own Proficiency claims, creating bias risk in either direction.

**Impact:** Without external validation, solo players may either always apply Proficiencies (gaming the system) or never apply them (excessive harshness). Collaborative negotiation model does not translate.

**Location:** Chapter 16: When Proficiencies Apply

### 3. Chapter 24: NPCs, VPCs, and Enemies

**Issue:** VPC tactical guidelines assume GM operation. No procedures for running adversaries against yourself fairly, including decision-making frameworks or behavior tables.

**Impact:** Solo players must develop their own adversary AI, a significant design burden that prevents immediate play.

**Location:** Chapter 24: Running VPCs in Play

### 4. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Check procedures assume external call (GM determines when to roll). Solo players need criteria for when to engage mechanical resolution versus pure narration.

**Impact:** Risk of over-rolling (killing momentum) or under-rolling (avoiding stakes). No calibration guidance for solo context.

**Location:** Chapter 8: When to Call for a Check

### 5. Chapter 9: Clocks

**Issue:** Clock advancement triggers assume GM agency (offscreen threats, soft moves). Solo players need explicit timing rules for passive Clock progression.

**Impact:** Ambiguity about when to tick Clocks not directly related to player actions. Requires house rules for scene-boundary or oracle-triggered advancement.

**Location:** Chapter 9: Advancing Clocks

### 6. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Skills and Proficiencies encourage custom creation through collaborative dialogue. No curated lists for solo players to select from.

**Impact:** Character creation takes significantly longer without a partner to bounce ideas against. Custom elements may be poorly calibrated without external feedback.

**Location:** Chapter 6: Step Four (Skills) and Step Five (Proficiencies)

### 7. Chapter 10: Conditions

**Issue:** Condition application often depends on fictional positioning that GM and player negotiate together. Solo players must both impose and experience Conditions.

**Impact:** Potential for either excessive Condition accumulation (harsh self-judgment) or insufficient consequences (favoring player character). No solo-specific guidance.

**Location:** Chapter 10: Gaining and Clearing Conditions


## Overall Assessment

As an experienced solo player with seven-plus years of adapting systems for table-of-one play, I find Razorweave to be a solid foundation that requires substantial modification for my use case.

Clarity & Readability (8/10): The book is well-organized and clearly written. Examples illuminate rules effectively. Reference during play is fast. The synthwave aesthetic does not compromise legibility.

Rules Accuracy (8/10): Internal consistency is strong. The 4d6 resolution, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks interlock cleanly. A few edge cases around stacking modifiers could use clarification, but core mechanics are sound.

Persona Fit (6/10): This is where my specific needs diverge from the book's design targets. Razorweave is built for collaborative play with a GM. Solo play is acknowledged but not supported. The fiction-first philosophy aligns with how I play, but the procedural assumptions do not. Every chapter assumes a conversation partner providing external judgment, fictional input, and mechanical calls.

Practical Usability (5/10): For solo play specifically, this score reflects the adaptation work required. I cannot pick up this book and play solo immediately. I need oracles (not provided), self-adjudication procedures (not provided), adversary behavior frameworks (not provided), and Clock advancement triggers for solo context (not provided). The tools that ARE provided are excellent; there just are not enough of them for my use case.

What I want the designers to know: You have built something with real potential for solo play. The 4d6 engine is fast and produces interesting outcomes. Clocks are exactly what solo play needs. Tags create fictional grounding with mechanical consequence. The genre-agnostic design lets me explore freely.

But solo players are a significant and growing market segment. We buy supplements. We evangelize systems that work for us. A dedicated solo play expansion could make Razorweave a go-to system for our community. Give us oracle tables calibrated to your setting. Give us adversary behavior procedures. Give us guidance on fair self-adjudication. Give us pre-built Skill and Proficiency lists for faster character creation without a partner.

I will continue experimenting with Razorweave. The experimental, exploratory part of my approach to gaming finds genuine pleasure in adapting systems. But I want to be honest in this review: the book as written does not meet solo players where we are. It asks us to do the work of bridging that gap ourselves.

For other solo players reading this: approach with realistic expectations and a willingness to hybrid the system with your existing solo toolkit. For the design team: there is an audience here waiting for you to serve us more directly.
