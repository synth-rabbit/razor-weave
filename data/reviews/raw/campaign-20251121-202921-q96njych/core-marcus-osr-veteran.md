## Narrative Feedback

After two decades of running old-school games where player skill and tactical choices determine survival, I approached the Razorweave Core Rulebook with considerable skepticism. Fiction-first systems have always struck me as trading away the concrete procedures that make games actually playable at the table. After a thorough read, my assessment is mixed.

The book is competently written, I will grant that. The structure moves logically from concepts to procedures to reference material. Chapter 8 on Actions, Checks, and Outcomes lays out the core resolution mechanism clearly enough: 4d6 plus Attribute plus Skill versus DC, with a margin determining outcome tiers. The DC ladder from 12 to 22 is sensible, and the Edge/Burden system provides a mathematically bounded way to represent circumstances without spiraling modifiers. These are solid bones.

However, my central concern is this: where are the concrete procedures for the GM? The book repeatedly tells me to "follow the fiction" and "let the story guide you," but what exactly should I be doing when a player declares they want to scale a cliff? The text says I should consider "uncertainty, consequence, and agency" before calling for a Check. Fine. But then what? How do I actually adjudicate whether they slip on the third handhold versus the seventh? The answer seems to be "make it up based on how interesting it would be," which is precisely the kind of vague guidance that makes me reach for my B/X rulebook instead.

The attribute spread of 2/1/1/0 at character creation produces very flat characters mathematically. A +2 versus +0 difference amounts to maybe a 7% swing in success rate on 4d6. In OSR games, a 3 versus 18 in a stat creates dramatic differentiation. Here, everyone is basically competent at everything, which undermines the tactical tension I value. If my fighter and my mage are only slightly different at physical tasks, why bother specializing?

Chapter 10 on Combat Basics is where I had hoped to find tactical meat. Instead, I find a system that explicitly removes hit points in favor of Resolve Clocks. The justification is that this keeps combat "aligned with the story." But story is what happens AFTER the rules determine outcomes, not a replacement for rules. The four combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) are reasonable abstractions, but without positioning rules, weapon differentiation, or resource management beyond Clocks, combat feels like collaborative description with dice occasionally rolled.

The Skills and Proficiencies system is frustratingly open-ended. The book encourages me to let players define custom Skills and says the GM has "final approval over scope." But how do I know if "Social Media Savvy" is too broad or "19th Century Telegraph Cipher Analysis" is too narrow? Where are the calibration examples that help me make consistent rulings? I have seen too many story games devolve into arguments about whether a player's self-defined ability covers a particular situation.

Tags and Conditions are genuinely useful. I appreciate having a shared vocabulary for environmental and status effects. The way Dim Light, Slick, and Cramped interact with Edge/Burden is well-conceived. If the whole system were this concrete, I would be more enthusiastic.

Clocks are clever, I admit. Using them to track both player progress and GM-side threats creates real tension. The Investigation versus Cover-Up Clock example in Chapter 9 shows how this can drive play forward. This is one area where the abstraction serves a clear procedural purpose.

The GM chapters (21-26) contain useful advice, but they read more like philosophy than procedure. I want to know: when an NPC attacks, exactly what happens? When the players split the party, how do I handle time? When a Clock fills, what are my options? The answers I find are variants of "do what makes sense for the fiction," which does not help me run a fair and consistent game.

What this book lacks is the killer GM procedure that OSR games excel at: the dungeon turn, the encounter check, the reaction roll, the morale system. These are not creative straitjackets; they are tools that let me run a world that feels objective and discoverable rather than arbitrary. Razorweave trusts me to improvise everything, which means my players are not exploring a world but experiencing my moment-to-moment creative decisions.

For tables that prioritize collaborative story creation over challenge-based play, this may work well. For my table, where player skill and tactical choices should determine outcomes within a simulated world, the fiction-first approach creates too much uncertainty about what the rules actually guarantee.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Attribute spread produces mathematically flat characters

**Impact:** The 2/1/1/0 spread creates only minor mechanical differentiation between characters. A +2 difference on 4d6 does not produce the dramatic specialization that rewards player tactical choices about party composition and role selection.

**Location:** Step Three: Assign Attributes

### 2. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** DC setting guidance is qualitative rather than procedural

**Impact:** GMs who want to run consistent, fair challenges lack concrete benchmarks. The DC ladder exists but mapping specific fictional situations to specific DCs requires GM fiat rather than reference to established procedures.

**Location:** Setting DCs subsection

### 3. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** No weapon differentiation, positioning rules, or resource management

**Impact:** Tactical players cannot make meaningful choices about equipment, positioning, or resource expenditure because these elements exist only in the fiction with no mechanical backing. Combat becomes descriptive rather than strategic.

**Location:** Core Combat Actions

### 4. Chapter 14: Skills System Overview

**Issue:** Custom Skill creation lacks calibration guidelines

**Impact:** Without clear scope examples showing what constitutes too-broad or too-narrow Skills, GMs will make inconsistent rulings that undermine player trust in the system's fairness.

**Location:** Creating Custom Skills

### 5. Chapter 21: Running Sessions

**Issue:** Missing procedural GM tools like encounter tables and reaction rolls

**Impact:** GMs who want to run objective, discoverable worlds lack the randomized procedures that remove GM bias from moment-to-moment decisions. The world feels authored rather than simulated.

**Location:** Throughout chapter

### 6. Chapter 7: Characters and Attributes

**Issue:** No guidance on attribute prerequisites or minimum requirements

**Impact:** Unlike traditional systems where certain capabilities require certain stats, here any character can attempt anything with only minor penalties. This removes meaningful trade-offs from character creation.

**Location:** Attribute Ratings and What They Mean


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a well-written fiction-first system that will satisfy tables prioritizing collaborative narrative over tactical challenge. For an OSR veteran like myself who values concrete procedures, objective world simulation, and meaningful mechanical differentiation, it falls short in several important ways.

The core resolution mechanic is mathematically sound. Tags and Clocks are genuinely useful tools. The book is organized logically and written clearly. However, the fiction-first philosophy permeates every system in ways that undermine procedural play.

My primary concerns are: (1) Characters are mathematically too similar to create meaningful specialization. (2) DCs and difficulty settings rely on GM interpretation rather than established benchmarks. (3) Combat lacks the tactical depth that rewards system mastery. (4) Custom Skills and Proficiencies invite scope creep without adequate calibration tools. (5) GM procedures are philosophical rather than concrete.

I recognize this book was not written for me. It was written for GMs who want flexibility and players who want collaborative story creation. For those tables, it may be excellent. But I cannot recommend it for groups that want the GM to simulate an objective world with consistent, discoverable rules.

If Razorweave produced a supplement with encounter procedures, treasure generation, dungeon-turn mechanics, and optional weapon/armor differentiation, I would reconsider. As written, this is a story game with tactical elements, not a tactical game with story elements.

Final Rating: 6/10 - Competent design for its intended audience, but fundamentally misaligned with OSR-style play.
