## Narrative Feedback

As someone who came to TTRPGs through narrative-focused indie games like Blades in the Dark and Apocalypse World, reading Razorweave feels like coming home. This is a game that genuinely understands what fiction-first play means in practice, not just as a marketing tagline.

The opening chapters immediately set the right tone: 'The story comes first. Mechanics support the story when the outcome of an action is uncertain and meaningful. When the outcome is clear, you simply describe what happens and move on.' That is exactly the philosophy I want from a game. The explicit framing of 'Intent and Approach' before any dice hit the table is beautifully implemented - it ensures players are always thinking narratively first.

What really excites me is the outcome ladder. Partial Success as a core story beat is chef's kiss. The game explicitly states that 'Failure is not an end point. It is a change in direction.' This creates the emergent storytelling I love, where complications and costs drive the narrative forward rather than binary pass/fail states.

The collaborative framing is excellent. 'The table is a creative team' appears throughout, and the game genuinely means it. The GM guidance boxes consistently emphasize honest world presentation and shared authority over narrative outcomes. The principles of play chapter reads like a love letter to collaborative storytelling.

The Clock system borrows elegantly from Blades in the Dark and integrates smoothly with the check system. Using opposing clocks for dramatic tension (like the Evacuation vs Flood example) is exactly the kind of tool that generates emergent stories.

Character creation emphasizes story-relevant choices over mechanical optimization. The fact that Skills and Proficiencies are open-ended and collaboratively defined with the GM means characters can be deeply personal rather than cookie-cutter builds. The explicit instruction to define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads gives me the narrative hooks I need to make characters who matter.

The four-attribute system (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) is elegant and the guidance on how Intent and Approach determine which attribute applies is excellent. The same goal can use different attributes based on how you describe your character attempting it - that is the kind of flexibility that supports creative problem-solving and character expression.

My only reservations are minor. The 4d6 resolution might feel slightly more mathematical than some ultra-light narrative games I prefer, and I would love to see more explicit player narrative authority mechanics (like Fate points or Keys from Lady Blackbird). But these are minor quibbles with what is otherwise a beautifully designed fiction-first system.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

**Issue:** Mathematical overhead in resolution

**Impact:** The 4d6 + modifier + margin calculation is more math than pure narrative games like Belonging Outside Belonging or even PbtA 2d6. During high-tension moments, this could slow the narrative flow slightly.

**Location:** Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

### 2. Player Agency Comes From Clear Choices

**Issue:** Limited explicit player narrative authority

**Impact:** While the game emphasizes collaborative storytelling, it lacks explicit meta-currency mechanics (like Fate points) that let players directly shape the fiction beyond their character actions. Some indie game players may miss this.

**Location:** Chapter 4 - Core Principles of Play

### 3. Character Creation - Goals and Drives

**Issue:** No mechanical integration of narrative threads

**Impact:** Personal Threads and Drives are defined but do not have explicit mechanical weight like Keys in Lady Blackbird or Aspects in Fate. This may make them feel less impactful to players used to those systems.

**Location:** Chapter 6 - Character Creation, Step Eight

### 4. GM Describes Outcomes, Not Numbers

**Issue:** GM-centric outcome interpretation

**Impact:** The outcome interpretation is primarily GM responsibility. More collaborative games allow players to narrate their own successes or failures. Some tables may want explicit permission to share this authority.

**Location:** Chapter 4 - Core Principles of Play


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a remarkably well-designed fiction-first roleplaying game that will feel immediately comfortable to anyone coming from the indie game space. It successfully integrates narrative-focused design principles with just enough mechanical structure to provide satisfying resolution without overshadowing the story.

The explicit emphasis on Intent and Approach, the elegant Partial Success outcomes, the collaborative GM philosophy, and the open-ended character elements make this exactly the kind of game I would recommend to my indie gaming friends. It bridges the gap between traditional resolution systems and pure narrative games beautifully.

For someone like me who evangelizes fiction-first play, this is a game I can enthusiastically recommend. It validates narrative priorities while providing enough crunch for players who want some mechanical teeth to their decisions. The Clock system and outcome tiers generate exactly the kind of emergent storytelling I love.

Score: 8.5/10 - A strong fiction-first system that understands what makes collaborative storytelling work. Minor improvements in player narrative authority and narrative thread integration would make it exceptional.
