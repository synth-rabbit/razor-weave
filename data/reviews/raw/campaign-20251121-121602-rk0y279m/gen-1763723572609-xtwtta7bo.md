## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been running games for years but mostly in a casual capacity, I found the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a mixed bag for my particular situation. The fiction-first approach is something I'm actively trying to embrace - I've been moving away from crunchier systems - so seeing it explained so thoroughly is genuinely helpful.

The writing itself is clear and the structure makes sense. I appreciate that they tell you upfront what each chapter covers and give you permission to learn in layers rather than memorizing everything at once. That's realistic for how casual groups actually approach a new system.

However, as someone who advocates for GMless play, I was disappointed by how little attention that mode gets compared to traditional GM-led play. Chapter 5 mentions GMless cooperative play as a supported mode, but the actual procedures for rotating authority and distributing scene framing feel underdeveloped. Where are the concrete tools? The book says the game "uses procedures that rotate authority" but doesn't explain what those procedures actually are in enough detail.

My concern about abstraction also reared its head. The system claims to be fiction-first, but then introduces concepts like "Clocks" and "Tags" that feel like game-y abstractions. I worry these tools might pull my players out of the narrative rather than supporting it. The book could do more to explain how these mechanical tools stay grounded in fiction.

As a genre-specific purist, I'm also uncertain how well this system would adapt to the specific genres I run. The examples are evocative (telegraph engineers, coastal towns, run-down depots) but they feel locked into a particular aesthetic. I'd need more guidance on how to strip the setting flavor and apply the core mechanics to different genres.

The verbal-focused explanations work well for me - I learn better from reading explanatory prose than from studying charts and diagrams. But ironically, some sections could use more concrete examples and less abstract explanation.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 5: Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** GMless play section lacks concrete procedures

**Impact:** Players interested in GMless games cannot actually run them with this book alone - they need external procedures or significant improvisation

**Location:** GMless Cooperative Play subsection

### 2. Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy not consistently demonstrated throughout

**Impact:** Casual players may struggle to understand when mechanics should and shouldn't intervene, leading to inconsistent table experiences

**Location:** Fiction First, Mechanics Second principle

### 3. Character Creation

**Issue:** Open lists for Skills and Proficiencies require significant GM guidance

**Impact:** Casual gaming groups without experienced GMs may create unbalanced or inappropriate entries, despite the book's assurances about stability

**Location:** Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies subsection

### 4. Ways to Play

**Issue:** Genre adaptation guidance is missing

**Impact:** Groups wanting to use this system for genres outside the implied setting will need to do significant work adapting tone and examples

**Location:** Hybrid Styles and Choosing the Right Mode subsections


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a thoughtful fiction-first system with clear writing and good pedagogical structure. For GMs converting from traditional systems to narrative play, it offers a solid bridge. However, casual gamers and GMless advocates will find gaps in practical support. The system excels at explaining principles but sometimes falls short on concrete procedures. I would recommend this to GMs who want to run fiction-first games with traditional authority structures, but with reservations for those seeking robust GMless play or easy genre portability. A solid 6.5 out of 10 for my particular use case - valuable as a learning resource, but requiring additional work to match my preferred play style.
