## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has been gaming for a couple of years and is starting to appreciate fiction-first systems, I find this rulebook has both exciting strengths and some frustrating gaps for my playstyle. I came into TTRPGs looking for that competitive edge - the thrill of building powerful characters and mastering tactical encounters. This system's fiction-first approach is growing on me, but I still want to feel like my character can dominate when the moment calls for it.

The book's writing is clear and well-organized. I appreciated the progressive chapter structure - being able to jump in after Chapter 6 and come back to details later suits how I learn. The verbal explanations work well for me; I can read the examples and understand the flow. However, some sections feel unnecessarily lengthy when I just want to know 'how do I win this encounter?'

What really works is the Collaborative Storyteller philosophy embedded throughout. I run games this way myself, and the GM sections provide solid guidance for building dramatic moments. The emphasis on failure creating momentum rather than stopping the story is something I've come to appreciate.

Where I struggle is the mechanical depth - or lack thereof for competitive play. As a Killer archetype, I want clear optimization paths. The four Attributes (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) are elegant, but the Skills and Proficiencies system feels vague about what makes a character 'better' at something. I'm converting from crunchier systems, and while I'm embracing narrative play, I still want satisfying mechanical progression that rewards system mastery.

The genre-agnostic design is a huge plus. I love being able to adapt this to different settings without learning entirely new systems. That flexibility appeals to my desire to explore different types of challenges and competitive scenarios.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6 - Character Creation

**Issue:** Lacks clear optimization guidance for players who want to build effective characters

**Impact:** Players with a competitive mindset may feel lost without explicit 'best practices' or power benchmarks

**Location:** Step Three: Assign Attributes and Steps Four/Five on Skills/Proficiencies

### 2. Chapter 2 - Core Concepts at a Glance

**Issue:** Outcome tiers described but not numerically defined in the overview

**Impact:** Early Intermediate players converting from traditional systems need concrete numbers sooner to build mental models

**Location:** Checks and Outcomes subsection

### 3. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Partial success mechanics could benefit from more concrete examples of 'success with cost' in tactical situations

**Impact:** Killer-archetype players need to understand how to maximize outcomes in competitive moments

**Location:** Referenced in table of contents, specific mechanics section

### 4. Part II - Skills and Proficiencies Reference

**Issue:** No comparative analysis of skill effectiveness or situational advantages

**Impact:** Makes it difficult to plan character builds for specific tactical niches

**Location:** Chapters 14-17


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a well-crafted fiction-first system that will serve collaborative storytelling tables well. For someone like me - a Killer archetype with early intermediate experience who is converting to narrative systems - it offers a thoughtful bridge between traditional and story-focused play. The clear writing and organized structure make it accessible, and the genre-agnostic design provides exciting flexibility.

However, the book underserves players who seek mechanical mastery and optimization. While I appreciate the narrative philosophy, the system could better acknowledge that some players find joy in building effective characters and 'winning' within the story's framework. A dedicated section on tactical play or character optimization would significantly improve the book's appeal to competitive players without undermining its fiction-first core.

Rating Summary: Clarity 7/10 (good organization, sometimes verbose), Rules Accuracy 8/10 (consistent internal logic), Persona Fit 6/10 (needs more for competitive players), Practical Usability 6/10 (good for story play, lacking for tactical reference at the table).
