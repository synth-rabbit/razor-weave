## Narrative Feedback

As someone who lives and breathes their characters, I found myself genuinely moved by how Razorweave approaches the craft of roleplaying. This isn't just another rulebook that treats characters as collections of numbers and abilities - it's a manifesto for those of us who believe that the soul of a character matters more than their stat block.

The "Fiction First" philosophy speaks directly to my heart. When I read "The story is always the starting point," I felt seen. Too many systems force you to think mechanically first, then retrofit the narrative. Razorweave flips this beautifully. The character creation chapter's emphasis on identity elements - mannerisms, first impressions, formative experiences - gives me the scaffolding I need to build a three-dimensional person, not just a game piece.

I was particularly struck by the Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads section. These aren't optional flavor text; they're woven into the fabric of how the game expects characters to exist in the world. Rella's "drive to avoid causing harm through her work" and her unresolved pattern mystery - these are exactly the kinds of internal tensions I crave when building a character. They give me emotional hooks to play.

The relationship mechanics also resonate deeply. The example of Rella and Isten's unresolved argument is perfect. That tension is character development waiting to happen. The book understands that characters aren't islands - they're defined by their connections and conflicts with others.

However, I wish the book dove deeper into emotional arc progression. While the Conditions system mentions ongoing states, I'd love more guidance on how characters can mechanically evolve their psychological landscape. How does trauma manifest? How does growth feel mechanically? The "Failure Creates Momentum" principle hints at this but doesn't fully deliver the emotional texture I'm seeking.

The collaborative storytelling emphasis ("The Table Is a Creative Team") creates space for the kind of character moments I live for. But as a non-GM player, I sometimes wonder if the heavy GM-centric sections diminish my agency in shaping my character's internal journey.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Character Creation - Identity Elements

**Issue:** Limited guidance on portraying internal emotional states

**Impact:** Method actors need more tools for expressing character psychology beyond external mannerisms

**Location:** Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements

### 2. Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads

**Issue:** Personal threads lack mechanical integration

**Impact:** Emotional storylines may feel disconnected from gameplay without clearer trigger mechanisms

**Location:** Step Eight

### 3. Conditions System

**Issue:** Conditions are framed mechanically rather than psychologically

**Impact:** Difficult to portray nuanced emotional states like grief, guilt, or conflicted loyalty

**Location:** Core Concepts - Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

### 4. Example Character Rella

**Issue:** Example focuses more on skills and background than inner life

**Impact:** New players may not understand how to develop rich internal character narratives

**Location:** Example Character Build: Rella

### 5. Ways to Play

**Issue:** Method acting approach not explicitly discussed as a playstyle

**Impact:** Deep character immersion players may feel their style isn't fully supported

**Location:** Chapter 5: Ways to Play the Game


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a breath of fresh air for those of us who approach roleplaying as an exercise in empathy and emotional truth. The fiction-first philosophy creates genuine space for character-driven play, and the emphasis on relationships, drives, and personal threads acknowledges that characters are more than their mechanical capabilities.

For method actors with my experience level, this book delivers strong foundations but leaves me wanting more depth in the psychological toolkit. I can work with what's here - the framework is sound and the philosophy is aligned with how I play. But I'll be building my own techniques for tracking emotional arcs, portraying internal conflict, and making psychological growth feel tangible at the table.

The 9/10 persona fit reflects how well the core philosophy matches my values, even as I note gaps in the execution. This is a system I could genuinely lose myself in - and that's the highest compliment a method actor can offer.
