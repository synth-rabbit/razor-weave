## Narrative Feedback

As someone who primarily plays solo or with minimal groups, I came to the Razorweave Core Rulebook looking for a system that could support my self-directed play style. After reading through the material, I have mixed but generally positive feelings.

The good news is that this book genuinely acknowledges solo play as a legitimate mode from the very beginning. Chapter 5 "Ways to Play" explicitly lists solo play alongside group play, and Chapter 26 "Alternative Play" dedicates substantial space to solo play with VPC companions, oracles, and journaling techniques. That alone sets this apart from many systems that treat solo play as an afterthought.

The fiction-first approach resonates deeply with my experimental style. I appreciate that the rules only engage when outcomes are "uncertain and meaningful" - this gives me freedom to narrate stretches of my solo journeys without constantly reaching for dice. The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks system is elegant and works beautifully for tracking progress without a GM present.

The VPC (Virtual Player Character) system in Chapter 24 is particularly well-designed for solo players. Having mechanical support for companions that fill skill gaps while keeping decision-making in the player's hands is exactly what solo play needs. The guidance on keeping VPCs as "mirrors and sounding boards" rather than story drivers shows real understanding of solo play dynamics.

However, I do have concerns. While the solo play support exists, it feels somewhat scattered across multiple chapters rather than consolidated. I found myself flipping between Chapters 5, 24, 26, and various sheets in Chapter 27 to piece together a complete solo play framework. A dedicated "Solo Play Quick Start" section would help tremendously.

The oracle system mentioned in Chapter 26 is frustratingly brief. It mentions "Yes/No/Complication" prompts but doesn't provide actual oracle tables. For a 500KB rulebook, I expected more comprehensive solo tools - random tables for NPC generation, scene complications, environment details, and faction moves would make this book genuinely self-contained for solo play.

The GMless procedures (rotating facilitator, shared authority) are useful for when I occasionally play with one or two others, but the documentation assumes at least some degree of group coordination. True solo guidance for world-building authority remains somewhat underdeveloped.

That said, the Clocks and Fronts system is magnificent for solo play. Being able to track multiple advancing threats that move "regardless of player action" creates genuine tension and surprise even when I'm playing alone. The example in Chapter 26 with the "Security Systems Wake" Clock demonstrates exactly how this can work.

The character sheets and play aids in Chapter 27 are comprehensive, and I appreciate the Session Log template - essential for maintaining continuity across solo sessions. The journaling guidance, though brief, acknowledges the importance of record-keeping for solo play.

Overall, this is a solid foundation for solo play that respects my playstyle, but it requires more work on my part to fill in the gaps. I'll likely supplement with third-party oracle tools and random tables. The core mechanical framework is sound - I just wish the book was more self-contained for solo use.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 26 - Alternative Play

**Issue:** Oracle and prompt system is mentioned but not provided in detail

**Impact:** Solo players must source external oracle tables or create their own, reducing the book's self-containment

**Location:** Section "Using Oracles and Prompts" (lines 7679-7699)

### 2. Chapter 5 - Ways to Play

**Issue:** Solo play overview is brief and primarily points to other chapters

**Impact:** Requires significant cross-referencing to understand the full solo play framework

**Location:** Section "Solo Play" (lines 1752-1757)

### 3. Chapter 27 - Sheets and Play Aids

**Issue:** No dedicated solo play tracking sheet or oracle reference card

**Impact:** Solo players lack a consolidated quick-reference for their specific needs

**Location:** Throughout chapter - sheets are primarily GM and group-focused

### 4. Chapter 26 - Alternative Play

**Issue:** GMless procedures assume multiple players for turn-based scene framing

**Impact:** True solo play (single player, no GM) requires adaptation of these procedures

**Location:** Section "GMless Procedures" (lines 7639-7656)

### 5. Chapter 24 - NPCs, VPCs, and Enemies

**Issue:** VPC creation guidance doesn't include quick-generation tables for solo play

**Impact:** Creating VPC companions on the fly during solo sessions is more time-consuming than necessary

**Location:** Section "Designing Strong VPCs" (lines 7371-7389)

## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook demonstrates genuine commitment to supporting solo play, which is refreshing in the TTRPG landscape. The fiction-first philosophy, Tags/Conditions/Clocks system, and VPC framework provide excellent mechanical foundations for solo adventures. The book explicitly acknowledges solo play as a valid mode from Chapter 5 onward and dedicates meaningful space to alternative play modes.

However, from a solo player's perspective, the book falls short of being truly self-contained. The absence of comprehensive oracle tables, random generators, and consolidated solo play tools means I'll need to supplement with external resources. The guidance is scattered across multiple chapters rather than consolidated, and the GMless procedures don't fully address true single-player scenarios.

For experienced solo players comfortable with improvisation and external tools, this book provides an excellent framework. For solo players seeking a complete, out-of-the-box solo experience, additional supplements or personal oracle development will be necessary. The foundation is strong, but the solo-specific tooling needs expansion.

Rating: 7/10 for solo play readiness - good philosophical foundation and mechanical support, but incomplete practical tooling.
