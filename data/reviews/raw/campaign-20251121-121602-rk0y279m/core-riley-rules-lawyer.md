## Narrative Feedback

Let me be direct: this rulebook has potential, but it also has issues that need addressing before it reaches the table.

First, the good. The core resolution mechanic (4d6, keep 4, margin-based outcomes) is mathematically sound and produces a reasonable probability curve. The five-tier outcome system (Critical Success at +5, Full Success at 0+, Partial Success at -1 to -2, Failure at -3 to -6, Critical Failure at -7 or below/all 1s) gives GMs and players clear guidelines. The Edge/Burden system (roll extra dice, keep best/worst 4, capped at +/-2) is elegant and avoids modifier stacking problems.

However, I found several inconsistencies that are unacceptable in a game that expects precise adjudication:

1. **DC Ladder Contradiction**: Chapter 8 defines the DC ladder as DC 12 (Easy), DC 14 (Routine), DC 16 (Tough), DC 18 (Hard), DC 20 (Heroic), DC 22 (Legendary). But the Quick Reference in Chapter 29 lists DC 12 as "Routine," DC 14 as "Challenging," DC 16 as "Difficult," DC 18 as "Formidable." These are completely different terminology sets. Which is correct? This will cause arguments at the table.

2. **Undefined Skill Bonus**: The check procedure says to "add the relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects," but I cannot find a single place in the book that specifies what numerical bonus Skills actually provide. Skills are described qualitatively but never quantified. Do they add +1? +2? This is a fundamental gap.

3. **Clock Segment Advancement**: The text says "Successful Checks tick the Clock forward" but never specifies how many segments. Later examples mention "Full Success ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment" but this is presented inconsistently. Is this the standard rule or just an example?

4. **Resolve Clock Sizing**: The text says GMs can "size clocks to match the scene: 2-3 segments for quick threats, more for major foes" but provides no guidance on what constitutes appropriate sizing. This is too vague for consistent rulings.

The fiction-first philosophy is fine for narrative games, but this book tries to have it both ways - providing concrete mechanical frameworks while leaving crucial details undefined. Either commit to a rules-light approach or fill in the gaps.

The Edge/Burden combination rules are clear and well-defined - that's a model the rest of the book should follow.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Setting DCs vs Chapter 29: Quick Reference

**Issue:** DC ladder terminology is inconsistent between chapters

**Impact:** GMs and players will disagree on difficulty naming, causing confusion. Example: DC 14 is 'Routine' in Chapter 8 but 'Challenging' in the index reference table.

**Location:** Chapter 8, lines ~2585-2590 vs Chapter 29, lines ~8807-8836

### 2. Chapter 8: Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

**Issue:** Skill bonuses are mentioned but never defined numerically

**Impact:** Players cannot calculate check totals correctly without knowing what bonus their Skills provide. The procedure says 'add bonuses from Skills' but no number is ever given.

**Location:** Chapter 8, line ~2630

### 3. Chapter 9: Advancing Clocks

**Issue:** Standard segment advancement rate is undefined

**Impact:** Different GMs will interpret clock advancement differently. Examples show 1-2 segments but this is never established as a rule.

**Location:** Chapter 9, lines ~2900-2913

### 4. Chapter 10: Resolve Instead of Hit Points

**Issue:** No guidance on appropriate Resolve Clock sizes by enemy tier

**Impact:** GMs must guess how many segments to assign enemies, leading to inconsistent difficulty across tables.

**Location:** Chapter 10, lines ~3007-3008

### 5. Chapter 6: Character Creation - Skills

**Issue:** Open skill list with no mechanical definition

**Impact:** The system says players choose skills but never explains what mechanical effect skills have. This creates uncertainty during character creation.

**Location:** Chapter 6, lines ~1966-1994


## Overall Assessment

From a rules lawyer's perspective, this rulebook is a mixed bag. The core dice mechanics (4d6 with Edge/Burden) are sound and well-designed. The outcome tier system provides clear decision points. However, the execution is undermined by terminology inconsistencies and undefined mechanical elements.

The DC ladder contradiction is the most egregious issue - two different naming schemes in the same book is simply an editing failure. The undefined Skill bonus is a fundamental design gap that needs immediate resolution.

I could run this game, but I would need to establish house rules for at least three undefined areas before the first session. For a system that emphasizes "fiction first," the ambiguity might be intentional, but then why include detailed reference tables at all?

Recommendation: The book needs a technical editing pass to standardize DC terminology and explicitly define Skill bonuses. Until then, expect rules questions at the table.

Rating Summary:
- Clarity: 7/10 - Generally readable, but inconsistencies hurt comprehension
- Rules Accuracy: 5/10 - Multiple contradictions and undefined mechanics
- Persona Fit: 6/10 - The mechanical framework is present but incomplete
- Practical Usability: 6/10 - Usable with house rules, not out of the box
