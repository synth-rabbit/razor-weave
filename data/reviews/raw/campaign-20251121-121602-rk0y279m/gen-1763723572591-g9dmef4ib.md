## Narrative Feedback

Look, I came into this rulebook wanting to know one thing: how do I win fights and overcome challenges? And honestly, I had to dig pretty hard to find what I was looking for.

The book spends a lot of time on "fiction first" philosophy and collaborative storytelling principles. That is fine for some folks, but as someone who likes clear victory conditions and tactical options, I found myself skimming through pages of advice about "narrative authority" and "scene direction" before getting to the actual mechanics.

When I finally got to the dice system (4d6, keep best/worst 4 with Edge/Burden), it is elegant enough. I appreciate that it is not overly complicated. The DC ladder from 12 to 22 is straightforward and easy to memorize. But here is my problem: where is the combat chapter? I kept looking for a dedicated section on conflict resolution, tactical options, damage, and defeat conditions. Instead, combat seems folded into the general "Actions, Checks, and Outcomes" framework without giving it special treatment.

For someone converting from more traditional systems with explicit combat rules, initiative orders, and hit points, this feels like I am missing something. The Skills section mentions "Melee Combat," "Firearms," and "Tactics" as conflict skills, but I wanted worked examples of actual fight scenes, not just the general check procedure applied to violence.

The character creation chapter is solid. I can build a combat-focused character with the right Attributes (probably MIG and AGI heavy) and conflict Skills. But the book does not really tell me what happens when I land a hit beyond "the fiction changes." I want to know: does the enemy go down? How many hits can they take? How do I actually defeat them?

On the positive side, the Edge/Burden system is something I can work with tactically. Setting up advantages before a fight, using environmental Tags, and stacking bonuses makes sense. That is the kind of strategic play I enjoy. The Conditions system also seems like it could create interesting "debuff" opportunities.

The reference sheets at the back are helpful, and I appreciate having the DC ladder and outcome tiers in a printable format. That is practical.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Combat Rules Section

**Issue:** No dedicated combat or conflict chapter with tactical depth

**Impact:** Players focused on tactical gameplay lack clear guidance on running fights, determining damage, and resolving defeat conditions

**Location:** Missing - combat mechanics scattered across Chapters 8, 14, and Skills references

### 2. Character Creation - Combat Focus

**Issue:** Character creation does not explicitly guide combat-focused builds

**Impact:** New players wanting to build effective combatants must infer optimal choices without direct guidance

**Location:** Chapter 6 - Character Creation, Steps 3-5 (Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies)

### 3. Outcome Interpretation

**Issue:** Outcome tiers (critical success to critical failure) described abstractly without concrete combat examples

**Impact:** Difficult to adjudicate what "partial success" means when attacking an enemy - reduced damage? Counter-attack? Unclear

**Location:** Chapter 8 - Interpreting Outcomes section

### 4. Victory Conditions

**Issue:** No clear guidance on when enemies are defeated or what constitutes "winning" a conflict

**Impact:** Creates uncertainty for players who want clear objectives and victory states in conflicts

**Location:** General - no specific section addresses this

### 5. Complexity vs Simplicity

**Issue:** Despite being a unified system, the book is quite long with many chapters on philosophy and principles

**Impact:** For simplicity seekers, the volume of material before reaching practical play guidance is daunting

**Location:** Part I Foundations - 5 chapters before Character Creation

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is clearly designed for collaborative storytellers who enjoy narrative flexibility over tactical precision. As a Killer archetype with 1-3 years of experience who seeks simpler systems, this book presents challenges. The core mechanics (4d6, Edge/Burden, DC ladder) are genuinely simple and elegant, which I appreciate. However, the fiction-first philosophy means combat does not get the dedicated treatment I would expect from my previous gaming experience.

The book would benefit from a dedicated conflict chapter with worked examples of fights, clear defeat conditions, and guidance on tactical options during combat scenes. As it stands, I would need significant table discussion with my GM to establish how we handle the specific situations I care about most.

For players like me who are "converting" from more traditional systems, I recommend reading Chapter 8 (Actions, Checks, Outcomes) and the conflict Skills entries first, then working backward through the principles. The philosophy sections are well-written but can wait until you have the mechanical foundation.

Rating: 6/10 overall - functional system with solid core mechanics, but misses the mark for tactical/combat-focused players.
