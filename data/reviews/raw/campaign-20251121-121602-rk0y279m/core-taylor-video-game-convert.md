## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so I just finished reading through this Razorweave Core Rulebook, and I have... thoughts. Coming from video games where I'm used to clear XP bars, level-up screens, and stat sheets that tell me exactly what +1 Strength does, this is a different experience.

The good news first: I actually really like the dice system. Rolling 4d6 and adding modifiers? That's familiar territory. The Edge/Burden system where you roll extra dice and keep best or worst 4? That's genius - it feels like the advantage/disadvantage systems I've seen in other games, but more nuanced. The DC ladder from 12 (Easy) to 22 (Legendary) is clear and gives me something concrete to work with.

But here's where it gets frustrating for me: the progression system. In a video game, I can see my XP bar filling up. I know exactly when I'll level up and what options I'll have. Here? It's "session-based" or "milestone" advancement, which basically means "whenever the GM feels like it." The Advancement Menu (Chapter 19) has options like "Attribute Growth: Raise one Attribute by +1" - but then it says Attributes only go up "a few times in an entire campaign." How many is a few? Three? Five? And what's the "agreed cap"? The book doesn't give me numbers!

The character creation process is... narrative. I get it, fiction-first and all that. But when the book says I choose Skills and Proficiencies without a fixed list, and I should "work with my GM" to define them? In a video game, I'd have a skill tree. I'd know what each skill does. Here, the scope of a Skill is basically "whatever you and the GM agree on." That flexibility might be great for experienced players, but for me, it just feels like I don't know what I'm building toward.

The whole "fiction-first, mechanics second" philosophy is repeated constantly. I understand the design intent - they want the story to drive everything. But as someone who likes clear systems and measurable progress, it sometimes feels like the rules are deliberately vague. When do I roll? "When the GM calls for a Check." What determines if something is a Skill or just a description? "Talk to your GM." How powerful will my character get? "Depends on the campaign."

I do appreciate the detailed outcome tiers though. Critical Success, Full Success, Partial Success, Failure, Critical Failure - these are clearly defined with specific margin thresholds. That's the kind of concrete information I can work with. The Clocks system is also cool - it's like progress bars but for narrative events. I can visualize that.

Overall, I think I could enjoy this game, but I'd need a GM who's patient with my questions and willing to give me more concrete benchmarks than the book does. The system underneath seems solid, but the presentation assumes you're already comfortable with ambiguity in TTRPGs.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long Term Growth

**Issue:** No concrete XP system or clear progression benchmarks

**Impact:** Players expecting video-game-style progression cannot predict when they will advance or plan builds effectively

**Location:** Advancement Triggers section - describes three vague trigger methods without specific numbers

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Open-ended Skill and Proficiency selection without a comprehensive list

**Impact:** New players cannot compare options or understand relative power levels; relies heavily on GM adjudication

**Location:** Step Four and Step Five - 'work with your GM to define custom entries'

### 3. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long Term Growth

**Issue:** Attribute caps described as 'agreed upon' without defaults

**Impact:** Cannot plan character build trajectory; no clear sense of power ceiling

**Location:** Attribute Advancement section - mentions 'table's agreed cap' without providing standard values

### 4. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** When to roll is entirely GM discretion

**Impact:** Inconsistent gameplay experience; cannot predict when skills will be tested

**Location:** When to Roll section - success depends on three subjective conditions evaluated by GM

### 5. Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy may conflict with systems-focused play style

**Impact:** Players who want clear mechanical frameworks may feel unmoored without concrete rules triggers

**Location:** Throughout chapter - repeated emphasis that mechanics follow fiction rather than driving it


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a well-designed fiction-first TTRPG that would work great for players comfortable with narrative flexibility - but as a video game convert, I found myself constantly wishing for more concrete numbers and clearer progression systems.

Strengths for my playstyle: The 4d6 resolution system with Edge/Burden is elegant and quantifiable. The DC ladder provides clear difficulty benchmarks. Outcome tiers have specific margin thresholds. The Clocks system provides visual progress tracking.

Challenges for my playstyle: Advancement is milestone/session-based rather than XP-driven. Skills and Proficiencies have no fixed list or power comparisons. Attribute caps are table-negotiated rather than standardized. The "when to roll" determination is entirely narrative/GM-driven.

The book is clearly written and well-organized, but its core philosophy assumes players are comfortable with collaborative world-building and loose mechanical frameworks. For someone like me who appreciates the clarity of video game RPG systems, this requires a significant mindset shift. I'd rate it accessible for experienced TTRPG players, but challenging for video game converts expecting concrete progression metrics.
