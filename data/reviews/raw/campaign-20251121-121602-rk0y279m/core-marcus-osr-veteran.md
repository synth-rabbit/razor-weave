## Narrative Feedback

Been running games since the early days of AD&D, and I have seen a lot of systems come and go. Razorweave has some solid bones, but it sits in an uncomfortable middle ground for an old-school gamer like myself.

The 4d6 resolution system is clean enough. Roll dice, add your Attribute, compare to a DC ladder. I appreciate that the DCs are laid out explicitly (DC 12 Routine up to DC 22 Nearly Impossible). That is the kind of concrete information I can work with. The five-tier outcome system (critical success, full success, partial success, failure, critical failure) adds nuance without drowning me in sub-tables.

What concerns me is the heavy emphasis on "fiction first" philosophy. The book repeats this mantra constantly, which feels like the designers do not trust GMs to make rulings. In my experience, a good GM does not need to be told that "the story comes first" every third paragraph. We know. Give me the tools and get out of the way.

The Attributes are streamlined to four (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN), which is refreshingly simple compared to the six-stat bloat of many modern games. The starting array (2, 1, 1, 0) creates meaningful differentiation without the illusion of infinite customization. That said, the range is narrow. An Attribute only ranging from 0 to perhaps 3 or 4 means the fiction and GM fiat carry enormous weight. That is fine if you trust your GM, but the book does not give enough guidance on where those boundaries lie.

The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks system is borrowed heavily from Blades in the Dark and Apocalypse World. If you know those games, you will recognize the DNA. Clocks are useful for tracking faction pressure and environmental threats. Tags as situational modifiers make sense. But the book could be tighter about when Tags grant Edge versus when they shift DCs. I found myself wondering whether these stack, and the text was not always clear.

Combat is conspicuously under-detailed. For a veteran who appreciates tactical depth and lethal consequences, the combat chapter feels thin. The book seems to assume that fighting is just another scene resolved through the same Check structure. That works for a narrative game, but it leaves tactical players like me wanting more crunch. Where are the hit points? The armor class equivalents? The wound tracks? The answer seems to be "Conditions," but those feel squishy and GM-dependent.

The GM section is extensive and provides good advice for session pacing, scenario design, and campaign management. The concept of "fronts" as organized threats with their own Clocks is well-executed. But I wanted more bestiary content, more trap examples, more dungeon design guidance. The book is clearly aimed at narrative drama rather than procedural exploration.

One strength: the book does encourage GM honesty and clear stakes. Players should know what they are risking. That aligns with old-school sensibilities. But the emphasis on "failure creates momentum" rather than "failure has consequences" softens the edge. In my games, a failed roll can mean death, not just a complication that pushes the story forward.

Overall, Razorweave is a competent modern narrative system that will appeal to fiction-first groups. For old-school tacticians who want rulings over rules but also want those rulings grounded in concrete mechanics, the book tries to serve both masters and does not fully satisfy either.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Resolution

**Issue:** Edge and Burden stacking rules unclear

**Impact:** GMs must improvise how multiple Tags interact, leading to inconsistent rulings across tables

**Location:** Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

### 2. Combat

**Issue:** Lack of concrete harm and injury mechanics

**Impact:** Combat lacks the tactical weight and lethality that old-school players expect; Conditions feel too abstract for tracking serious injury

**Location:** Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

### 3. Character Attributes

**Issue:** Narrow Attribute range (0-2 at creation) places excessive weight on GM interpretation

**Impact:** Character differentiation depends heavily on fiction rather than mechanical distinction

**Location:** Chapter 7 - Attributes

### 4. Fiction First Philosophy

**Issue:** Repetitive emphasis on fiction-first principles throughout text

**Impact:** Experienced GMs may find the constant reminders condescending; could be consolidated into one chapter

**Location:** Chapters 1-5 (multiple instances)

### 5. GM Tools

**Issue:** Missing concrete bestiary and procedural dungeon content

**Impact:** GMs running exploration-heavy or creature-focused games must create everything from scratch

**Location:** Part III - Game Master Section


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a streamlined narrative-first RPG system with a clean 4d6 + Attribute resolution engine and robust campaign management tools. For GMs who prioritize story over simulation, it offers a flexible framework with strong session and campaign guidance.

However, the system falls short for veteran players seeking tactical depth and lethal gameplay. Combat mechanics are abstract, relying on Conditions rather than concrete wound tracks. The fiction-first philosophy, while sound, is over-emphasized to the point of redundancy. The narrow Attribute range and heavy reliance on Tags means GM rulings carry tremendous weight without sufficient procedural guidance.

From an OSR perspective, this is a "rulings over rules" game that provides fewer rules than I would like to make those rulings against. Recommended for narrative-focused groups; less suitable for tactical grognards who want their dungeons dangerous and their combat decisive.
