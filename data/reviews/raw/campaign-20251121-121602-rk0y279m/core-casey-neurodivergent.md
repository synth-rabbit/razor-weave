## Narrative Feedback

As someone who values clear structure and explicit procedures, I found this rulebook to be a mixed experience. Let me break down what works and what creates friction for my pattern-driven mind.

**What Works Well:**
The core resolution system is beautifully consistent. The 4d6 + Attribute against DC structure appears everywhere, and I can rely on that pattern. The outcome tiers (Critical Success >= +5, Full Success >= 0, Partial Success -1 to -2, Failure <= -3, Critical Failure <= -7) are explicit and predictable. I appreciate that Edge and Burden have clear mechanical effects: +1 Edge means roll 5d6 keep best 4, -1 Burden means roll 5d6 keep worst 4. This is the kind of explicit procedure I can anchor to.

The DC ladder (12 Easy, 14 Routine, 16 Tough, 18 Hard, 20 Heroic, 22 Legendary) gives me concrete reference points. I can mentally map situations to difficulty levels.

**Where I Struggle:**
The "fiction first" approach creates significant ambiguity for me. The book repeatedly states that the GM decides when to roll, what Attribute applies, and what the consequences are based on narrative interpretation. As a player who prefers explicit procedures, this feels like too much is left to GM discretion. I cannot reliably predict when I will need to roll, which Attribute my action will use, or what the stakes are until the GM tells me.

The Skills and Proficiencies system is explicitly open-ended - players and GMs create custom entries together. While I understand the flexibility this offers, it means there is no authoritative list I can study and memorize. I cannot prepare by learning "all the skills" because the list is intentionally incomplete.

The combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) are well-defined, but the transition between "free conversation" and "structured turns" is ambiguous. The book says the table can ask "Is this structured combat now?" - but I would prefer a clearer trigger condition.

**Pattern Recognition Notes:**
I noticed several helpful patterns:
- Intent + Approach always precedes GM decisions about rolls
- Tags affect environment, Conditions affect characters (consistent distinction)
- Clocks segment sizes correlate to complexity (4 for quick, 6 for medium, 8 for long)
- Every outcome tier (including failure) must move the story forward

But I also noticed missing patterns:
- No explicit timing for when Tags or Conditions clear
- No formula for how many Skills/Proficiencies characters should have
- No procedure for resolving when multiple characters want to act simultaneously in non-combat

**Overall:**
The rulebook is well-organized with a clear chapter progression. The glossary and index are helpful for quick lookups. But the core philosophy of "rules as tools, not authority" conflicts with my need for explicit, predictable procedures. I can play this game, but I will need extra communication with my GM to establish clearer house rules about when mechanics trigger.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** When to roll criteria leaves significant GM discretion

**Impact:** I cannot predict when a roll will be required, making it hard to plan my actions confidently

**Location:** Section 'When to Roll (and When Not To)' - The three conditions (uncertainty, consequence, agency) are qualitative, not quantitative

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation - Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Open-ended Skill and Proficiency lists with no definitive scope

**Impact:** Cannot prepare by studying a complete list; must negotiate each entry with GM

**Location:** Section 'Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies' explicitly states lists are starting points, not comprehensive

### 3. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Ambiguous transition between free narration and structured combat

**Impact:** Unclear when 'combat mode' activates; relies on table consensus rather than explicit trigger

**Location:** Section 'Combat as a Scene' says table can ask 'Is this structured combat now?' without defining when to ask

### 4. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Condition clearing conditions are described narratively, not procedurally

**Impact:** I cannot reliably predict when my Conditions will clear without GM interpretation

**Location:** Section 'Introducing and Clearing Conditions' - clearing depends on 'time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock'

### 5. Chapter 7: Characters and Attributes

**Issue:** Attribute selection for checks determined by GM interpretation of approach

**Impact:** The same action could use different Attributes depending on how GM interprets my description

**Location:** Section 'Attributes, Intent, and Approach' - four different Attributes could apply to opening the same door

### 6. General Structure

**Issue:** No quick reference card or procedure summary

**Impact:** Must flip through chapters to reconstruct the full resolution procedure during play

**Location:** Missing from Part IV Reference Sheets section - would benefit from a single-page Check flowchart


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a thoughtfully designed fiction-first RPG system with a consistent mechanical core. The 4d6 resolution system, DC ladder, and outcome tiers provide solid anchors that I can rely on. The organization is logical, examples are plentiful, and the glossary helps with terminology.

However, this game is built on a philosophy that explicitly prioritizes narrative interpretation over procedural certainty. As a pattern-driven player who values explicit rules, I find the "GM decides based on fiction" approach creates cognitive overhead. I spend mental energy trying to predict how situations will be adjudicated rather than confidently executing established procedures.

For my play style, I would need:
1. A GM who establishes consistent house rules about when rolls trigger
2. Pre-agreed lists of which Skills and Proficiencies are available in our campaign
3. A reference sheet mapping common actions to Attributes
4. Clear session-zero discussion about how Tags and Conditions will be applied

The system can work for neurodivergent players with appropriate table support, but the core design philosophy assumes comfort with ambiguity that I do not share. Rating: Playable with accommodations, but not optimized for explicit-procedure preferences.
