## Narrative Feedback

As a busy parent with maybe an hour or two per week to prep for game night, I have mixed feelings about the Razorweave Core Rulebook.

**What works for me:**
The Quick Reference section in Chapter 29 is a lifesaver. Having the DC Ladder, Outcome Tiers, and Edge/Burden rules all in one place means I can glance at it mid-game without flipping through 30 chapters. The tables are clean and scannable - exactly what I need when the kids are asking questions and I need an answer NOW.

The "fiction first" philosophy actually helps my limited prep time. I don't need to memorize everything because I can just narrate what makes sense and only reach for rules when things get uncertain. That's a relief.

**Where I struggle:**
This book is LONG. Really long. As someone who can't sit down for hours to read rulebooks cover to cover, the 30-chapter structure feels overwhelming. I wish there was a "busy person's guide" - like a 5-page summary of just the essential rules I need to run a basic session.

Character creation (Chapter 6) has nine steps. Nine! I barely have time to make dinner some nights, let alone walk four players through nine steps each. The worked example character (Rella) helps, but I'd love pre-generated characters or a "quick start" character option.

The combat system using Clocks and Conditions instead of hit points is clever, but it took me a few re-reads to understand how Resolve Clocks work. A visual diagram showing a combat round from start to finish would have helped tremendously.

**My recommendation for other busy parents:**
Read Chapters 1-5 to get the vibe, then jump straight to Chapter 29's Quick Reference. Keep that page bookmarked. Learn the rest as you go - the system is forgiving enough that you can muddle through early sessions and pick up the details over time. Just don't expect to master this in one sitting.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Nine-step character creation process is too lengthy for time-constrained sessions

**Impact:** New players and busy GMs may struggle to complete character creation in a reasonable timeframe, potentially discouraging first sessions

**Location:** The Creation Flow section listing Steps One through Nine

### 2. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock system lacks visual aid for quick comprehension

**Impact:** Parents running their first combat may stumble trying to track Clocks mentally without a clear visual reference, slowing down play

**Location:** Resolve Instead of Hit Points subsection

### 3. Table of Contents / Navigation

**Issue:** No quick-start summary or condensed rules reference in the front matter

**Impact:** Busy readers must navigate 30 chapters to find essential rules rather than having a one-page 'get started in 5 minutes' guide upfront

**Location:** Part I: Foundations introduction

### 4. Chapter 29: Comprehensive Index

**Issue:** Quick Reference section is excellent but buried at the end of the book

**Impact:** New readers may not discover the most useful reference material until they've already struggled through earlier chapters

**Location:** Quick Reference section placement

### 5. Overall Book Structure

**Issue:** No pre-generated characters or quick-start character templates provided

**Impact:** Groups with limited time cannot jump straight into play without significant prep investment

**Location:** Throughout Part I and Part II


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a well-designed, thoughtfully written game system that unfortunately asks for more of my time than I can give. For parents and casual gamers who can only squeeze in occasional sessions, this book requires a strategic approach: use the Quick Reference religiously, lean on the fiction-first philosophy to wing it when rules are unclear, and accept that you'll learn by playing rather than by reading.

The core mechanics are sound and the book is internally consistent - when I do find a rule, it works as expected and connects logically to other rules. The problem isn't quality; it's accessibility for time-limited players.

I'd rate this book as "good with caveats" for my situation. If the publishers added a 5-page quick-start guide, some pre-gen characters, and moved the Quick Reference to the front of the book, this would jump from a 6 to an 8 for busy parent accessibility. As it stands, I'll make it work, but I'll also be doing a lot of improv while my bookmark slowly migrates through the chapters over the coming months.
