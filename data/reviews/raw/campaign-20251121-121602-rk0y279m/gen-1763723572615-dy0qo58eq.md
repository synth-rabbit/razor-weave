## Narrative Feedback

As a veteran player who has spent over a decade optimizing builds and analyzing game mechanics, I find Razorweave's Core Rulebook to be a thoughtfully designed system that prioritizes narrative flow over mechanical crunch. The 4d6 resolution mechanic with Edge/Burden modifiers is elegantly simple yet provides meaningful tactical choices.

The fiction-first approach is clearly articulated throughout, and I appreciate how the book consistently demonstrates intent and approach as the foundation for mechanical resolution. The DC scale (Easy 10, Routine 14, Tough 16, Hard 18, Extreme 20) provides clear benchmarks for setting difficulty.

However, as someone who enjoys planning tactical approaches, I found myself wanting more concrete mechanical options to differentiate characters beyond the Attribute/Skill/Proficiency framework. The open-ended Skill and Proficiency lists are flexible but may feel underdefined for tactically-minded players who prefer comparing discrete options.

The chapter organization follows a logical flow from principles to character creation to resolution mechanics. The examples are consistent and illustrative. The visual design with synthwave colors and torn-paper callout boxes makes the document visually distinct, though the dense CSS styling in the HTML suggests this is optimized for web/PDF rather than quick table reference.

My Scene Framer GM philosophy aligns well with the system's emphasis on scene direction and clear stakes. The Clocks and Tags systems provide good pacing tools. The fiction-first resolution keeps gameplay moving without getting bogged down in modifiers.

As someone converting to fiction-first play, I see the value in this approach but occasionally miss having more mechanical levers to pull during tactical encounters.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Edge/Burden system lacks detailed examples of stacking rules

**Impact:** Tactically-minded players may be uncertain how multiple sources of Edge/Burden interact, leading to table variance

**Location:** The section describes +1/+2 Edge and -1/-2 Burden but doesn't clarify maximum stacking limits or cancellation rules

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation - Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Open-ended Skill/Proficiency lists may feel underdefined

**Impact:** Players who prefer comparing concrete options during character building may struggle with the collaborative definition approach

**Location:** Step Four and Step Five describe choosing Skills/Proficiencies but provide limited example lists

### 3. Overall Structure

**Issue:** No quick-reference summary for at-table use

**Impact:** During play, finding specific rules requires navigating through narrative explanations rather than consulting a condensed reference

**Location:** The book is structured for reading comprehension but lacks a dedicated reference appendix

### 4. Chapter 7: Attributes and Derived Values

**Issue:** Attribute range and advancement boundaries not immediately clear

**Impact:** Planning character progression requires cross-referencing advancement rules in later chapters

**Location:** Starting spread (2/1/1/0) is defined but ceiling values and advancement costs are deferred


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave Core Rulebook presents a coherent fiction-first system with elegant mechanics that serve narrative play well. The 4d6+Attribute resolution with Edge/Burden modifiers is mathematically sound and easy to internalize. For a veteran player accustomed to crunchier systems, this represents a deliberate trade-off: simplicity and flow over tactical depth.

The book excels at teaching its philosophy through consistent examples and clear principles. The writing maintains quality throughout, and the visual design is professional if somewhat elaborate for print reference.

As a Tactician archetype transitioning toward fiction-first play, I find the system rewarding but occasionally wish for more mechanical differentiation between characters and clearer tactical options during complex encounters. The open-ended nature that makes the system flexible also makes it harder to evaluate character builds without table-specific context.

Recommended for groups who prioritize collaborative storytelling and are comfortable with GM interpretation over mechanical arbitration. Veterans from traditional systems should expect an adjustment period but will find a well-crafted system underneath.
