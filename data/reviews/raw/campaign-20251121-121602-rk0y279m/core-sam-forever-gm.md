## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has been running games for over a decade, I rarely get excited about new systems anymore. Most promise innovation but deliver bloat. Razorweave is different.

The moment I read Chapter 21 - Running Sessions, I felt understood. The "GM Mindset" section perfectly articulates what I have been trying to explain to new GMs for years: you are a facilitator of consequences, not an adversary. The "Three Questions" framework (What do NPCs want? What do players care about? What happens if no one acts?) is the kind of practical, internalized wisdom I use every session. Seeing it formalized validates years of intuition.

The prep system is a revelation. The "Lightweight Prep" approach - reviewing active Clocks and Tags, choosing 2-3 anchors, and checking expectations with players - matches how I actually prepare for sessions now, but codifies it in a way I could teach to others. The GM Session Prep Worksheet and Campaign & Fronts Sheet look like tools I would actually use, not busywork disguised as organization.

What truly sells me is how Tags, Conditions, and Clocks work together. Instead of tracking hit points and spell slots and ammunition and a dozen other fiddly bits, I track narrative state. A location is "Dim Light" and "Crowded." An NPC is "Tense" and "Overconfident." These words do more mechanical lifting than pages of stat blocks while remaining instantly interpretable by new players.

The Resolve Clock system for combat is brilliant. No more tracking goblin #3 versus goblin #7. I describe mounting pressure, visible desperation, and decisive moments. The combat becomes a story I am telling with the players, not an accounting exercise I am managing.

There are areas where I want more. The between-session prep guidance is excellent but could use more concrete examples for different campaign types. The front/faction system introduced in Chapter 25 deserves its own expansion. And while the DC ladder is clean, I would appreciate more worked examples showing how Tags shift those DCs in complex situations.

But these are refinements, not complaints. This is the GM support book I have been waiting for.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 21 - Running Sessions

**Issue:** Between-session prep guidance lacks genre-specific examples

**Impact:** GMs new to fiction-first systems may struggle to apply the lightweight prep approach to their specific genre (horror vs cozy vs sci-fi)

**Location:** Section: Between-Session Prep

### 2. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Tag interaction with DC adjustment needs more complex examples

**Impact:** When multiple Tags apply to a situation, the guidance on stacking versus choosing is implicit rather than explicit, which could lead to table variance

**Location:** Section: Setting DCs

### 3. Chapter 22 - Running Campaigns

**Issue:** Arc pacing guidance could be more specific about session counts

**Impact:** New GMs may struggle to estimate how many sessions their planned arc will actually require

**Location:** Section: Campaign Shape and Length

### 4. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock segment sizing guidance is somewhat vague

**Impact:** GMs need clearer heuristics for sizing clocks (2-3 segments for mooks, 6+ for bosses) to maintain appropriate pacing

**Location:** Section: Resolve Instead of Hit Points


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is the best GM support I have seen in a modern fiction-first system. It respects my time, codifies practical wisdom, and gives me tools that reduce prep burden while increasing table impact. The Tags/Conditions/Clocks triumvirate is elegant and powerful. The session and campaign guidance assumes I am a competent adult who wants principles over prescriptions. Minor gaps in worked examples aside, this is the kind of rulebook that makes me excited to run games again. Score: 8.5/10 - Highly recommended for experienced GMs who want to streamline their practice and for newer GMs learning the craft.
