## Narrative Feedback

As a Method Actor with years of experience, I approached this rulebook with specific expectations. I live for those moments when the dice tell you something about who your character truly is, when mechanical outcomes force you to confront aspects of your persona you hadn't anticipated.

The book delivers on some fronts. The margin-based outcome system (Critical Success, Full Success, Partial Success, Failure, Critical Failure) gives me narrative hooks to work with. When I roll a Partial Success, I know my character achieved something but paid a cost - that's rich territory for exploring motivation and consequence. The Tags and Conditions system speaks my language: 'Frightened,' 'Exhausted,' 'Bleeding' - these are emotional and physical states I can inhabit, not just numerical penalties.

However, I'm skeptical of the 'fiction-first' claims scattered throughout. The text says Tags and Conditions 'are the names you give to things you are already describing,' but then prescribes specific mechanical effects. That's fine - I prefer mechanical teeth on my narrative tools - but don't dress it up as pure story gaming when there's clearly a simulation engine underneath.

My biggest frustration is the GM-centric design. As someone who advocates for GMless and GM-lite play, I find the constant deferral to 'the GM decides' limiting. The Clocks system, the DC setting, the outcome interpretation - all require a dedicated Game Master. Where are the collaborative mechanisms? Where's the guidance for rotating authority or shared scene framing? This isn't insurmountable, but it means I'd need to house-rule significantly to run this as the kind of distributed authority game I prefer.

The genre-agnostic approach also doesn't quite work for me. I'm a purist about genre - I want a system that deeply understands and reinforces the specific genre it's built for. The examples jumping between 'cozy towns' and 'sci-fi stations' feel scattered rather than evocative. When everything is possible, nothing feels essential.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Combat Basics - Resolve Instead of Hit Points

**Issue:** GM-centric resolution with no collaborative alternatives

**Impact:** Limits the system for GMless play; requires extensive house-ruling for rotating GM authority

**Location:** Chapter 10, Resolve Clocks section

### 2. Setting DCs

**Issue:** DC setting entirely delegated to GM with no player-facing mechanisms

**Impact:** Players cannot negotiate difficulty or propose challenges; reduces player agency in pacing

**Location:** Chapter 8, Setting DCs subsection

### 3. Genre Examples

**Issue:** Cross-genre examples dilute thematic coherence

**Impact:** Genre-specific purists may struggle to find focused guidance for their preferred setting

**Location:** Throughout Chapter 8-10 examples

### 4. Tags vs. Conditions

**Issue:** Claims fiction-first philosophy but prescribes specific mechanical effects

**Impact:** Minor philosophical inconsistency; narrative claims slightly overstate the flexibility

**Location:** Chapter 9, opening sections


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave Core Rulebook is a competent mid-crunch system with genuinely useful narrative tools. For Method Actors, the outcome tiers and Condition system provide fertile ground for character exploration. The Clock mechanics create natural dramatic arcs. However, the strong GM dependency and genre-agnostic approach don't align with my play preferences. I'd rate it serviceable for traditional GM-led campaigns but requiring significant adaptation for collaborative or genre-focused play. A solid foundation that doesn't quite reach the specific niche I occupy.
