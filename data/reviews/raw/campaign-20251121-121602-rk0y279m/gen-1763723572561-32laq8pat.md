## Narrative Feedback

As someone new to TTRPGs who likes to optimize and find powerful combinations, I found the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a mixed experience. The book talks a lot about "fiction first" and collaborative storytelling, but I'm really looking for concrete numbers and clear mechanical advantages I can leverage.

The good parts: The 4d6 dice system with Edge and Burden is interesting - I can see how stacking advantages could be powerful. The DC ladder from 12 to 22 is clear, and I appreciate the outcome tier system with Critical Success giving "extra benefit." That's what I'm looking for!

However, I struggled with several things. The Skills and Proficiencies are "open lists" which sounds cool but means I don't have a definitive catalog of options to build from. How do I know what's optimal if everything is negotiated with the GM? The book keeps saying things like "the rules are tools" and "you do not exist to serve the rules" - but I WANT clear rules to master!

The character creation gives you very limited starting stats (one at 2, two at 1, one at 0). There's not much room for specialization or building a really focused character. And the advancement chapter references "milestone" progression and "downtime projects" but doesn't give me clear XP costs or power scaling charts.

For a new player like me who learns by understanding the system mechanically first, then applying it to fiction, this book asks me to work backwards. The constant emphasis on "fiction first" feels like it's discouraging the kind of character building optimization I enjoy.

The combat chapter mentions positioning and range bands, which is helpful. But I wish there were more concrete tactical options - special moves, combo abilities, or clear power progressions I could plan toward.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Open-ended Skills and Proficiencies system lacks definitive options

**Impact:** Power gamers cannot plan optimal builds without negotiating every choice with GM, reducing agency in character optimization

**Location:** Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies subsection

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Restrictive starting Attribute spread (2/1/1/0)

**Impact:** Limited starting differentiation makes it hard for optimization-focused players to create specialized characters

**Location:** Step Three: Assign Attributes

### 3. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Edge/Burden stacking capped at +/-2

**Impact:** Cap limits mechanical depth and reduces reward for clever stacking strategies that power gamers seek

**Location:** Edge and Burden section (referenced in Glossary)

### 4. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long Term Growth

**Issue:** No concrete XP costs or power progression tables

**Impact:** Cannot plan character progression path; milestone-based advancement feels arbitrary to numbers-oriented players

**Location:** Advancement section (referenced in Table of Contents)

### 5. Core Principles throughout book

**Issue:** Excessive emphasis on 'fiction first' philosophy over mechanical clarity

**Impact:** Players who learn through mechanics-first approach may feel unsupported; harder to engage with system on preferred terms

**Location:** Chapters 1-5 Core Principles


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is clearly well-crafted for its intended audience - collaborative storytellers who want narrative flexibility. However, as a newbie power gamer, I find it challenging to engage with on my terms.

The system has solid mechanical bones - 4d6 with Edge/Burden, clear DC ladder, defined outcome tiers - but these are buried under heavy narrative philosophy that feels exclusionary to players like me who enjoy optimization and mechanical mastery.

The open-ended nature of Skills and Proficiencies, while narratively flexible, removes the clear option space I need to make informed optimization decisions. The capped advancement and Edge system prevents the kind of escalating power curves that make character building rewarding for power gamers.

For a new player specifically interested in system mastery and optimization, I would recommend waiting for community-created builds and optimization guides, or looking for a more mechanically-defined system. That said, the core resolution mechanics are sound, and if I could accept the "fiction first" philosophy, the game seems like it would run smoothly.

Rating: 5.5/10 for my playstyle, but likely 8/10 for its intended audience.
