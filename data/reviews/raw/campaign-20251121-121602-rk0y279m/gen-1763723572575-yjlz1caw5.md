## Narrative Feedback

As a Killer archetype with a few years of experience under my belt, I came to Razorweave looking for a system where I can really sink my teeth into combat and challenge myself against tough odds. The fiction-first approach is something I'm still adapting to from more traditional games, and honestly, this book makes that transition feel like walking uphill sometimes.

The core dice mechanic with 4d6 and the Edge/Burden system is elegant - I appreciate how it creates meaningful gradients of success rather than binary pass/fail. When I'm in a fight, I want to feel like my tactical choices matter, and the margin-based outcome system does deliver on that front. The DC ladder from 12 to 24+ gives me clear targets to aim for.

However, as someone who thrives on competitive play and loves the thrill of combat, I found the combat rules a bit too... narrative. The book talks extensively about "fiction first, mechanics second" but as a Killer, I WANT mechanics. I want crunch. Where are the detailed damage calculations? Where are the tactical grid options? The system seems to assume I'll be satisfied with narrative descriptions of victory, but I crave the satisfaction of optimizing builds and executing precise combat strategies.

The GMless cooperative play section is interesting to me as a GMless Advocate, but it feels underdeveloped. There's a lot of hand-waving about "rotating authority" without concrete procedures for handling contested situations or competitive elements within the group. For someone who enjoys conflict and competition, this ambiguity is frustrating.

I'm a Systems Integrator at heart, so I naturally try to see how all the pieces fit together. The Tag/Condition/Clock system is conceptually sound and creates interesting interconnections. I can see how Tags cascade into Conditions and how Clocks create mounting tension. That systematic coherence appeals to me. But the execution leans too heavily on GM adjudication for my taste.

The genre-neutral approach also conflicts with my Genre-Specific Purist preferences. I wish there were dedicated genre modules with more specific combat options rather than one-size-fits-all mechanics.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Combat rules lack tactical depth for competitive-minded players

**Impact:** Killer archetypes may feel their character optimization and tactical play is not mechanically rewarded

**Location:** Combat mechanics section - missing detailed action economy and positioning rules

### 2. Chapter 5: Ways to Play - GMless Cooperative Play

**Issue:** GMless procedures are described conceptually but lack concrete conflict resolution between players

**Impact:** GMless Advocates need clearer procedures for handling competitive or contested situations

**Location:** GMless Cooperative Play subsection - needs more structured authority rotation rules

### 3. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Edge/Burden system caps at +/-2 which limits build optimization strategies

**Impact:** Systems Integrators and Killer archetypes cannot stack advantages meaningfully beyond the cap

**Location:** Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions section

### 4. Overall Book Structure

**Issue:** No dedicated genre-specific combat supplements or modules

**Impact:** Genre-Specific Purists lack the specialized content they prefer for their chosen setting

**Location:** Throughout - system is intentionally genre-neutral without genre add-ons


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a solid fiction-first RPG system with elegant core mechanics, but it struggles to serve players like me who prioritize combat optimization and competitive play. The 4d6 + Edge/Burden resolution system is well-designed, and the systematic coherence between Tags, Conditions, and Clocks shows thoughtful game design. However, the book's insistence on narrative resolution over mechanical crunch leaves Killer archetypes wanting more tactical meat. The GMless section shows promise but needs more concrete procedures. As someone converting to fiction-first play, I find the transition smoother for social and exploration scenes, but combat still feels like it's missing the strategic depth I crave. Recommended with reservations for competitive-minded players who value tactical precision.
