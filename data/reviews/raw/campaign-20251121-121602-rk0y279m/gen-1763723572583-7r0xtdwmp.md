## Narrative Feedback

So I just tried reading through this Razorweave Core Rulebook, and honestly? It's a mixed bag for someone like me who's brand new to tabletop RPGs.

First off, the book looks really pretty with those synthwave colors and the nice layout. The electric blue and hot pink headers are cool! But when I started actually reading it, things got overwhelming pretty quickly.

The good stuff: I really appreciate how the book keeps saying "fiction first" and that I don't need to memorize everything before playing. That's reassuring! The early chapters about welcome, core concepts, and how to use the rulebook are actually pretty clear. I liked the examples they include - those help me understand what they're talking about.

But here's where I struggled: the book throws a LOT of terms at you really fast. Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, Clocks, Checks, Edge, Burden, DC, Resolve... and I'm supposed to understand how all these connect? I know they say I can learn as I go, but when I tried to figure out how to actually make a character, I kept having to flip back and forth between chapters.

The character creation chapter lists steps but then says "see Chapter X for details" a bunch of times. That's confusing when you're trying to follow along! I wanted concrete numbers and clear steps, not "refer to the later chapter about Skills." Just tell me what Skills exist and how many I pick!

The combat section actually made more sense to me because it breaks things down into Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, and Defend/Withdraw. Those are concrete actions I can understand. But then it mentions all these Tags and Conditions again without a quick reference nearby.

I think I'd need someone experienced to walk me through my first game. The book assumes you either know RPGs already or have a patient GM. For a casual gamer like me who just wants to try this out with friends who are also new... it's a lot.

The experimental part of me wants to just dive in and figure it out through play, but I genuinely don't know if I could run a session for my friends based on reading this. We'd all be lost together, which might be fun but probably frustrating too.

I need more quick-reference stuff, cheat sheets, maybe a "your first session" guide with pre-made characters and a simple adventure. The book is comprehensive, sure, but comprehensive isn't always beginner-friendly.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Character Creation Chapter

**Issue:** Step-by-step character creation keeps deferring to other chapters for details

**Impact:** New players lose momentum and get confused trying to piece together information from multiple chapters

**Location:** Chapter 6, Steps 3-5 regarding Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies

### 2. Core Concepts Section

**Issue:** Too many game terms introduced too quickly without a handy glossary nearby

**Impact:** Creates cognitive overload for newbies who need concrete numbers and clear definitions upfront

**Location:** Chapter 2, Core Concepts at a Glance

### 3. Skills and Proficiencies Reference

**Issue:** Skills and Proficiencies are referenced throughout but full lists are in Chapters 14-17

**Impact:** Constant page-flipping interrupts the learning flow for casual readers who want to see their options while creating characters

**Location:** Chapters 14-17 (referenced from Chapter 6)

### 4. Combat Section

**Issue:** Combat actions are explained well but lack a one-page quick reference summary

**Impact:** During actual gameplay, I'd need to re-read multiple paragraphs to remember what each action does

**Location:** Chapter 10, Core Combat Actions

### 5. Missing Quick Start Guide

**Issue:** No dedicated "First Session" or quick-start section for complete beginners

**Impact:** New groups without RPG experience have no easy entry point and must absorb full rules before playing

**Location:** Book-wide organizational issue

## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is clearly a labor of love with thoughtful design principles and a solid mechanical foundation. The fiction-first philosophy is appealing and the rules themselves seem internally consistent. However, as a casual gamer and complete newbie, I found the book more intimidating than inviting.

The book would benefit enormously from: (1) a quick-start section with pre-made characters and a starter scenario, (2) consolidated quick-reference sheets for character creation options, combat actions, and common Tags/Conditions, and (3) a complete character creation walkthrough that doesn't require jumping between chapters.

For experienced RPG players or groups with a veteran GM, this is probably a solid 7-8/10 book. But for newcomers like me who need concrete guidance and want to experiment our way into the hobby? It's a harder sell. I'd want to play with an experienced group first before trying to run this myself.
