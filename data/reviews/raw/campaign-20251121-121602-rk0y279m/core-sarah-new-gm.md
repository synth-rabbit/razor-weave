## Narrative Feedback

As someone brand new to GMing, I have mixed feelings about this rulebook. On one hand, I really appreciate the "fiction first" philosophy - it makes me feel like I can't mess things up too badly because the story always comes first. The book tells me multiple times that I don't need to memorize everything, which is reassuring.

The writing is clear and the examples are genuinely helpful. I especially liked the Rella character creation walkthrough - following along with a concrete example made the abstract concepts click. The Core Concepts chapter at the beginning gives me a good mental model before diving into details.

However, I'm struggling with how open-ended everything is. The Skills and Proficiencies system says I can "work with my GM to define custom entries" - but I AM the GM! Who do I work with? The book tells me to collaborate and negotiate, but as a new GM, I don't have the experience to know what's reasonable. When it says a Proficiency should be "neither so broad that it covers everything nor so narrow that it rarely matters," I honestly don't know where that line is.

The Clocks system sounds amazing in theory but I'm terrified of tracking multiple clocks while also managing the story, NPCs, and player actions. The book says "start small" but doesn't tell me exactly how small. Is one clock enough for a whole session? Three?

I love that there are no hit points - the Resolve Clock system feels more story-appropriate. But I'm worried about pacing combat without clear damage numbers. How do I know when to tick the clock?

The GM section acknowledges new GMs but still assumes a lot of intuition I don't have yet. Phrases like "present the world honestly" and "let the fiction guide" sound good but I need more concrete guidance on what to actually SAY at the table.

Overall, this feels like a system that will be wonderful once I have more experience, but right now I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the freedom it gives me. I wish there were more "training wheels" options or a starter scenario with pre-made clocks, NPCs, and scene structures.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6 - Character Creation

**Issue:** Open-ended Skill and Proficiency creation requires GM guidance that new GMs lack

**Impact:** New GMs may struggle to evaluate player proposals without established baselines

**Location:** Step Four: Choose Skills and Step Five: Choose Proficiencies - guidance says 'work with GM to define custom entries'

### 2. Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Clock management complexity not adequately scaffolded for beginners

**Impact:** New GMs may be overwhelmed tracking multiple clocks while running scenes

**Location:** What Clocks Are section - suggests using clocks for long-term goals, threats, and dangers simultaneously

### 3. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock tick guidance is too vague for new GMs

**Impact:** Without clear criteria for when to tick clocks, new GMs may struggle with combat pacing

**Location:** Resolve Instead of Hit Points section - 'successful Checks tick the Clock forward' lacks specificity

### 4. Chapter 21 - Running Sessions

**Issue:** GM guidance assumes intuition that new GMs haven't developed

**Impact:** Abstract principles like 'present the world honestly' need more concrete examples for beginners

**Location:** GM Mindset section - relies heavily on table intuition and collaborative negotiation

### 5. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** DC setting requires subjective judgment new GMs may not have calibrated

**Impact:** New GMs may set DCs inconsistently without more concrete examples per situation type

**Location:** Setting DCs section - DC ladder provided but application guidance is minimal


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a well-written, thoughtful system that prioritizes narrative over mechanical complexity. For my needs as a new GM who wants clear guidance and a Prepared Sandbox style, it scores moderately. The fiction-first approach is welcoming, the examples are helpful, and the principles are sound. However, the system's flexibility - which experienced GMs will love - creates anxiety for someone like me who doesn't yet have the experience to fill in the gaps. I need more scaffolding: starter scenarios, pre-built NPCs with example dialogue, clearer "do this, not that" guidance for common situations. The book repeatedly says "you'll learn this over time" but I need to run my FIRST session somehow. I would recommend this system for new GMs who have an experienced mentor, or for new GMs who have played (but not GMed) other narrative systems. For someone truly new to TTRPGs entirely, this might be overwhelming without additional learning resources.
