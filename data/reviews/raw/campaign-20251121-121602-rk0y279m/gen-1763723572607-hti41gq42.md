## Narrative Feedback

As a tactician who has been gaming for a couple of years now, I find Razorweave fascinating in how it structures tactical decisions within a fiction-first framework. The 4d6 system with Edge and Burden modifiers scratches my tactical itch while keeping the narrative flowing. I am evangelical about fiction-first design, so seeing mechanics that reinforce rather than replace storytelling feels validating.

The DC ladder (12-22) and margin-based outcomes create clear tactical considerations without overwhelming complexity. When I plan an approach, I can calculate risks and stack advantages through positioning - exactly what my tactical brain craves. The capped Edge/Burden system (max +/-2) prevents runaway optimization while still rewarding smart play.

However, as someone who prefers narrative tools and runs more guided campaigns, I find some sections lack the structured frameworks I need. The GM chapters offer principles but could use more concrete 'if X then Y' guidance for someone learning to improvise within bounds. The scenario design chapter helps, but I would appreciate more railroad-compatible structures for early intermediate GMs like myself.

My experimental cognitive style means I enjoy testing systems, and Razorweave invites experimentation. The genre flexibility section excites me - I can see running cyberpunk one week and fantasy the next. The VPC and faction systems give me tools to create complex tactical puzzles wrapped in story.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. GM Guidance Chapters (21-26)

**Issue:** Guidance heavily favors improvisational GMs over structured campaign runners

**Impact:** Railroad Conductor GMs may struggle to apply principles without more concrete procedures

**Location:** Chapters 21-23 general philosophy sections

### 2. Character Creation

**Issue:** Attribute spread explanation assumes familiarity with similar fiction-first systems

**Impact:** Early intermediate players from tactical RPG backgrounds may need more concrete examples of when 0/1/2 matters

**Location:** Chapter 7 Attribute Ratings section

### 3. Edge and Burden System

**Issue:** How multiple sources combine before capping could use a worked example

**Impact:** Tactically-minded players want to understand stacking rules precisely for planning

**Location:** Chapter 8 Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions section

### 4. Scenario Design

**Issue:** One-shot structure section is helpful but campaign arc scaffolding is sparse

**Impact:** GMs running guided campaigns want more templates for multi-session planning

**Location:** Chapter 23 Multi-Session Scenarios


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave delivers a tactically satisfying fiction-first system that rewards planning within narrative constraints. The 4d6 + margin system creates meaningful decisions without math-heavy resolution. For an evangelical fiction-first player who loves tactical depth, this hits the sweet spot. The Edge/Burden caps prevent optimization spirals while still rewarding smart positioning - exactly my preferred gameplay loop.

The areas for improvement mostly relate to GM support for more structured campaign styles. As a Railroad Conductor GM still building confidence, I would benefit from more explicit procedures alongside the excellent principles. The experimental nature of the system invites tinkering, which I appreciate, but a few more worked examples would help intermediate GMs like myself bridge theory and practice.

Overall, Razorweave earns strong marks for clarity and mechanical elegance. With slightly more scaffolding for guided campaign styles, it would score even higher for practical GM usability. I am excited to test this at my table and experiment with the genre flexibility it offers.
