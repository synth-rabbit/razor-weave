## Narrative Feedback

As a Forever GM who identifies primarily as a Storyteller, I approached the Razorweave Core Rulebook with particular interest in how it would support my narrative-driven games. I'm actively converting from more traditional systems to fiction-first approaches, so this rulebook arrived at a fortuitous moment in my gaming journey.

The rulebook's verbal explanations resonate strongly with how I process information. I appreciate that the designers chose to explain concepts through prose rather than relying heavily on charts and diagrams. The conversational tone makes the material feel like advice from a fellow GM rather than cold instruction. Chapter 3's explanation of how fiction and mechanics interweave is particularly well-articulated, giving me the conceptual framework I need to run sessions confidently.

As a Storyteller archetype, I was pleased to see the emphasis on collaborative narrative throughout. The Core Principles in Chapter 4 align beautifully with how I want my games to feel - players as protagonists, consequences as story fuel rather than punishment, and the GM as a facilitator rather than adversary. The "Embrace Improv" principle particularly speaks to my sensibilities.

However, my strong advocacy for GMless play modes left me wanting more. While Chapter 5 acknowledges GMless cooperative play as a valid option, the actual support for running sessions without a traditional GM feels thin. The rotating authority mechanics are mentioned but not developed in enough detail for me to confidently facilitate a purely collaborative session. As someone who often runs for groups that enjoy taking turns in the GM seat, I needed more concrete procedures here.

The Clocks mechanic is interesting but I found myself uncertain about when exactly to start one versus letting events unfold purely through fiction. The guidance exists but feels scattered across multiple chapters rather than consolidated. For a verbal processor like myself, having these related concepts explained together in flowing prose would have been more effective than hunting through cross-references.

One genuine strength is how the character creation process in Chapter 2 is explained. The open-ended nature of Skills and Proficiencies initially worried me - I've seen freeform systems go badly wrong - but the explanation of how table calibration works gave me confidence that my group could handle it. The examples of Tags particularly helped me understand what level of specificity works.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 5: Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** GMless play procedures lack sufficient detail for implementation

**Impact:** Storyteller GMs who want to run collaborative sessions without a designated GM cannot do so using this book alone; they must improvise or import procedures from other games

**Location:** GMless Cooperative Play subsection

### 2. Chapter 6: Core Mechanics - Clocks

**Issue:** Clock initiation triggers are explained conceptually but lack clear decision points

**Impact:** Forever GMs may struggle with when to introduce Clocks versus letting fiction flow, leading to inconsistent pacing across sessions

**Location:** When to Start a Clock subsection

### 3. Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Cross-referencing between principles and their mechanical implementations is fragmented

**Impact:** Verbal processors who learn through narrative explanation must piece together concepts scattered across chapters, reducing comprehension

**Location:** Entire chapter structure

### 4. Chapter 7: Scenes and Structures

**Issue:** Scene framing techniques assume traditional GM authority

**Impact:** GMs transitioning to or experimenting with shared authority models find little guidance on how to adapt scene framing collaboratively

**Location:** Framing the Scene subsection


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook succeeds admirably as a guide for GMs converting to fiction-first play from traditional systems. Its verbal, explanatory approach to teaching concepts matches how Storyteller archetypes naturally process game design ideas. The emphasis on collaborative narrative and player agency aligns with modern GMing philosophies.

However, for those of us who advocate for truly GMless or rotating-GM play, the book stops short of providing the tools we need. It acknowledges these modes exist but doesn't commit to supporting them with the same depth as traditional GM-led play. This is a meaningful gap for groups exploring alternative authority structures.

The mechanical framework is sound, and I appreciate how the designers explain the "why" behind each rule. As a Forever GM who has shepherded many systems, I can see how Razorweave would run smoothly at my table - though I would need to supplement its GMless procedures with external resources.

Final rating: 7 out of 10. An excellent entry point for narrative-focused play with room to grow in supporting alternative play structures. Recommended for GMs ready to prioritize story over simulation, with the caveat that pure collaborative play will require additional work.
