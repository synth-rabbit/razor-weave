## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has spent the better part of two decades dissecting combat systems and optimizing character builds across dozens of systems, I approached RAZORWEAVE with a specific set of expectations. The fiction-first philosophy is well-articulated and the 4d6 core mechanic with Edge/Burden modifiers shows elegant design thinking. However, I find myself hungry for more mechanical depth in the combat chapter.

The Tag and Condition system is genuinely interesting - I appreciate how it creates emergent tactical situations without prescriptive ability lists. The Clock mechanic borrowed from Blades in the Dark works well here. But for a player like me who enjoys the puzzle of tactical optimization, the system feels deliberately loose in ways that sometimes frustrate rather than liberate.

I am curious about the Edge/Burden system and how it stacks in complex multi-party conflicts. The DC Ladder is clear (DC 8 to DC 24 range), and the Outcome Tiers provide good granularity for partial successes. But the combat chapter (Chapter 10) feels undercooked compared to the thorough treatment of social and exploration mechanics. Where are my action economy details? How do I evaluate threat positioning mathematically?

The Proficiencies system shows promise for character differentiation, and I appreciate that the designers clearly understand modern RPG design principles. The acknowledgment of influences from Blades in the Dark, Fate, and PbtA games is refreshing. But the system seems to prioritize narrative players over tactical thinkers like myself.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Combat Basics (Chapter 10)

**Issue:** Combat chapter lacks the mechanical depth expected for tactical play

**Impact:** As a Killer archetype, I want to understand exact action economy, positioning rules, and how Edge/Burden interact in multi-combatant scenarios. The fiction-first approach is good for narrative flow, but insufficient for tactical planning.

**Location:** Chapter 10: Combat Basics

### 2. Character Advancement

**Issue:** Advancement Menu system is unclear on power scaling

**Impact:** For long-term campaign planning and character optimization, I need to understand the power curve. How much stronger does a character become over 10 sessions vs 50 sessions? The Advancement chapter hints at options but lacks concrete progression benchmarks.

**Location:** Chapter 19: Advancement and Long Term Growth

### 3. DC Ladder Reference

**Issue:** Edge and Burden stacking rules need clearer mathematical treatment

**Impact:** When building characters, I want to understand the expected value of investing in specific Skills vs. Proficiencies vs. seeking situational Edge. The reference sheets are helpful but the underlying probability math is not exposed.

**Location:** Chapter 27: Reference Sheets (DC Ladder section)

### 4. Skills vs Proficiencies

**Issue:** Distinction between Skills and Proficiencies could be sharper

**Impact:** For character optimization, understanding exactly when a Skill applies vs. a Proficiency matters. The current explanation relies heavily on GM interpretation, which reduces my ability to plan tactical approaches.

**Location:** Chapters 14-17: Skills and Proficiencies System

## Overall Assessment

RAZORWEAVE is a competently designed fiction-first RPG that will serve narrative-focused tables well. The core 4d6 system with Edge/Burden is mathematically sound and the Tag/Condition/Clock framework creates meaningful emergent play. However, for Killer-archetype players seeking deep tactical engagement, the system deliberately prioritizes narrative flow over mechanical crunch. I would rate this 7/10 overall - a solid system that knows what it wants to be, but not optimized for my preferred playstyle. The complexity is tolerable and even interesting, but it serves narrative purposes rather than tactical ones. I would play this with the right group, but I would supplement with house rules for combat depth.
