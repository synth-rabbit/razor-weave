## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so I finally got around to reading through the Razorweave Core Rulebook, and honestly? It's a mixed bag for me, but leaning positive.

First off, I love the vibe. The synthwave aesthetic is gorgeous - those electric blues and hot pinks really pop, and the layout feels modern and inviting. As someone who plays casually and doesn't have hours to prep, I appreciate that the book doesn't feel intimidating. The fiction-first philosophy speaks directly to my soul. I'm all about collaborative storytelling where we're building something together, not just rolling dice and counting squares.

The weave-pool system is interesting. I like that it's 2d6-based - simple to remember, easy to explain to friends who've never played TTRPGs before. The threshold system (7 for basic, 9 for hard, 11 for extreme) is the kind of concrete number I can actually hold in my head during play. That matters to me - I don't want to constantly flip back to tables.

What really excites me is how the system seems designed for GMless play. The collaborative elements, the shared narrative authority, the way threads can be woven by anyone at the table - this feels like it was built for groups like mine where we take turns facilitating. The game doesn't assume a traditional GM hierarchy, and that's refreshing.

But here's where I struggle: for a game that champions simplicity and fiction-first play, there's a lot of subsystems to track. Thread types, weave pools, different action categories... I found myself wishing for a one-page reference that just gives me the core loop. When I'm running a casual session for friends, I need to explain the whole game in under 10 minutes. I'm not sure I can do that yet.

Also, the book is LONG. Like, really long. I'm a simplicity seeker - I want the essential rules to jump out at me. Sometimes the prose, while beautiful, buries the actual mechanics I need. More callout boxes with the actual numbers would help someone like me.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Resolution

**Issue:** The basic roll mechanics are clear, but the relationship between threads and the weave pool takes too long to explain

**Impact:** When I'm trying to onboard casual players, every extra concept is a barrier to entry. I need a 'five-minute version' of the rules.

**Location:** Chapters 3-4, Thread and Weave fundamentals

### 2. GMless Play Support

**Issue:** While the system clearly supports shared authority, there's no dedicated 'GMless mode' section

**Impact:** As a GMless advocate, I'd love explicit guidance on running without a traditional GM. The support is implicit but not called out.

**Location:** GM Guidance chapter - needs a 'Facilitator Rotation' or 'GMless' sidebar

### 3. Quick Reference

**Issue:** No consolidated quick-start or cheat sheet in the book

**Impact:** Casual gamers like me need a single page we can print and reference. Having to flip through chapters mid-session breaks the flow.

**Location:** Missing from book - should be in appendix or as a dedicated sheet

### 4. Complexity Creep

**Issue:** Advanced options are interspersed with core rules rather than clearly separated

**Impact:** As a simplicity seeker, I want to know what's essential vs. optional. Hard to identify the minimal viable ruleset.

**Location:** Throughout - especially in character options and combat chapters


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is exactly the kind of game I want to love - fiction-first, collaborative, with that gorgeous synthwave aesthetic. The 2d6 core is accessible, and the philosophy aligns perfectly with how I like to play: everyone at the table building a story together, with mechanics that support rather than constrain.

For casual gamers and GMless groups, there's real potential here. The weave metaphor is evocative, and once you internalize the core loop, it flows naturally. I can see my group having amazing sessions with this.

But the book needs a "casual mode" or quick-start section desperately. Right now, the learning curve is steeper than it needs to be for the simplicity-seeking crowd. Give me a one-pager, call out the essential vs. optional rules clearly, and maybe add explicit GMless play guidance.

Verdict: Great system that's slightly over-documented for its casual-friendly philosophy. I'm buying in, but I'll be making my own cheat sheets.
