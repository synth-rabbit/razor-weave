## Narrative Feedback

As someone who approaches TTRPGs with a tactical mindset and about two years of experience under my belt, I found myself both intrigued and frustrated by the Razorweave Core Rulebook. The synthwave aesthetic is visually striking, and I appreciate the ambition of the d4-based dice pool system - it is mathematically elegant in theory. However, my skeptical nature keeps surfacing concerns.

The "Fiction First" approach is repeatedly emphasized, but I struggle to reconcile this with my need for concrete mechanical frameworks. When the book tells me to "start with narrative intent," I find myself asking: "Yes, but what are the actual probabilities of success at different Edge values?" The abstract concepts are interesting from a theoretical standpoint, but I need to see the numbers working in practice before I can trust the system.

The Edge mechanic is philosophically interesting - compressing traditional modifiers into a single unified system. But as an abstract thinker who also demands rigor, I notice the book does not provide enough worked examples showing how different Edge values statistically impact outcomes across various scenarios. I want to understand the probability curves, not just be told that "higher Edge is better."

The Weave Points and Thread Slots system shows creative design thinking, but the lack of detailed action economy breakdowns makes it difficult for me to optimize character builds or plan tactical encounters. For a game that will inevitably involve combat, the tactical resolution feels underdeveloped compared to the narrative frameworks.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Mechanics - Edge System

**Issue:** Insufficient mathematical transparency for the d4 dice pool resolution

**Impact:** As a tactician, I cannot effectively plan or optimize without understanding probability distributions. The book explains the mechanic but does not show expected success rates at different Edge values.

**Location:** Chapter 3: Core Mechanics - The d4 Dice Pool

### 2. Character Creation

**Issue:** Archetype abilities lack concrete mechanical differentiation

**Impact:** When choosing between archetypes, I cannot clearly compare their tactical strengths and weaknesses because the descriptions emphasize narrative flavor over mechanical precision.

**Location:** Chapter 5: Character Creation - Archetypes section

### 3. Combat Resolution

**Issue:** Action economy and tactical positioning rules are vague

**Impact:** For someone who enjoys the chess-like aspects of TTRPG combat, the lack of clear movement rules, opportunity attacks, and positioning advantages makes tactical planning difficult.

**Location:** Chapter 8: Conflict Resolution

### 4. GM Guidance

**Issue:** Encounter balancing guidelines rely too heavily on narrative judgment

**Impact:** As someone who prefers prepared scenarios with predictable difficulty curves, the advice to "trust the fiction" does not give me concrete tools for designing balanced challenges.

**Location:** Chapter 22: Running the Game

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents an ambitious and aesthetically cohesive cyberpunk TTRPG that clearly prioritizes narrative flexibility over tactical precision. For players who share the designers' fiction-first philosophy, this may be exactly what they want. However, as a skeptical tactician with early intermediate experience, I find the system lacks the mechanical rigor I need to feel confident running or playing it. The core d4 dice pool concept is intriguing, but without probability tables, detailed action economy rules, and concrete balancing guidelines, I cannot recommend this to players who share my tactical preferences. The book reads more like a narrative framework with dice attached than a complete game system. Rating: Promising concept that needs mechanical expansion for tactically-minded players.
