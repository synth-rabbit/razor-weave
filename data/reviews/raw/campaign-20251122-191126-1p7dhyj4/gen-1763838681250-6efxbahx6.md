## Narrative Feedback

As an experienced Power Gamer who loves to dig into system mechanics and find optimal builds, I found Razorweave's Core Rulebook to be a refreshingly different take on TTRPG design. The fiction-first approach initially made me cautious - I typically want hard numbers and clear mechanical interactions I can optimize around.

What won me over was the Weave system. The way Threads, Tensions, and the Loom interact creates genuine mechanical depth that rewards system mastery. I spent hours theory-crafting character builds around Thread synergies, which is exactly what I want from a game. The visual presentation using the synthwave color scheme (electric blue, hot pink) actually helps me parse information quickly - color-coded sections mean I can scan for the mechanical content I care about.

However, the narrative-first framing sometimes obscures the actual mechanical implications. When I'm trying to min-max a character, I need to dig through flavor text to find the concrete rules interactions. The lack of explicit numerical bounds on some abilities also makes optimization harder - "resolve narratively" is fine for some players, but I want to know exactly how powerful Thread Synthesis is.

The character sheets and reference materials are excellent for table use. I can see my options at a glance. But the rules for Weave manipulation could use more concrete examples of edge cases - what happens when multiple Threads trigger simultaneously? As someone who will definitely try to stack effects, I need clearer resolution order.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Thread Mechanics

**Issue:** Ambiguous resolution order for simultaneous Thread effects

**Impact:** As a Power Gamer, I need to know exactly when and how effects stack. Without clear priority rules, I can't reliably build around Thread synergies.

**Location:** Chapter on Thread System - Advanced Interactions subsection

### 2. Character Creation

**Issue:** Point-buy equivalence not clearly stated for narrative backgrounds

**Impact:** I want to ensure my character choices are mechanically optimal. When backgrounds give 'narrative benefits', I can't evaluate their power level compared to explicit mechanical bonuses.

**Location:** Chapter 3 - Background Selection

### 3. Combat Resolution

**Issue:** Tension economy lacks upper bounds

**Impact:** The system for building and spending Tension has strategic depth, but without caps, edge cases could break game balance. I need to know the limits to plan my combat tactics.

**Location:** Combat chapter - Tension mechanics section

### 4. Visual Design

**Issue:** Some tables lack row separators in print view

**Impact:** As a visual learner, I rely on clear table formatting to quickly reference rules during play. Dense tables without visual breaks slow me down during optimization calculations.

**Location:** Equipment tables throughout Chapter 7


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave succeeds at being a mechanically interesting system beneath its narrative-first philosophy. For Power Gamers with 3-10 years of experience, there's genuine depth to master - the Weave system rewards system knowledge and creative character building. The visual design aids rapid information processing, which matters during play. However, some mechanical ambiguities need clarification for players who want to push the system to its limits. I'd rate it 7.5/10 for my playstyle: excellent foundation, but needs errata addressing edge cases that optimization-focused players will inevitably find.
