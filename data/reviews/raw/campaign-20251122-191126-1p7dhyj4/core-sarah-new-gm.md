## Narrative Feedback

Oh wow, okay - so I just spent a good chunk of time reading through this rulebook and I have THOUGHTS. First, the good stuff: the writing is genuinely friendly and clear. I love how the book keeps reassuring me that I don't need to memorize everything before playing - that takes so much pressure off as someone who's still figuring out what being a GM even means!

The "fiction first" philosophy really resonates with me. I got into TTRPGs because I love collaborative storytelling with my friends, not because I want to do math homework. The book does a great job explaining WHY things work the way they do, which helps me understand the spirit behind the rules rather than just memorizing procedures.

Character creation is well-structured with those numbered steps (Step One through Step Nine) - I can totally see myself walking my players through that. And Rella! The example character throughout that chapter is super helpful. I kept thinking "okay, so THAT'S what that looks like in practice."

But here's where I started feeling a bit lost: the combat chapter talks about "Resolve Clocks" instead of hit points, which sounds really cool in theory, but... what do I actually SAY when someone's Resolve Clock fills up? The book tells me it depends on the stakes the table agreed to, but I'm not confident enough yet to improvise that. I kept wishing for more scripted examples like "When this happens, you might say something like..."

The Tags and Conditions chapter is conceptually great - I understand WHAT they are now - but I'm less sure about WHEN to introduce them during actual play. The GM guidance at the end of that chapter saying "start small" was helpful, but I'd love even more hand-holding for my first few sessions.

The Skills chapter felt very reference-y. I get that skills are important and the book explains them well, but my eyes started glazing over partway through. I think I'll need to come back to this chapter multiple times.

That Running Sessions chapter (Chapter 21) was interesting but felt like it was written for GMs who already know the basics and are just learning THIS system specifically. As someone who's never run a game before, I was hoping for more foundational "here's literally what to say when you sit down at the table" type guidance.

The visual design is nice though - those blue example boxes really pop, and the pink GM guidance sections are easy to spot when I'm frantically looking something up.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Combat Basics (Chapter 10)

**Issue:** Resolve Clock outcomes need more scripted examples for new GMs

**Impact:** I understand the concept of Resolve Clocks replacing hit points, but I'm uncertain what to actually narrate when a Clock fills. The book says outcomes depend on stakes, but new GMs need more concrete 'here's what you might say' examples to build confidence.

**Location:** ch-10-combat-basics, 'Resolve Instead of Hit Points' section

### 2. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks (Chapter 9)

**Issue:** Excellent concepts but timing guidance is sparse

**Impact:** I now understand WHAT Tags and Conditions are, but I'm less clear on WHEN to introduce them during play. The 'Start Small' GM guidance is helpful but I'd appreciate a flowchart or decision tree for my first sessions.

**Location:** ch-09-tags-conditions-clocks, especially the 'What Tags Do' section

### 3. Skills System Overview (Chapter 14)

**Issue:** Reference-heavy presentation may overwhelm new readers

**Impact:** The skills chapter is thorough and well-organized, but as a concrete thinker, the abstract framework felt dense. More inline examples showing skills in action at the table would help break up the conceptual explanations.

**Location:** ch-14-skills-system-overview

### 4. Running Sessions (Chapter 21)

**Issue:** Assumes baseline GM experience that new GMs may lack

**Impact:** This chapter is excellent for experienced GMs adapting to Razorweave, but as a brand-new GM, I was hoping for more foundational guidance. The 'GM Mindset' section talks about being a 'facilitator of consequences' but doesn't give me the vocabulary I need for my literal first session.

**Location:** ch-21-running-sessions, 'GM Mindset for Razorweave' section

### 5. Character Creation (Chapter 6)

**Issue:** Example character walkthrough could be expanded

**Impact:** Rella is a great example character, but the walkthrough is fairly condensed. A longer annotated version showing the player's thought process at each decision point would help me guide my players through their first character builds.

**Location:** ch-06-character-creation, example character sections


## Overall Assessment

This is a thoughtfully written rulebook that genuinely wants to help people play together. The fiction-first philosophy appeals to me as someone who cares more about collaborative storytelling than mechanical optimization. The structure is logical, the writing is accessible, and the visual design makes key information easy to spot.

For my specific situation as a new GM with zero experience, I'd rate this around a 7/10. It's GOOD - clearly well-designed and welcoming in tone. But I found myself wanting more explicit "do exactly this, then do exactly that" guidance, especially for combat and running my first session. The book is better at explaining concepts than demonstrating moment-to-moment execution.

I think experienced GMs will love the flexibility this system offers. For me though, I might need to watch some actual play videos or find a "quick start" companion guide before I feel fully confident running my first session for my friend group.

The character creation chapter is my favorite part - those numbered steps gave me a clear path to follow. If more of the GM-facing content had that same step-by-step clarity, this would be a 9/10 for me.

Bottom line: I want to play this game and I think I CAN run it, but I'll probably need to do some homework first. The rulebook has given me a solid foundation - now I just need practice and maybe some supplementary resources for true beginners.
