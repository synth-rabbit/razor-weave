## Narrative Feedback

As a hybrid GM/Player who is still converting to fiction-first approaches, I found this rulebook to be philosophically strong but mechanically sparse in ways that create friction for my playstyle.

The book excels at explaining the WHY of fiction-first play. Chapters 1-5 provide excellent conceptual grounding. The "Fiction First, Mechanics Second" principle is articulated clearly, and the examples showing how intent and approach drive resolution are genuinely helpful for understanding the paradigm shift.

However, as someone who needs concrete numbers to feel grounded, I repeatedly found myself asking "but what ARE the actual numbers?" The resolution system references Checks, outcome tiers, and Attributes (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) but the actual dice mechanics, target numbers, and probability distributions are not clearly specified in the content I reviewed. When I'm running a session, I need to know: what dice do I roll? What number do I need? How do modifiers stack?

The Skills and Proficiencies sections (Chapters 14-17) promise detailed references, and the structure suggests comprehensive coverage, but I would need explicit mechanical resolution procedures to feel confident running this. The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks system sounds elegant in theory but lacks the numerical specificity I rely on.

For exploration-focused play (my archetype), the book provides good scene-framing guidance and emphasizes player agency in discovery. Chapter 11 on Exploration and Social Play addresses my interests directly. The emphasis on "the table as creative team" resonates with how I prefer to GM sandbox-style campaigns.

What works well: The consistent structure of examples (scene > intent > approach > resolution > outcome) helps me understand the design pattern even when numbers are absent.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Missing explicit dice mechanics and target number system

**Impact:** Cannot determine probability of success or how to calibrate difficulty - critical gap for running games

**Location:** Core resolution procedure - referenced but not detailed in reviewed content

### 2. Chapter 7: Characters and Attributes

**Issue:** Attribute scale and numerical ranges not specified

**Impact:** Unable to assess what constitutes a high vs low attribute value or how they translate to dice

**Location:** Attribute definitions (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN)

### 3. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Clock advancement triggers lack numerical precision

**Impact:** As a prepared sandbox GM, I need to know exactly when clocks tick - vague guidance creates table disputes

**Location:** Clock mechanics section

### 4. Chapter 2: Core Concepts at a Glance

**Issue:** Outcome tiers mentioned but not quantified

**Impact:** Success/partial success/failure thresholds unclear - how do I know which tier a roll produces?

**Location:** Checks and Outcomes subsection

### 5. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Point-buy or allocation system not clearly defined

**Impact:** Cannot guide new players through mechanical choices without knowing budget/limits

**Location:** Step Three: Assign Attributes


## Overall Assessment

This rulebook represents a well-designed fiction-first system with strong philosophical foundations but insufficient mechanical specification for my needs as a concrete thinker transitioning from more traditional systems.

STRENGTHS:
- Excellent conceptual teaching of the fiction-first paradigm
- Clear explanation of intent/approach framework
- Good table dynamic guidance for collaborative play
- Solid chapter organization with logical progression
- Strong examples that demonstrate design patterns

GAPS FOR MY PLAYSTYLE:
- Core dice mechanics not explicitly stated
- No target number or difficulty calibration guidance
- Attribute/Skill numerical relationships unclear
- Clock advancement lacks precision
- Missing quick-reference for at-table use

VERDICT: As an Explorer who also GMs prepared sandboxes, I appreciate the emphasis on player-driven discovery and world responsiveness. However, the "needs concrete numbers" aspect of my cognitive style means I would struggle to run this confidently without supplemental mechanical reference materials. The book reads as if it assumes either (a) prior system familiarity or (b) comfort improvising numerical rulings. I am neither.

Rating: 6/10 - Philosophically compelling but mechanically incomplete for my use case. Would recommend for fiction-first veterans but not for transitioning GMs who need numerical scaffolding.
