## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been running games forever and approaches GMing as world simulation, I find myself looking at Razorweave through a very specific lens: how well does it let me challenge my players with meaningful tactical choices and clear consequences?

The writing is genuinely clear. I appreciate that they explain the four-part attribute system (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) early and stick with it consistently. The structure with Tags, Conditions, and Clocks gives me concrete tools I can actually use at the table. As a concrete thinker, I need rules I can point to and say "this is how it works" - and for the most part, Razorweave delivers that.

However, here's where my Killer archetype runs into friction with this system: the fiction-first philosophy actively works against tactical optimization. The book repeatedly emphasizes that "the story comes first" and mechanics "support the story when the outcome is uncertain and meaningful." But as someone who enjoys watching players master systems and find clever solutions, I want mechanics that reward that mastery. The system seems almost suspicious of mechanical depth.

The Check resolution system is... functional, but feels underspecified for my needs. I see outcome tiers (success, partial success, failure) but where's the tactical texture? Where are the meaningful choices between different approaches that have mechanical weight? The Skills and Proficiencies system promises depth but feels more like narrative flavor than mechanical levers I can pull.

As a World Simulator, I do appreciate the Clocks mechanic - it gives me a concrete way to track pressure and consequences. The Factions and Fronts chapter (25) aligns well with how I think about running living worlds. But I wish there was more mechanical integration between these worldbuilding tools and the core resolution system.

My curiosity drove me through the entire book looking for the crunch, and I found pockets of it - the Tags and Conditions reference (Chapter 18) has some interesting mechanical implications, the combat chapter has structure - but it never quite coalesces into the kind of tactical depth I crave.

For my table specifically, where players enjoy optimization and tactical challenges, this system would require significant GM improvisation to provide the mechanical texture we're used to.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Outcome tiers lack granular mechanical differentiation

**Impact:** Players who enjoy tactical optimization have limited ways to meaningfully improve their odds or create mechanical advantages

**Location:** Check resolution and outcome tier descriptions

### 2. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Combat lacks the tactical depth expected for 'Killer' playstyle

**Impact:** Groups focused on tactical mastery and optimization will find combat resolution too narrative and abstract for satisfying strategic play

**Location:** Combat resolution procedures

### 3. Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy may conflict with tactical play preferences

**Impact:** The explicit de-emphasis of mechanical optimization ('You do not start with a rule and then try to force the fiction to match it') alienates players who enjoy system mastery

**Location:** Fiction First, Mechanics Second principle

### 4. Chapter 14-17: Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Skills system emphasizes narrative application over mechanical depth

**Impact:** Concrete thinkers expecting clear mechanical interactions between skills find the open-ended approach frustrating

**Location:** Skills and Proficiencies reference chapters


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a well-written, clearly organized narrative-first RPG system that prioritizes collaborative storytelling over tactical depth. For groups who approach RPGs as a vehicle for emergent fiction, this system delivers exactly what it promises.

However, for my particular profile - a Forever GM with Killer-archetype preferences, World Simulator philosophy, and concrete thinking style - this system sits awkwardly. I can see the craft in it. The Clocks, Tags, and Factions systems are genuinely useful world-simulation tools. But the core resolution mechanics lack the tactical texture and optimization pathways that my tables typically enjoy.

I rate this 6.5/10 for my specific use case. It's not a bad system - it's a system designed for a different kind of play than I typically run. I could adapt it with significant house rules to add mechanical depth, but at that point I'd be fighting against the design philosophy rather than working with it. Best suited for tables that prioritize narrative emergence over tactical challenge.
