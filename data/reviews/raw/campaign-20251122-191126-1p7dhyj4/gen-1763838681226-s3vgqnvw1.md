## Narrative Feedback

As an experienced player with a Killer archetype, I approach every TTRPG system with one fundamental question: does this game give me the mechanical teeth to achieve meaningful victories? I'm someone who's been playing for several years, comfortable with abstractions, but currently converting toward more fiction-first approaches. My analytical mindset means I scrutinize systems for internal consistency and exploitability.

The Razorweave Core Rulebook presents a competent framework, but my Killer instincts immediately zeroed in on several optimization concerns. The Dice Ladder from d4 to d12 is elegantly simple, but I need to understand the probability curves before I can confidently build effective characters. The book explains what the dice do but doesn't provide the mathematical analysis I crave.

Character creation offers interesting choices with Skills, Proficiencies, and Traits, but the open-ended nature of these lists creates ambiguity. As someone who wants to build toward specific capabilities, I need clearer guidance on what constitutes a "good" choice versus a suboptimal one. The phrase "Everything Works" feels like a red flag - in my experience, some choices inevitably work better than others, and I want to identify those edges.

The Action Economy with Major, Minor, and Free Actions is solid territory for tactical optimization. I appreciate the clear definitions and the explicit statement that you can trade down from Major to Minor actions. However, I found myself wanting more examples of how to stack actions efficiently - what combinations create the most impactful turns?

Clocks as a pacing mechanism intrigue me from a strategic perspective. If I can understand how to influence Clock progression, I can better control narrative outcomes. The book explains the fiction-first philosophy around Clocks, but my analytical side wants more concrete parameters. When exactly does a segment fill? The subjective nature of Clock advancement could lead to inconsistent table experiences.

The fiction-first approach is something I'm actively embracing, but I still need mechanical clarity beneath the narrative surface. This book does a reasonable job bridging that gap, though at times the emphasis on "follow the fiction" feels like it could undercut consistent mechanical adjudication. For a Killer like me, consistency is crucial - I need to trust that my tactical decisions will yield predictable results.

Overall, this is a serviceable system with clear writing and sound structural design. But for someone seeking competitive advantage, the documentation leaves some analytical gaps unfilled.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Resolution

**Issue:** No probability breakdown for Dice Ladder outcomes

**Impact:** Analytical players cannot make informed optimization decisions without understanding success probabilities at each die tier

**Location:** The Dice Ladder subsection

### 2. Character Creation

**Issue:** Open lists lack guidance on power differentials

**Impact:** Players seeking optimal builds have no framework for evaluating which Skills or Proficiencies provide mechanical advantage

**Location:** Skills and Proficiencies lists

### 3. Action Economy

**Issue:** Limited examples of action combinations

**Impact:** Tactical players cannot plan efficient turn structures without seeing what powerful action sequences look like

**Location:** Actions During Your Turn

### 4. Clocks Mechanic

**Issue:** Advancement criteria are narratively subjective

**Impact:** Inconsistent GM interpretation of Clock progression undermines strategic planning based on Clock states

**Location:** Clocks and Progress Tracking


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave Core Rulebook delivers a coherent fiction-first system with adequate mechanical scaffolding. For a Killer archetype converting toward narrative play, it occupies a reasonable middle ground - enough crunch to satisfy tactical impulses, enough narrative flexibility to explore fiction-first engagement. However, the lack of explicit probability analysis and optimization guidance leaves analytical players working with incomplete information. The writing is clear and the structure logical, making the system learnable, but experienced optimizers will need to derive their own mathematical frameworks. Solid 7/10 for my use case - functional with room for deeper mechanical documentation.
