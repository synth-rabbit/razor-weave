## Narrative Feedback

As someone who lives and breathes character immersion, I find myself genuinely excited by what Razorweave is attempting here. The fiction-first philosophy isn't just lip service - it's woven into the very structure of how the rules are presented. When I read phrases like "You do not exist to serve the rules. The rules exist to support your story," I feel seen as a player who prioritizes narrative authenticity over mechanical optimization.

The emphasis on Intent and Approach as the foundation for all mechanical resolution is exactly what I look for in a system. As a Method Actor, I need to understand my character's motivations before I ever touch a die, and this system explicitly builds that into its resolution framework. The examples consistently demonstrate characters acting from genuine motivation rather than hunting for mechanical advantage.

From my Hybrid GM/Player perspective, I appreciate how the book addresses both roles without assuming you're only one or the other. The GM Guidance callouts provide insights that help me think about running the game, while the player-facing examples help me imagine inhabiting a character within this world.

However, my Systems Integrator brain keeps looking for the connective tissue between subsystems. The book promises that "Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks all connect" to a single resolution structure, but I found myself flipping back and forth to see exactly how these pieces snap together. The individual components are well-explained, but the gestalt - the way they form a coherent whole - could be demonstrated more directly.

As an Evangelical player, I want to share this game with my tables. The writing is accessible and the principles are compelling. I could hand the first five chapters to any skeptic of narrative games and watch them come around. But I worry that the practical implementation sections - the actual "how do I run this at the table" moments - are less immediately graspable.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Resolution Integration

**Issue:** The relationship between the resolution system components (Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, Clocks) is explained conceptually but lacks a clear integration diagram or summary showing how they interact in a single Check.

**Impact:** As a Systems Integrator, I need to see how the pieces fit together holistically. Without a clear integration view, I find myself mentally constructing this map while reading, which slows comprehension and makes it harder to teach others.

**Location:** Chapters 6-13, specifically the transition between character components and resolution mechanics

### 2. GM Guidance Depth

**Issue:** The GM-facing content in the early chapters establishes principles beautifully but provides limited concrete procedural guidance for common situations like pacing scenes, calibrating difficulty, or managing spotlight distribution.

**Impact:** As a Hybrid GM/Player, I want to run this game as much as play it. The philosophy is clear, but translating "present the world honestly" into moment-to-moment decisions at the table requires more scaffolding than currently provided in the core chapters.

**Location:** Chapter 4 (Core Principles of Play) and Chapter 21-26 (GM Tools section)

### 3. Failure and Partial Success Examples

**Issue:** While the book states that "Failure creates momentum" and provides a few examples, the ratio of success examples to failure/partial success examples feels imbalanced. Method Actors need to understand how character development occurs through setbacks.

**Impact:** I learn to play a character through their struggles as much as their triumphs. More examples showing how failure bends the story (rather than breaking it) would help me trust the system to support dramatic, character-driven play.

**Location:** Chapter 4, Example blocks throughout the text

### 4. Character Arc Integration with Mechanics

**Issue:** The character creation chapter focuses on initial construction but doesn't clearly connect to advancement and change over time. For a fiction-first game, the mechanical support for character growth through play feels underemphasized in the core chapters.

**Impact:** As a Method Actor, my character's arc is sacred. I need to see how the system mechanically supports transformation, growth, and the resolution of character threads over a campaign's duration.

**Location:** Chapter 6 (Character Creation) and Chapter 18-20 (Advancement and progression content)

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave Core Rulebook is a thoughtfully designed system that genuinely embodies its fiction-first philosophy. For a Method Actor with Hybrid GM/Player experience, this is the kind of game I've been waiting for - one that treats narrative immersion as foundational rather than optional. The writing is clear, the principles are compelling, and the core resolution structure promises elegant play.

The system earns high marks for Persona Fit because it explicitly values what I value: character motivation driving mechanical engagement, collaborative storytelling, and meaningful consequences that serve the narrative rather than punishing players. The Evangelical tone of the early chapters gives me confidence I could bring skeptical players into this game.

Where the book falls slightly short is in the practical integration of its many components. The individual pieces are well-crafted, but the holistic view - how everything works together at the table, how failure actually plays out in extended examples, how character arcs mechanically evolve - requires some assembly by the reader. For a Systems Integrator, this creates friction that could be smoothed with better integration content.

Recommended for tables that prioritize narrative depth and character-driven play. Would benefit from supplementary "integration guides" or extended play examples in future editions.
