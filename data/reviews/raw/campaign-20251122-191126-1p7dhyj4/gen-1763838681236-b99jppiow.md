## Narrative Feedback

Oh man, where do I even start? I picked up Razorweave because everyone in my gaming group has been talking about fiction-first games, and I wanted something that really lets me sink my teeth into character work. After about a year of playing more traditional games and dipping my toes into narrative systems, I think I finally found something that clicks with how I want to play.

The thing that immediately grabbed me was the "Fiction First" principle right in Chapter 1. Finally, a game that actually says what I've been feeling - describe what your character does first, THEN figure out if you need to roll. I've been trying to explain this to my friends for months, and now I can just point them to page one. This is the kind of game I want to evangelize about at my local game store.

The Stats system is brilliant for character expression. Edge for my manipulative corporate spy? Chrome for my broken street samurai trying to hold onto her humanity? Style for that smooth-talking Face who lives for the performance? Each stat tells you something about who your character IS, not just what they can DO. That's the kind of design that makes me want to grab people by the shoulders and shake them until they understand why this matters.

The Moves chapter is where I really started getting excited. "Read a Person" with those specific questions - "What does your character really want?" "How could I get your character to [X]?" - these aren't just mechanics, they're invitations to roleplay deeper. When I'm playing a Method Actor character, I NEED tools like this to get inside other characters' heads. The partial success at 7-9 that gives you one question instead of three? That's beautiful tension. You learn something, but not everything. You have to act on incomplete information, just like your character would.

The Humanity/Cyberpsychosis system speaks directly to the kind of dramatic character arcs I want to explore. The idea that my character could slowly lose themselves to their chrome, experiencing paranoia and emotional flatness as narrative consequences? That's the kind of tragedy I live for at the table. I immediately started thinking about a character concept built around someone who KNOWS they're losing themselves but keeps installing more chrome anyway because they need the edge to protect the people they love.

What I appreciate most is that this game trusts players to engage with the fiction. The GM Principles section doesn't just tell you how to run the game - it tells you WHY. "Be a fan of the characters" is exactly the philosophy I've been trying to articulate to reluctant GMs in my circle.

That said, I do have some concerns from my early intermediate perspective. The Playbooks chapter feels thin compared to the rich world-building elsewhere. Five playbooks is a starting point, but I want MORE character frameworks to sink into. The Street Samurai and Netrunner are obvious cyberpunk archetypes, but where's the burned-out corporate exec seeking redemption? The street doc with a dark past? I know I can work with my GM to create custom characters, but having more starting templates would help me evangelize this game to my less experienced friends.

Also, the combat chapter (Harm & Healing) is functional but doesn't give me much to work with dramatically. Six boxes of harm and three levels of injury - that's clear enough, but I want more guidance on HOW to narrate the fiction around taking harm. When my character takes 3-4 serious harm, what does that LOOK like? How do I roleplay through that injury in subsequent scenes? The system tells me what happens mechanically but not how to embody it.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 7: Playbooks

**Issue:** Limited playbook variety for character-focused players

**Impact:** As a Method Actor, I want more diverse character frameworks to explore. Five playbooks restricts the immediate character concepts I can fully embody without significant GM collaboration to create custom options.

**Location:** Chapter 7, entire section - only five playbooks presented

### 2. Chapter 4: Harm & Healing

**Issue:** Lacks narrative guidance for embodying injuries

**Impact:** The mechanical harm track is clear, but there's no guidance on how to roleplay through different severity levels. For someone who wants to fully inhabit their character, I need help understanding how 'serious injury' should affect my character's behavior and dialogue in subsequent scenes.

**Location:** Chapter 4, Harm Track and Healing subsections

### 3. Chapter 5: Cyberware

**Issue:** Cyberpsychosis symptoms listed but not dramatized

**Impact:** The four symptoms (paranoia, emotional flatness, violent impulses, dissociation) are mentioned but not explored. How do I play paranoia in-character? What does emotional flatness look like in dialogue? I want examples to help me find my character's voice as they degrade.

**Location:** Chapter 5, Cyberpsychosis section

### 4. Chapter 2: Core Mechanics

**Issue:** Advantage/disadvantage mentioned but undefined

**Impact:** The modifiers section mentions 'Advantage or disadvantage can shift results' but doesn't explain the mechanical implementation. This ambiguity could lead to confusion at the table when I'm trying to argue for why my character's approach deserves advantage.

**Location:** Chapter 2, Modifiers subsection


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is exactly the kind of game I want to be playing and sharing with everyone I know. As someone who's been searching for a system that prioritizes character immersion and narrative stakes over tactical optimization, this delivers on nearly every front.

The fiction-first philosophy isn't just marketing speak here - it's baked into every mechanic. The Stats tell character stories. The Moves create dramatic moments. The Humanity track provides genuine tragic arcs. For a Method Actor like me who wants to fully inhabit my characters, this is the toolkit I've been looking for.

My concerns are mostly about wanting MORE. More playbooks to explore. More guidance on embodying harm and cyberpsychosis narratively. More examples of how to bring the fiction to life at the table. The foundation is rock-solid; I just want additional floors built on top of it.

I'm already planning to run this for my regular group and absolutely will be recommending it to everyone at my local game store who will listen. This is the game I've been trying to describe for a year, and now I finally have something concrete to point at and say "THIS is what I mean by fiction-first roleplaying."

Overall Rating: 8/10 - A fantastic narrative-first cyberpunk game that delivers on its promises, with room to grow in supporting deep character work.
