## Narrative Feedback

As a Killer-archetype player who thrives on tactical challenges and optimizing character builds, I approached the Razorweave Core Rulebook with considerable skepticism. I've both run and played in dozens of systems, and what I need from a rulebook is clear mechanical edges I can exploit and optimize around. The fiction-first philosophy that this book evangelizes is something I've come to appreciate - when done well, it creates more interesting tactical situations than pure number-crunching - but the implementation here leaves me wanting.

The writing is genuinely clear. Chapter organization is logical, and I appreciate that the book acknowledges different learning styles and doesn't demand front-to-back reading. The Core Principles section does an excellent job explaining the fiction-first approach, and I found myself nodding along to the "Begin and end in the fiction" principle. This is the right way to frame narrative mechanics for someone like me who wants to understand *why* these rules work, not just what they are.

However, here's where my frustration begins: I need concrete numbers to evaluate tactical choices, and this book is maddeningly vague in places where precision matters. The Checks system with d6 pools is explained well conceptually, but the guidance on setting Difficulty and Opposition is loose. As someone who runs games as a World Simulator - creating consistent, predictable environments for players to strategize against - I need harder guidelines. What makes something Difficulty 4 vs Difficulty 5? The book says the GM decides, but doesn't give me the framework to make consistent decisions.

The character creation system, with its open lists for Skills and Proficiencies, is both a strength and a weakness. I love the flexibility - it lets me build precisely the character concept I want. But as a complexity-tolerant player who enjoys mechanical depth, I'm disappointed that the system doesn't reward mastery. There's no equivalent of feat trees, combo synergies, or build optimization paths. The Tags and Edges systems hint at depth but don't deliver the kind of tactical decision-making I crave.

The Clocks mechanic is excellent - transparent progress tracking that I can strategize around. The Consequences system is similarly well-designed for tactical play. But the broader resolution mechanics feel squishy. When I spend Edges, what exactly am I getting? The answer "narrative permission" isn't satisfying to someone who wants to calculate odds and make informed decisions.

My biggest complaint: the book heavily emphasizes collaborative narrative authority, but doesn't acknowledge that some players (like me) want to optimize within clearly defined constraints. The tone sometimes feels like it's trying to convert me away from tactical play rather than showing me how fiction-first can enhance it.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 4: Making a Check

**Issue:** Difficulty and Opposition guidelines lack precision

**Impact:** GMs who want to run consistent, predictable worlds cannot ensure fair and balanced challenges without extensive house-ruling

**Location:** Setting the Check subsection

### 2. Character Creation

**Issue:** No mechanical depth for optimization-focused players

**Impact:** Killer-archetype players have no meaningful build choices to explore after initial creation - the system doesn't reward system mastery

**Location:** Skills, Proficiencies, and Tags sections

### 3. Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Fiction-first framing dismissive of tactical play styles

**Impact:** Players who enjoy optimization may feel alienated by the book's implicit assumption that narrative play is superior to gamist play

**Location:** Fiction First, Mechanics Second principle

### 4. Chapter 6: Edges and Resources

**Issue:** Edge expenditure outcomes too narratively ambiguous

**Impact:** Players cannot make informed tactical decisions about resource expenditure when outcomes are GM-determined rather than mechanically defined

**Location:** Spending Edges subsection

### 5. Chapter 5: Ways to Play

**Issue:** World Simulator GM style underserved by the text

**Impact:** GMs who want to adjudicate fairly and consistently lack the mechanical frameworks to do so without inventing their own subsystems

**Location:** GM Guidance and Play Mode descriptions


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a thoughtful fiction-first system with genuinely clear writing and smart organizational choices. For players who enjoy narrative emergence and collaborative storytelling, it's likely excellent. However, as a Killer-archetype player who values tactical depth, mechanical precision, and optimization opportunities, I find the system frustratingly soft in the places where I want hard edges.

The book succeeds at explaining *what* fiction-first play is and *why* it works. But it fails to show *how* tactical players can engage with these principles on their own terms. I'm complexity-tolerant - I can handle dense rules - but this book gives me nothing to sink my teeth into beyond the core resolution mechanic.

Rating: 6/10 for my playstyle. The Clocks and Consequences systems show real promise, and the writing quality is high. But without clearer mechanical boundaries, difficulty guidelines, and optimization paths, I can't recommend this to fellow Killer players. I'd need significant house-ruling to run this as the kind of consistent, tactically interesting World Simulator game I prefer. The foundation is solid, but it needs more crunch to satisfy players like me.
