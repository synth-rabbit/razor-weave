## Narrative Feedback

So I picked up this Razorweave rulebook because my friends convinced me to try tabletop gaming after years of playing RPGs on my PC and console. I figured if I can master Dark Souls, learn Final Fantasy job systems, and min-max builds in Path of Exile, a tabletop game should be straightforward, right? Well, after reading through this book, I have some serious concerns as a new player coming from video games.

First, let me say what I do appreciate: the book is organized logically. There is a table of contents, chapters are numbered, and I can generally find what I am looking for. The basic concept of rolling dice and adding numbers to beat a target is familiar enough from my video game experience. The 4d6 plus Attribute plus Skill versus DC system makes intuitive sense when I map it to my mental model of how RPG stats work.

But here is where I start getting frustrated. In video games, when I level up, I get concrete choices: plus five to strength, unlock this ability, gain these stats. The character creation in Chapter 6 tells me to assign a 2, 1, 1, and 0 to my four attributes. That is it? A plus 2 maximum? In most video games, starting stats range from 8 to 18 at minimum. And there is no clear progression table showing me what happens at level 2, level 5, level 10. Where is the experience point chart? Where do I see my character growing numerically?

The Skills system completely threw me off. Chapter 14 talks about Skills and Proficiencies but then tells me I can basically define my own Skills? That feels like there are no rules at all. In Skyrim, there are specific skill trees. In Final Fantasy, there are defined job abilities. Here, I am supposed to invent my own and hope the GM approves them? What if two players define overlapping Skills differently? What happens to game balance? This lack of standardized progression is really unsettling for someone who expects their +10 Sword of Flaming to mean the same thing every time.

Speaking of balance, I went looking for damage numbers and could not find them in the way I expected. Combat in Chapter 10 talks about Clocks instead of hit points. I have over 500 hours in games with HP bars. The idea that my character does not have a number that goes down when hit feels completely alien. The book says Resolve Clocks track "escalating pressure" but I cannot tell if my 4-segment Clock is good or bad compared to another player's. Where is the equivalent of Constitution or Vitality giving me more HP?

The Edge and Burden system is an interesting mechanic that I can somewhat map to buffs and debuffs in video games. Getting advantage or disadvantage on rolls makes sense. But the book never gives me a complete list of all possible Edges and Burdens. In a video game, I could open a menu and see every status effect with its exact numerical impact. Here, I have to trust the GM to apply them consistently. That makes me nervous.

Chapter 15 covers Talents and Specializations, which is the closest thing to a talent tree I found. But again, the progression feels vague. When exactly do I get new Talents? The book talks about "character advancement" but I could not find a centralized experience or leveling table. In every video game I play, there is an XP bar that fills up and then I get a level. Where is that here?

The GM-facing chapters honestly scared me a bit. Chapters 21 through 26 are all about how the GM runs the game, makes rulings, sets difficulty. This means so much of what happens depends on another person's interpretation rather than coded game rules. In a video game, the computer calculates damage formulas the same way every time. Here, the GM decides if climbing that wall is DC 14 or DC 18? What stops them from just making things arbitrarily harder?

I will say the Quick Reference Sheets in the appendix are genuinely useful. Having the core resolution, DC ladder, and action list on a single page is exactly what I need at the table. This is like having a HUD overlay with all my key stats visible. More of this throughout the book would have helped.

The Conditions system in Chapter 16 with things like Slowed, Restrained, and Blinded actually makes sense to me because it reminds me of status effects in JRPGs. This is concrete mechanical information I can work with. But then Tags feel less defined, more like keywords that might mean different things in different contexts.

Overall, my biggest struggle is that this book assumes a comfort level with improvisation and collaborative fiction that I do not have. I want clear rules, defined progression, and predictable outcomes. Razorweave seems designed for players who want flexibility over predictability, which is the opposite of what drew me to RPGs in the first place. When I play a game, I want to learn its systems deeply and optimize within them. This system seems to actively resist that playstyle.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** No visible experience or leveling progression system

**Impact:** Players from video game backgrounds expect a clear XP-to-level table showing exactly when they advance and what they gain. The absence of this makes long-term character growth feel undefined and unmotivating for achievement-oriented players.

**Location:** Step Four and onwards

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Attribute range of 0-2 feels extremely flat

**Impact:** Video game players expect meaningful stat differentiation. A maximum of +2 versus +0 does not create the dramatic mechanical identity that makes character builds feel distinct. Compare to video games where stats can range across dozens of points.

**Location:** Step Three: Assign Attributes

### 3. Chapter 14: Skills System Overview

**Issue:** Open-ended Skill definition lacks standardization

**Impact:** New players from structured video game systems will struggle without a defined Skill list. Custom Skills create inconsistency between tables and make it hard to compare characters or follow online guides and discussions.

**Location:** Creating Custom Skills

### 4. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Clock-based health instead of hit points is counterintuitive

**Impact:** Players with thousands of hours managing HP bars will find abstract Clocks confusing. The book does not adequately explain how Clock segments map to the visceral feedback of seeing numbers decrease in video games.

**Location:** Resolve and Harm

### 5. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** No comprehensive Edge/Burden reference table

**Impact:** Video game players expect a complete list of all buffs and debuffs with their exact effects. The scattered presentation of Edge and Burden triggers makes it hard to strategize and plan character actions.

**Location:** Edge and Burden subsection

### 6. Chapter 15: Talents and Specializations

**Issue:** Talent acquisition timing is unclear

**Impact:** Without knowing exactly when Talents are earned, players cannot plan builds or set progression goals. Video games always show unlock requirements clearly; this book leaves it ambiguous.

**Location:** Gaining New Talents

### 7. Chapter 21-26: GM Chapters

**Issue:** Too much mechanical authority delegated to GM discretion

**Impact:** Players accustomed to video games where rules are computed consistently will feel anxious about GM-dependent rulings. The book should provide more objective benchmarks to reduce perceived arbitrariness.

**Location:** Throughout GM sections

### 8. General

**Issue:** No character build examples or optimization guides

**Impact:** Achiever-type players want to see example builds, synergies, and effective strategies. The book focuses on fiction and narrative without providing the mechanical analysis that helps players feel they are mastering the system.

**Location:** Throughout book


## Overall Assessment

Coming to Razorweave from video game RPGs has been a challenging experience. The book is competently written and clearly organized, which I appreciate. But the fundamental design philosophy clashes with what I expect from a rules system.

My core concerns are: (1) Character progression lacks concrete milestones like XP tables and level-up charts. (2) The flat attribute spread (0-2) does not create meaningful build differentiation. (3) Custom Skills instead of a defined list creates inconsistency. (4) Clocks replace the HP bars I understand intuitively. (5) Too many rulings depend on GM interpretation rather than objective rules.

I recognize this is a fiction-first game designed for collaborative storytelling. But as someone who came to RPGs because I loved optimizing builds, mastering systems, and achieving measurable progression in video games, Razorweave does not meet my needs. I want to feel like I am getting better at the game through system mastery, not through improvisation skills.

The Quick Reference Sheets and the Conditions system are genuinely useful and more of this structured, concrete information would improve the experience for players like me. If the book included: (a) a clear advancement table, (b) defined Skill lists with explicit scope, (c) numerical benchmarks for Clocks, and (d) more example builds showing mechanical synergies, I would be much more comfortable recommending it.

As it stands, I would suggest new players from video game backgrounds start with a more structured tabletop system first, then potentially move to Razorweave once they understand how tabletop games differ from video games in their approach to rules and storytelling.

Final Rating: 5/10 - Well-organized but philosophically misaligned with players who want concrete progression systems and predictable mechanics.
