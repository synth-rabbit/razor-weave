## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been playing TTRPGs for about two years now, mostly in a casual capacity with friends, I found the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a solid but sometimes overwhelming read. I'm actively trying to move toward more fiction-first play after years of crunchier games, so the philosophy resonated with me even when the execution felt abstract.

The good news is the book tells you right away in Chapter 3 that you don't need to memorize everything. That's reassuring. The "Learn in Layers" approach works for me - I can grasp the basics and come back for specifics. The writing is generally clear, and I appreciate that examples are sprinkled throughout showing how the rules play out at an actual table.

What works well for my casual gaming style is the simple four-attribute system (Might, Agility, Presence, Reason). That's easy to remember. The core resolution loop seems straightforward - describe what you're doing, roll if there's meaningful uncertainty, interpret the outcome. I can explain that to my friends who've never played before.

However, as a concrete thinker, I struggled with some of the more abstract explanations. When the book talks about "intent and approach" driving everything, I understand the concept, but I wanted more specific examples of how to actually DO that at the table. Chapter 4 on Core Principles is full of good ideas but feels philosophical rather than practical. I kept thinking "okay, but what do I actually say when my player wants to do something?"

The Skills and Proficiencies system worried me. Chapter 6 says players can create their own entries from "open lists" and that this is fine because the system is "stable against poor choices." As a relatively new GM who prefers to prepare my sandbox worlds ahead of time, that's terrifying. I don't trust myself to evaluate custom Skills on the fly. I would have preferred more comprehensive default lists with guidance on when to allow custom entries.

The chapter on Tags, Conditions, and Clocks (Chapter 9) introduces interesting tools, but the explanations felt abstract. Clocks especially - I understand they're "visual trackers" but I wanted step-by-step guidance on when exactly to create one and how many segments to use. The book says to use judgment, but my judgment isn't calibrated yet.

One thing I really appreciated was the honest acknowledgment of different play modes in Chapter 5. I'm glad to see solo play and GMless play mentioned as supported modes, though the GMless section felt underdeveloped compared to traditional GM play.

The combat chapter was clearer than I expected. The positioning system with Zones makes sense spatially, which helps my concrete thinking. I can actually picture where everyone is without needing a detailed map.

Overall, this book is clearly written by someone who knows the system deeply. The challenge is translating that deep knowledge into guidance for someone like me who's still learning. The principles are sound, but I sometimes needed more hand-holding on the practical application.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Abstract explanations without sufficient concrete procedural guidance

**Impact:** Players new to fiction-first games may understand the philosophy but struggle to apply it at the table without more explicit 'how-to' examples

**Location:** Intent and Approach discussion

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Open lists for Skills and Proficiencies require GM adjudication that inexperienced GMs may not feel equipped to handle

**Impact:** Casual groups without experienced GMs may create unbalanced characters or feel paralyzed by choice, despite assurances the system is 'stable'

**Location:** Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies subsection

### 3. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Clocks lack concrete procedural guidance on segment counts and trigger conditions

**Impact:** GMs must rely on judgment they haven't developed yet; Clocks may be underused or inconsistently applied across sessions

**Location:** Clocks section

### 4. Chapter 5: Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** GMless Cooperative Play section mentions rotating authority but provides insufficient procedural detail

**Impact:** Groups interested in GMless play cannot run it confidently with only this book; they need external resources or significant improvisation

**Location:** GMless Cooperative Play subsection

### 5. Chapter 3: How to Use This Rulebook

**Issue:** The 'Learn in Layers' approach is helpful but could benefit from explicit 'start here' reading paths for different player types

**Impact:** New players may still feel overwhelmed despite the book's assurances; a one-page quick-start reference would help

**Location:** Learning the Flow of the System subsection


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook presents a thoughtful fiction-first system with clear principles and a sensible mechanical foundation. For someone like me - a casual gamer converting from crunchier systems to narrative play - it provides a solid philosophical framework. The four-attribute system is accessible, the core resolution loop is understandable, and the writing generally respects the reader's intelligence without being condescending.

However, the book sometimes assumes more experience than a casual or early-intermediate player might have. The open-ended nature of Skills and Proficiencies, while elegant in theory, creates anxiety for GMs who haven't developed calibrated judgment yet. The abstract discussions of principles would benefit from more concrete "at the table" scripts and procedures.

I rate this 7 out of 10 for my use case. It's a book I'll need to study and grow into rather than pick up and play immediately. The prepared sandbox GM in me appreciates the tools for Clocks and Tags, even if I need more guidance on calibrating them. For casual groups willing to invest time in learning the system's philosophy, this is a worthwhile foundation. For groups wanting to jump in quickly with minimal preparation, the learning curve may be steeper than expected.
