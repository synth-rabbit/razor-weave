## Narrative Feedback

After running old-school games for nearly two decades—systems where player skill, resource management, and tactical positioning determine whether your character lives or dies—I approached the Razorweave Core Rulebook with professional skepticism. I have seen plenty of fiction-first systems promise flexibility while delivering GM fiat dressed up in fancy terminology. Here is what I found.

The book is well-organized, I will grant that immediately. The chapter progression from Core Concepts through Character Creation to Actions and Checks follows logical pedagogy. Chapter 3 on How to Use This Rulebook is particularly useful for explaining the fiction-first mindset to readers who may not share it. The writing is clear, direct, and avoids the self-congratulatory tone that plagues many indie games. That earns points.

The core resolution mechanic is mathematically sound: 4d6 plus Attribute plus Skill versus a DC ladder ranging from 12 (routine) to 22 (legendary). The bell curve of 4d6 produces consistent, predictable results that reward investment. Edge and Burden providing flat +2/-2 modifiers rather than DC adjustments keeps the math transparent. These are solid mechanical bones that any experienced GM can work with.

However, my central concern crystallizes around the attribute spread during character creation: 2/1/1/0. This produces characters who are fundamentally similar in capability. The difference between a +2 and a +0 on a 4d6 roll against DC 16 shifts success probability from roughly 67% to roughly 53%. That is not dramatic specialization—that is mild preference. In B/X, a fighter with 18 Strength versus one with 8 Strength represents a fundamental difference in combat capability. Here, everyone can attempt everything with only marginal penalty.

Chapter 10 on Combat Basics is where I expected to find tactical depth. Instead, I find Resolve Clocks replacing hit points, with the explicit justification that this keeps combat "aligned with the story." The four combat actions—Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw—are reasonable abstractions, but without positioning rules, weapon differentiation, or action economy constraints, combat becomes narrative description punctuated by occasional dice rolls. Where are the meaningful tactical decisions? Where is the system mastery that rewards players who engage deeply with the rules?

The book explicitly uses "conversational order" or "popcorn initiative" rather than discrete initiative tracking. While this may feel naturalistic, it removes the tactical consideration of action order that creates interesting combat decisions. When everyone acts in the order that "feels right," the GM is implicitly making tactical decisions that should belong to the players.

The Skills and Proficiencies system presents a philosophical problem for my style of play. Chapter 14 encourages custom Skill creation with GM approval, stating that skills should have "clear scope" and "fit your genre." But where are the calibration examples? How do I know if a proposed Skill is too broad ("Social Manipulation") or too narrow ("Identifying Rare Mushrooms in Temperate Forests")? The text says the GM has "final approval over scope," but provides no rubric for that approval. This invites table conflict and inconsistent rulings.

Tags and Conditions represent the strongest mechanical element in the book. The shared vocabulary of environmental modifiers—Dim Light imposing Burden, Solid Cover granting Edge—creates a framework that any GM can apply consistently. Chapter 18's extended reference provides enough examples to calibrate rulings. If the entire system had this level of concreteness, I would be more enthusiastic.

Clocks are a clever abstraction that I appreciate. The dual-clock structure showing Investigation versus Cover-Up creates genuine tension and visible progress. This is one area where the abstraction serves clear procedural purposes rather than simply deferring to "whatever makes sense narratively."

Chapter 21 on Running Sessions concerns me most. The chapter opens by calling the GM a "facilitator of consequences" and emphasizes "fiction first" over procedural structures. The Three Questions guidance—"What do the NPCs want? What do the players care about? What would happen if no one acted?"—is philosophical rather than procedural. Compare this to the concrete procedures in classic games: dungeon turns with random encounter checks, reaction rolls for NPCs, morale checks for enemies. These procedures remove GM bias from moment-to-moment decisions and create a world that feels objective and discoverable.

What I want to find in a GM chapter: When an NPC attacks, what exactly happens mechanically? When the party splits, how do I handle time passage? When a Clock fills, what are my specific options? The answers in Razorweave are consistently variants of "interpret the fiction" and "do what makes sense for the story." This trusts the GM to improvise everything, which means players are experiencing my creative decisions rather than exploring a simulated world with discoverable rules.

The book succeeds at what it attempts: a fiction-first system for collaborative storytelling with mechanical structure. The prose is clear, the examples are helpful, and the underlying math is functional. But for my table—where player skill determines outcomes within a world that operates on consistent, discoverable rules—Razorweave trades too much procedural clarity for narrative flexibility.

If future supplements added encounter procedures, treasure generation, reaction tables, and optional combat complexity, I would reconsider. As written, this is a story game with tactical elements, not a tactical game that supports emergent storytelling.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Attribute spread of 2/1/1/0 produces mathematically flat characters

**Impact:** The +2 maximum difference on 4d6 creates roughly 14% variance in success probability. Characters lack the dramatic mechanical differentiation that rewards tactical party composition and specialized character builds.

**Location:** Step Three: Assign Attributes

### 2. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** DC setting relies on qualitative guidance rather than objective benchmarks

**Impact:** GMs must interpret 'routine' through 'legendary' without concrete reference points. Different GMs will calibrate the same fictional situations to different DCs, undermining player ability to predict and plan around difficulty.

**Location:** Setting DCs subsection

### 3. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clocks replace granular damage tracking without tactical alternatives

**Impact:** Combat lacks weapon differentiation, armor mechanics, positioning rules, or action economy constraints. Players cannot make meaningful tactical choices about equipment or positioning because these exist only in narrative.

**Location:** Resolve Instead of Hit Points

### 4. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Conversational and popcorn initiative remove tactical order consideration

**Impact:** When action order is determined by narrative flow rather than mechanical procedure, players lose the ability to make tactical decisions about when to act relative to allies and enemies.

**Location:** Turns and Order

### 5. Chapter 14: Skills System Overview

**Issue:** Custom Skill creation lacks scope calibration rubric

**Impact:** Without clear examples of too-broad versus too-narrow Skills, different tables will allow wildly different Skill scopes, creating inconsistent play experiences and potential table conflict.

**Location:** Creating Custom Skills

### 6. Chapter 21: Running Sessions

**Issue:** GM procedures are philosophical rather than mechanical

**Impact:** Absence of concrete procedures—encounter checks, reaction tables, morale systems—means the GM must improvise all world responses, removing the objective simulation that OSR-style play requires.

**Location:** GM Mindset for Razorweave

### 7. Chapter 7: Characters and Attributes

**Issue:** No attribute prerequisites or minimum requirements for capabilities

**Impact:** Any character can attempt any action with only minor penalty. This eliminates meaningful tradeoffs during character creation and reduces the value of party role differentiation.

**Location:** Attribute Ratings and What They Mean


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a competently designed fiction-first system that will serve tables prioritizing collaborative narrative construction over tactical challenge and world simulation. The writing is clear, the organization is logical, and the core resolution mechanic is mathematically sound.

For an OSR veteran who values concrete procedures, meaningful mechanical differentiation, and objective world simulation, the system falls short in predictable ways. The attribute spread is too flat, combat lacks tactical depth, skill scope is uncalibrated, and GM procedures are philosophical rather than procedural.

My specific concerns:

1. Character Differentiation: The 2/1/1/0 attribute spread creates characters who are roughly similar in capability across most situations. Tactical party composition—a cornerstone of OSR play—becomes less meaningful when everyone can attempt everything with minor penalties.

2. Combat Depth: Resolve Clocks are a clever abstraction, but without weapon stats, armor mechanics, positioning rules, or constrained action economy, combat becomes collaborative description rather than tactical problem-solving. The explicit rejection of initiative in favor of "conversational order" removes tactical timing decisions.

3. Skill Calibration: Open skill creation without scope rubrics invites table conflict and inconsistent rulings. The GM guidance to approve skills based on "clear scope" provides no actual calibration tools.

4. GM Procedures: The absence of encounter tables, reaction rolls, morale mechanics, and time-tracking procedures means the world responds based on GM interpretation rather than discoverable rules. Players experience the GM's creative decisions, not an objective world they can learn to navigate.

5. Tags and Clocks: These represent the strongest mechanical elements. The Tag vocabulary creates consistent environmental modifiers, and Clocks provide visible progress tracking. If the whole system had this level of procedural clarity, my assessment would be different.

The book knows what it is trying to be and succeeds at that goal. It is not designed for tables that want the GM to simulate an objective world using randomized procedures. It is designed for tables that want flexible tools for collaborative storytelling with some mechanical structure.

Final Assessment: 6.5/10 - Well-executed for its intended audience, but fundamentally misaligned with OSR-style tactical and simulationist play. I would consider a "Tactical Procedures" supplement that adds the missing mechanical depth, but the core philosophy would need significant optional overlays to work for my table.
