## Narrative Feedback

As Riley the Rules Lawyer, I approached this rulebook looking for what I always need: concrete numbers, consistent mechanics, and clear procedures I can rely on at the table.

**The Good:**

The core resolution mechanic is solid and well-defined. Roll 4d6, add Attribute (0-2), compare to DC (12-22 ladder), and interpret based on margin. The outcome tiers are mathematically clean:
- Critical Success: Margin >= +5
- Full Success: Margin >= 0
- Partial Success: Margin -1 to -2
- Failure: Margin <= -3
- Critical Failure: Margin <= -7 or all 1s

The Edge/Burden system is elegantly capped at +/-2, preventing runaway modifier stacking. The rule that Edge and Burden cancel each other (e.g., +2 and -1 = +1) is practical and easy to adjudicate.

The DC ladder (12 Easy, 14 Routine, 16 Tough, 18 Hard, 20 Heroic, 22 Legendary) gives clear benchmarks, though I would appreciate more guidance on when to use each level.

**Concerns:**

1. **Resolve Clocks instead of hit points.** While the philosophical justification is clear ("fiction first"), I found myself wanting more concrete guidance on how many segments to tick per outcome. The example mentions "Full Success on a Strike ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost" but this isn't presented as a formal rule, just an example. Is this the standard? Can it vary?

2. **Skills lack numeric bonuses.** The system repeatedly says Skills "apply" or are "relevant" but never explicitly states what mechanical benefit they provide. Do Skills grant +1? +2? Edge? This is my biggest frustration - I need to know the actual numbers.

3. **Attribute spread (2,1,1,0) plus 4d6** produces a narrow statistical band. With an average 4d6 roll of 14 and Attributes adding 0-2, most checks hit 14-16. Against a DC 16 "Tough" check, even a +2 Attribute character has roughly coin-flip odds. I appreciate tight math, but want this confirmed as intentional.

4. **Proficiencies** are described as granting Edge or lowering DCs "when appropriate" but never pinned down. One example says a Proficiency "lowers the effective DC and grants Edge." Which is it? Both? By how much?

5. **Combat turn structure** is loose. "One main action" plus "move as needed" plus "something small" is flavorful but imprecise. What counts as small? What limits movement?

**What I Need:**

A summary table showing:
- Skill: What bonus it grants
- Proficiency: Standard mechanical effect
- Condition severity levels: How much Burden each imposes
- Resolve Clock guidelines: Segments per attack tier

This rulebook trusts the GM and players to negotiate details in the moment. That's fine for some tables, but I prefer systems where I can calculate expected outcomes before I roll.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 14 - Skills System Overview

**Issue:** Skills are described as 'relevant' or 'applying' to checks but the specific mechanical bonus is never stated. Do Skills provide +1, +2, Edge, or something else?

**Impact:** Cannot calculate expected success rates or compare character builds without knowing skill bonuses

**Location:** Lines 3166-3312 in Skills System Overview

### 2. Chapter 16 - Proficiencies System Overview

**Issue:** Proficiencies are said to 'lower the effective DC' and/or 'grant Edge' but no standardized rule exists. Examples show different effects.

**Impact:** Inconsistent application at the table; arguments about what Proficiency actually does

**Location:** Chapter 16 and various examples throughout

### 3. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock segment advancement is shown in examples (2 for Full Success, 1 for Partial) but not codified as a rule. Movement and minor actions lack clear definitions.

**Impact:** Different GMs will run combat with different pacing; tactical planning is difficult without consistent damage expectations

**Location:** Lines 2568-2600, Resolve Instead of Hit Points section

### 4. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The margin-based outcome system is excellent, but no explicit guidance on how Conditions translate to Burden levels. Some Conditions impose Burden, some 'limit options' - but which is which?

**Impact:** Cannot pre-calculate penalty severity from Conditions like Exhausted vs. Bleeding vs. Frightened

**Location:** Lines 2284-2298, Edge/Burden section

### 5. Chapter 18 - Extended Tags and Conditions Reference

**Issue:** While many Tags and Conditions are listed, their mechanical effects are described qualitatively rather than quantitatively ('often imposes Burden' vs. 'imposes -1 Burden')

**Impact:** Table-to-table variation in how Tags affect rolls

**Location:** Chapter 18 throughout


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a mathematically sound core engine - 4d6 plus small modifiers against a DC ladder is tight and predictable. The five-tier outcome system (Critical Success through Critical Failure) based on margin is intuitive and creates meaningful gradation.

However, the rulebook prioritizes flexibility and fiction-first philosophy over mechanical precision in several key areas. Skills, Proficiencies, and Conditions are described in terms of what they represent in the narrative rather than what numbers they contribute. For a Tactician who needs concrete numbers to plan character builds and predict outcomes, this creates friction.

The Edge/Burden system is the most fully specified mechanic and works well. The DC ladder provides solid benchmarks. Combat's use of Resolve Clocks instead of hit points is philosophically interesting but mechanically underspecified.

**Rating Justification:**
- Clarity & Readability (8/10): Well-organized, examples are plentiful, prose is clear. Deducted points for buried or missing mechanical specifications.
- Rules Accuracy (7/10): Core mechanics are consistent. Deducted for ambiguity around Skills, Proficiencies, and Conditions. No outright contradictions found.
- Persona Fit (7/10): This system wants me to negotiate mechanics in the moment rather than calculate in advance. It can work for me, but requires more table-level calibration than I prefer.
- Practical Usability (6/10): At the table, I will frequently need to ask "what does this Skill/Proficiency/Condition actually do mechanically?" The GM guidance is good but transfers too much adjudication burden.

**Recommendation:** Include a "Mechanical Summary" appendix with a single table showing all bonuses, penalties, and standard effects. This would let analytical players like me prepare effectively while preserving the fiction-first philosophy in the main text.
