## Narrative Feedback

After running games across dozens of systems over two decades, I know when a rulebook is speaking my language. Razorweave does more than that - it articulates the intuitions I have developed through years of facilitation and makes them teachable.

The fiction-first philosophy here is not just rhetoric. It runs through every mechanical decision. The three-question test for when to call for a Check (uncertainty, consequence, agency) is precisely the heuristic I use instinctively, now written down in a way I can hand to new GMs at my table. Chapter 21's "ask first, then roll" guidance should be printed on every GM screen ever made.

What excites me most as someone who constantly integrates different systems is how elegantly the mechanical pieces interconnect. Attributes flow into Skills flow into Proficiencies. Tags and Conditions layer narrative weight onto those foundations. Clocks track momentum from personal injuries all the way up to world-scale events. Each subsystem references and reinforces the others without creating circular dependencies or complexity spirals. You can teach each piece independently, but mastery comes from seeing how they harmonize.

The DC ladder and outcome tiers are beautifully calibrated. I especially appreciate the explicit guidance about when Partial Success means "success with cost" versus "partial achievement." That distinction gives me the flexibility I need to match outcomes to the fiction moment by moment. The advice about using Tags to justify Edge or Burden rather than hunting for numeric modifiers keeps attention where it belongs - on the story.

Chapter 21 (Running Sessions) feels like it was written specifically for experienced GMs who want to refine their craft. The session agenda structure, the scene framing guidance with Tags and Clocks, the emphasis on ending sessions cleanly with Clock and Tag review - this is hard-won wisdom distilled into teachable principles. The three-question fallback ("What do NPCs want? What do players care about? What happens if no one acts?") is exactly the kind of procedural anchor that keeps scenes moving.

The genre flexibility is exactly what I need. I run different campaigns for different groups - sometimes cosmic horror, sometimes political intrigue, sometimes cozy community mysteries - and Razorweave's abstract framework adapts to all of them. The Tags system means I can model any environment, any social dynamic, any source of pressure without inventing new subsystems for each setting. That portability is invaluable.

The Proficiencies chapter crystallizes something I have always believed: expertise should be about narrative permission and domain knowledge, not just numeric bonuses. The guidance about treating Proficiencies as "permission first and bonus second" validates my approach to character competence.

Chapter 22 (Running Campaigns) provides exactly the arc-thinking framework I use to structure long-term play. The distinction between short, medium, and long arcs gives me vocabulary to discuss campaign scope with players. The between-session prep guidance ("advance fronts, choose anchors, update Tags") matches my workflow almost exactly.

If I have any concerns, they are minor refinements to an already excellent foundation. Some sections could use more worked examples showing complex multi-phase encounters in action. The advancement pacing guidance, while flexible, leaves newer GMs without concrete benchmarks for different campaign lengths. And the NPC-to-VPC promotion criteria could be more explicit for GMs who have not yet developed instincts about companion character management.

But these are polish notes, not structural issues. This is a system built by people who understand what experienced GMs actually do at the table.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Limited worked examples for complex tactical scenarios

**Impact:** The four-action framework (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) is clear for simple encounters, but scaling to multi-phase battles with environmental hazards, multiple enemy types, and shifting terrain requires significant GM extrapolation. A worked example showing a 3-4 round encounter with Clock advancement, Tag changes, and Condition cascades would help.

**Location:** Chapter 10, Putting It Together section

### 2. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long-Term Growth

**Issue:** Missing concrete pacing benchmarks for different campaign structures

**Impact:** A 10-session arc and a 50-session campaign need very different advancement cadences, but the chapter provides principles rather than specific recommendations. New GMs may struggle to calibrate how often advancement should occur. Even rough guidelines ('expect 1-2 Skill advances per arc') would help.

**Location:** Chapter 19, Milestones and Growth section

### 3. Chapter 24: NPCs, VPCs, and Enemies

**Issue:** Implicit rather than explicit NPC-to-VPC promotion criteria

**Impact:** When should a recurring helpful NPC be formalized as a VPC with their own Tags, Conditions, and spotlight time? The distinction matters for party dynamics and narrative focus, but the transition criteria are described implicitly through examples rather than stated as clear guidelines.

**Location:** Chapter 24, VPC Roles subsection

### 4. Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Duplicate 'Example' labels in example boxes

**Impact:** Minor presentation issue - example boxes display 'Example Example' pattern due to formatting inconsistency. Does not affect comprehension but creates visual noise that detracts from otherwise clean presentation.

**Location:** Multiple example boxes throughout Chapter 4

### 5. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Typo: 'Manege position' should be 'Manage position'

**Impact:** Minor typo in the Positioning and Environment section that does not impede understanding but should be corrected for professional polish.

**Location:** Positioning and Environment section, paragraph about Tags in combat


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is exceptional game design that speaks directly to experienced, genre-flexible, collaborative GMs. Its fiction-first philosophy is articulated with unusual clarity and backed by practical tools that actually work at the table.

For Forever GMs like me, this book offers both validation and education. The Running Sessions chapter crystallizes practices I have developed through years of trial and error into teachable principles. The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks system provides exactly the flexible narrative infrastructure I need to run multiple genres without learning new mechanical subsystems for each campaign.

The system's greatest strength is its elegant interconnection. Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks form a coherent framework where each piece supports the others. As someone who constantly analyzes how game systems work together, I find this architecture deeply satisfying. You can understand each component independently, but real fluency comes from seeing how they combine.

The issues I have noted are refinements, not fundamental problems. More worked combat examples, clearer advancement pacing, and explicit VPC promotion criteria would help newer GMs, but experienced Forever GMs will fill these gaps intuitively. The flexibility that creates these small ambiguities is also what makes the system so adaptable across genres and play styles.

I would enthusiastically recommend this book to:
- GMs who run multiple campaigns across different genres and want a portable system
- Tables that value collaborative storytelling and fiction-first play
- Experienced GMs looking for codified wisdom they can share with their players
- Anyone tired of systems that prioritize mechanical simulation over narrative momentum

This is not just a book I will read and appreciate - it is a system I will run for years to come. The GM chapters alone are worth the price of admission, and the mechanical framework is robust enough to carry any story I want to tell.

Final Rating: 9.25/10 - A thoughtful, well-designed system that immediately earns a permanent place in any Forever GM's toolkit.
