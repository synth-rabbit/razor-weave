## Narrative Feedback

As someone who thrives on tactical decision-making and visual information processing, my experience with the Razorweave Core Rulebook has been a mixed journey. I'm coming from more traditional fantasy TTRPGs and trying to convert my group to this cyberpunk-adjacent setting, so I was looking for clear mechanical frameworks and visual aids to help bridge that gap.

The synthwave aesthetic is immediately striking - the electric blue and hot pink color scheme creates strong visual hierarchy, and the use of Space Grotesk for headers makes scanning for information relatively intuitive. As a visual learner, I appreciate how the example boxes and GM guidance sections are distinctly colored and styled with those torn-paper edges. It helps me quickly locate different types of information during play.

However, as a tactician, I find myself wanting more structured decision trees and flowcharts for complex interactions. The rules are there, but they're embedded in prose rather than presented as clear procedural steps. When I'm mid-session and need to quickly adjudicate a contested action or layered effect, I have to read through paragraphs rather than following a visual diagram. The tables help somewhat, with their alternating row colors for readability, but tactical scenarios could benefit from more visual representations of mechanical relationships.

For converting players from other systems, the book provides reasonable onboarding, but the unique terminology requires significant front-loading. My group would benefit from a quick-reference sheet that visually maps Razorweave concepts to more familiar TTRPG paradigms. The character sheets included are functional, but as someone who thinks spatially, I'd love to see relationship maps or tactical position trackers integrated into the design.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Rules Resolution Flow

**Issue:** Complex rule interactions are explained narratively rather than visually mapped

**Impact:** As a tactician, I need to quickly parse decision points during play - narrative explanations slow down my adjudication process significantly

**Location:** Combat and conflict resolution sections

### 2. Visual Learning Support

**Issue:** Limited use of diagrams, flowcharts, or visual decision aids for mechanical procedures

**Impact:** My visual processing style means I absorb information faster from structured graphics than from text blocks - the current format requires more cognitive load

**Location:** Throughout rules chapters, particularly character creation and action resolution

### 3. System Conversion Context

**Issue:** No explicit comparison or conversion guidance for players coming from other TTRPG systems

**Impact:** As someone converting my group to this system, I have to create my own mental mappings between familiar concepts and Razorweave terminology

**Location:** Introduction and player-facing rules chapters

### 4. Quick Reference Accessibility

**Issue:** Reference sheets exist but are embedded in the document flow rather than being easily extractable one-page summaries

**Impact:** During play, I need instant access to frequently-used tables and rules - the current layout requires bookmarking or separate printouts

**Location:** Sheet blocks and reference materials sections

## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook demonstrates strong foundational design with its distinctive synthwave aesthetic and thoughtful information hierarchy. For a tactician with visual learning preferences who is converting from other systems, the book provides adequate clarity and rules accuracy but falls short on visual mechanical aids and conversion support. The responsive layout and print stylesheet show attention to usability, but the dense prose-based rule explanations create friction for quick reference during tactical play. I would recommend supplementary visual aids and conversion guides for players with similar backgrounds.
