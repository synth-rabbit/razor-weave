## Narrative Feedback

As an Explorer who moves fluidly between GM and player roles, I found the Razorweave Core Rulebook speaks directly to my sensibilities. The fiction-first approach isn't something I need to learn—it's native to how I've always approached games. What impresses me here is how the text articulates principles I've long felt intuitively.

The collaborative storytelling philosophy permeates every chapter. The game genuinely trusts everyone at the table to contribute meaningfully, which is exactly what I look for. The emphasis on "Play to Find Out" rather than predetermined outcomes creates the space for genuine discovery that makes sessions memorable.

My Systems Integrator brain appreciates how the mechanics interconnect. Clocks, Tags, Skills, and Proficiencies form a coherent ecosystem rather than isolated subsystems. The Resolution Ladder provides clear escalation paths while maintaining narrative flexibility. I can see how these pieces work together to create emergent complexity from simple building blocks.

However, my wariness of abstraction flared up in certain sections. The Clocks mechanic, while elegant, sometimes feels like it could become a meta-game tracker that distances players from the fiction. The book addresses this concern somewhat by emphasizing that Clocks should emerge from narrative stakes, but I'd appreciate more guidance on keeping them grounded. When is a Clock helping versus becoming a distraction?

Similarly, the tag economy—while powerful—occasionally veers toward the abstract. "Burning" tags for fictional permissions is clever, but in practice, I worry about players gaming the system rather than engaging with the story. The examples help, but more negative examples (what NOT to do) would strengthen the teaching.

The hybrid GM/Player perspective means I'm constantly evaluating: "Can I teach this to my table? Can I play in this as a PC?" On both counts, Razorweave mostly succeeds. The GM Guidance sections are genuinely helpful without being prescriptive. The player-facing rules are intuitive enough that someone new to fiction-first play could engage meaningfully.

What truly excites me is the exploration potential. The open-ended character creation, the emphasis on "Emergent Truth," and the collaborative world-building tools all support the kind of play where everyone is genuinely discovering together. This isn't a game where the GM has all the answers—it's a game where the answers emerge from play.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 4: Running the Game

**Issue:** Clock abstraction level needs calibration guidance

**Impact:** Hybrid GMs may struggle to maintain immersion when tracking multiple Clocks—guidance on when Clocks help vs. hinder narrative flow would strengthen the tool

**Location:** Clocks and Tracking Progress subsection

### 2. Core Mechanics: Tags

**Issue:** Tag 'burning' economy can feel gamey

**Impact:** Explorers seeking immersive discovery may find the mechanical negotiation of burning tags pulls them out of the fiction; needs more grounding examples

**Location:** Using and Burning Tags

### 3. Chapter 3: Character Creation

**Issue:** Open skill lists may overwhelm collaborative tables

**Impact:** Groups with multiple players who share narrative authority may struggle to calibrate appropriate skill granularity without more examples of good vs. problematic skill definitions

**Location:** Choosing Skills section

### 4. Chapter 5: Ways to Play

**Issue:** Exploration mode procedures underdeveloped

**Impact:** For Explorers, the procedures for discovery-focused play feel less robust than dramatic conflict procedures—more explicit tools for non-conflict exploration would enhance the experience

**Location:** Exploration and Discovery


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a thoughtful, well-crafted fiction-first system that earns high marks for its collaborative philosophy and systemic coherence. For Explorers like me who thrive on discovery and move between GM and player roles, it provides excellent scaffolding. The interconnected mechanics reward systems thinking while maintaining narrative primacy.

The book's greatest strength is its trust in players—it treats everyone at the table as a creative collaborator rather than an audience member or rules-follower. This philosophy enables the emergent, discovery-oriented play I cherish.

My concerns about abstraction are real but manageable. With a thoughtful table, the Clocks and Tags can remain grounded in fiction. The book would benefit from more guidance on keeping these tools tethered to narrative rather than becoming meta-game optimization targets.

I rate Razorweave an 8/10 for my playstyle. It's a system I'd enthusiastically run and happily play in. The slight reservation stems from wishing the exploration procedures matched the robustness of the conflict procedures—but that's a refinement rather than a flaw. This is a game designed for tables that want to discover stories together, and it delivers on that promise.
