## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been spinning tales at the table for over a decade, I approached the Razorweave Core Rulebook with the hopeful curiosity of a storyteller seeking new tools. The book makes a strong first impression - it clearly wants to support fiction-first play, which resonates with my narrative sensibilities.

The structure is thoughtfully laid out. Starting with "Welcome to the Game" and building through "Core Concepts at a Glance" before diving into rules respects how I learn. I appreciate being told what I need to know at each stage rather than front-loading everything. The book's layered learning approach - read what's relevant, return when needed - matches how I actually use rulebooks in practice.

What draws me in is the emphasis on fiction-first mechanics. The "Fiction First, Mechanics Second" principle speaks directly to my storytelling heart. When the book says characters exist as "complete fictional people," not just stat blocks, I feel seen. This is the kind of system that wants the story to matter.

However, my quest for simplicity hit some bumps. While the core loop seems elegant enough, the book introduces Tags, Conditions, Clocks, Skills, Proficiencies - layers upon layers of mechanical abstraction. For someone seeking streamlined play, this feels like weight I'd need to carry. I found myself wondering: could I run this with just the essentials? The book hints at flexibility, but doesn't clearly delineate a minimal viable ruleset.

As a non-GM player, I was intrigued by Chapter 5's mention of different play modes including GMless cooperative play. But the book's heart seems firmly with the traditional GM role. The player-facing guidance in Chapter 13 helps, yet I wished for more concrete tools for distributed authority or rotating GM responsibilities.

The Skills and Proficiencies chapters are comprehensive - perhaps too comprehensive for my taste. Open lists are praised as features, but as someone who prefers boundaries over infinite possibility, I'd appreciate curated defaults with optional expansion rather than complete freedom from the start.

The writing itself is clear and engaging. The synthwave aesthetic suggested by the visual design feels fresh, though I can only imagine it from the HTML structure. The torn-paper callout boxes for examples and GM notes seem like clever visual devices to separate narrative guidance from mechanical instruction.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Concepts and System Overview

**Issue:** Mechanical complexity may overwhelm simplicity-seekers

**Impact:** Players wanting streamlined fiction-first play face significant system weight before they can start storytelling

**Location:** Chapters 6-9: Character Creation through Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

### 2. Chapter 5: Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** GMless and distributed authority modes underdeveloped

**Impact:** Non-GM players lack concrete procedures for running without a dedicated Game Master, limiting play options

**Location:** GMless Cooperative Play subsection

### 3. Skills and Proficiencies System

**Issue:** Open lists create decision paralysis for some players

**Impact:** Curious exploration becomes overwhelming without curated starting points or recommended minimal sets

**Location:** Chapters 14-17: Skills and Proficiencies References

### 4. Character Creation

**Issue:** No quick-start or simplified character option

**Impact:** Veteran storytellers who want to jump into narrative quickly must still engage with full mechanical character building

**Location:** Chapter 6: Character Creation


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a compelling vision for fiction-first tabletop roleplay, and its core philosophy aligns beautifully with storyteller values. The book is well-written, logically structured, and clearly passionate about putting narrative before numbers. However, for players seeking simplicity, the system carries more mechanical weight than its fiction-first aspirations might suggest. The comprehensive Skills and Proficiencies systems, while flexible, may feel like overhead rather than enablement for those who want to focus on the story. Non-GM players will find acknowledgment of their play style but may wish for more developed support. I'd rate this 7/10 for my needs - a strong foundation that could become a go-to system with clearer pathways to minimal-complexity play.
