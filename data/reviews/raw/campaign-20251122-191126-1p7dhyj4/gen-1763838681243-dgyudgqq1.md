## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been running games for many years and takes an analytical approach to system mastery, I find the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a well-crafted piece of game design. I approached this with genuine curiosity about how fiction-first systems work, and I came away with a solid understanding of the core concepts.

The layered learning approach is excellent. Chapter 2 explicitly tells you that you can learn in stages rather than absorbing everything at once - this respects the GM's time and reduces the cognitive load of onboarding. The book is very clear about what each chapter covers and how they interconnect.

From an analytical standpoint, I appreciate how the mechanics are explained with precision. The Fortune Die system at 2d6+2 with the three-tier outcome structure (10+, 7-9, 6-) is elegant and easy to internalize. The Stress/Harm dichotomy is well-defined, and the progression from one tier to another has clear mechanical consequences.

However, I do have concerns about running this as a Railroad Conductor style GM. My preferred approach involves pre-planning story beats and guiding players toward specific narrative destinations. The "Fiction First, Mechanics Second" principle and the heavy emphasis on player agency creates tension with that style. The book repeatedly emphasizes responding to player choices rather than directing them toward predetermined outcomes.

The Clocks system is something I'm genuinely curious about - it seems like a powerful tool for pacing dramatic tension, but I'd like more guidance on how to use them to steer scenes rather than just track abstract progress. The section on Clocks explains what they are but not how a GM who wants tighter narrative control should deploy them.

I'm comfortable with the abstraction levels here - Skills as narrative permissions rather than numerical bonuses, Tags as fictional positioning markers. These make sense to me conceptually, though I wonder how players less comfortable with abstraction would handle the open-ended nature of character creation.

The cross-referencing is strong. Terms are defined in context, and the Glossary in Chapter 28 serves as a reliable reference. The structure supports the analytical reader who wants to understand how all the pieces fit together.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 1: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy conflicts with structured GMing styles

**Impact:** GMs who prefer to plan story beats in advance will struggle to reconcile the 'play to find out' philosophy with their preferred Railroad Conductor approach

**Location:** Fiction First, Mechanics Second and The Conversation subsections

### 2. Chapter 6: GM Principles and Agenda

**Issue:** GM guidance assumes responsive rather than directive play

**Impact:** The principles focus on following player leads rather than steering - this leaves analytical GMs who want to plan ahead without clear procedures for their style

**Location:** Be a Fan of the Characters and Play to Find Out What Happens

### 3. Chapter 9: Clocks

**Issue:** Clock mechanics lack directive GM usage guidance

**Impact:** While Clocks are explained well mechanically, there's no guidance on using them proactively to pace pre-planned story beats rather than reactively tracking emergent situations

**Location:** When to Create Clocks and Advancing Clocks subsections

### 4. Chapter 3: Character Creation

**Issue:** Open-ended Skills list may challenge achievement-oriented players

**Impact:** Achiever players who want clear goals and measurable progress may find the 'create whatever Skills you want' approach frustrating without clearer benchmarks for what makes a well-built character

**Location:** Skills and Proficiencies sections


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a technically proficient and well-organized game text. It excels at explaining its mechanical systems with precision and provides excellent support for analytical readers who want to understand how everything interconnects. The layered learning approach respects the GM's time, and the cross-referencing is thorough.

However, the book assumes a particular GMing philosophy that prioritizes emergence over planning. For GMs like myself who prefer a Railroad Conductor approach - pre-planning story beats and guiding players toward specific dramatic moments - the fiction-first philosophy creates friction rather than synergy. The book would benefit from a section explicitly addressing how structured GMs can adapt these principles to their preferred style.

That said, my curiosity about fiction-first systems has been satisfied. I now understand what these games are trying to accomplish and have the tools to at least experiment with the approach. I rate this an 8 out of 10 overall - excellent execution of its design goals, but with a philosophy mismatch for my preferred GMing style that prevents full endorsement for my use case.
