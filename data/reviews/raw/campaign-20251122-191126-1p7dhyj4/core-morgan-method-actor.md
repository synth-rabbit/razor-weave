## Narrative Feedback

As someone who lives inside characters--who breathes their fears, feels their weight, and sees through their eyes--I found the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a remarkably sympathetic companion for the kind of deep character work I crave.

The fiction-first philosophy resonates with how I actually play. The text understands that mechanics should serve the story, not interrupt it. When I'm in the middle of a tense scene, fully inhabiting my character's mounting desperation, the last thing I want is to be yanked out by arbitrary rules-lawyering. This book gets that. The emphasis on "intent and approach" mirrors my own process: I already know what my character wants and how they'd go about it before I ever touch dice.

The character creation chapter feels less like filling out a form and more like discovering a person. Starting with concept before mechanics? That's exactly right. I don't build characters from stats up--I find them, then figure out what numbers might represent what I've already sensed about them. The identity elements section encourages exactly this kind of organic discovery.

What I particularly appreciate is how the system handles failure. Failure as "momentum" rather than a dead end? Yes. Every setback my character faces is another layer of their story, another wound that shapes who they're becoming. The partial success mechanic gives me room to find those complicated, messy moments where my character achieves something but pays a cost--that's where the real drama lives.

The chapter on core principles of play reads almost like a manifesto for character-centered play. "Respect for Player Ownership" acknowledges that my character is mine to inhabit. The GM describes the world; I decide how my character engages with it. That trust is essential.

However, I noticed some areas where the book could serve method actors better. The Skills and Proficiencies sections, while appropriately open-ended, sometimes feel like they're missing the emotional vocabulary. I want to know how my character's "Stealth" feels to them--is it predatory, protective, or paranoid? The mechanics are clean but occasionally sterile.

The advancement section could use more guidance on how character growth emerges from story moments rather than session counts. When my character changes, it's because they've lived through something that altered them fundamentally--not because we hit a milestone.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Skills lack emotional context

**Impact:** Method actors may struggle to connect mechanical competencies to character psychology. The Skills section focuses on what characters can do but not how they feel about these abilities.

**Location:** Step Four: Choose Skills

### 2. Chapter 14-17: Skills & Proficiencies Reference

**Issue:** Reference sections are mechanically focused

**Impact:** While comprehensive, the reference sections read like a toolkit rather than a character guide. Adding brief narrative hooks to each entry would help actors embody their choices more fully.

**Location:** Skills and Proficiencies chapters

### 3. Chapter 20: Advancement and Growth

**Issue:** Advancement feels milestone-based rather than story-driven

**Impact:** The advancement system could better acknowledge that character transformation often comes from singular powerful moments rather than accumulated experience. Method actors need to see their characters evolve through narrative beats.

**Location:** Advancement mechanics

### 4. Chapter 7: Core Resolution

**Issue:** Dice mechanics could interrupt character immersion

**Impact:** While the intent/approach framework is excellent, the transition from fiction to dice and back could be smoother. Some guidance on maintaining character voice during mechanical resolution would help actors stay in character.

**Location:** Check resolution procedure


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is one of the more method-actor-friendly systems I've encountered. Its fiction-first philosophy isn't just lip service--it's woven through every chapter. The emphasis on starting with story, discovering characters organically, and treating failure as transformation rather than punishment demonstrates a genuine understanding of character-centered play.

For experienced players who lose themselves in their characters, this system provides the structure we need without the constraints that would break our immersion. The open-ended Skills and Proficiencies system means I'm never forced to fit my character into a pre-defined box. The collaborative table philosophy respects player ownership while maintaining clear boundaries between player and GM authority.

My criticisms are refinements rather than fundamental issues. The book could lean further into the emotional and psychological dimensions of character abilities. It could make advancement feel more organically tied to story transformation. But these are wishes for the next edition, not deal-breakers.

If you're the kind of player who prepares for sessions by writing journal entries in your character's voice, who feels genuine emotion when your character suffers or triumphs, who thinks about your character's childhood and fears and secret hopes even when they're not mechanically relevant--this book will welcome you. It won't get in your way. And sometimes, that's exactly what we need.

Rating: Strong recommendation for fiction-first and character-focused players. The system respects the craft of inhabiting another person.
