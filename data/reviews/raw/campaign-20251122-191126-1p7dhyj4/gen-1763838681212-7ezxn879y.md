## Narrative Feedback

As a newcomer to tabletop RPGs who gravitates toward tactical thinking but wants to embrace narrative-first play, I found this rulebook to be ambitious and visually striking, but challenging to navigate.

**What Works Well:**
The worldbuilding is immersive and evocative. The synthwave cyberpunk setting immediately draws you in with its neon-soaked megacities and corporate dystopia. I appreciate how the book weaves narrative throughout the mechanical content - the faction histories, the Cyberpsychosis progression, and the reputation system all tell stories, not just provide numbers.

The 2d6 core mechanic with Outcome Levels is elegant and easy to grasp. I like how a single roll tells you both success/failure AND degree of success. The Stress and Willpower system creates natural narrative beats without me having to think too hard about when drama should happen.

**Where I Struggled:**
As a newbie, I found myself lost in the sheer volume of interconnected systems. The book introduces Crew mechanics, Reputation with multiple factions, Cyberware, Drones, NET operations, and vehicle combat - each with their own subsystems. As a Systems Integrator, I WANT to understand how these all connect, but the book doesn't provide a clear roadmap showing dependencies between systems.

The chapter organization feels optimized for reference rather than learning. I wanted a "your first session" or "quick start" pathway that would let me experience the game's narrative strengths without mastering every subsystem first.

**Tactical vs Narrative Tension:**
The tactical depth is there - combat modifiers, range bands, cover mechanics, cyberware bonuses - but as someone converting to fiction-first play, I'm not sure when to invoke these mechanics versus when to let the narrative carry the scene. The GM Guidance sections help, but I'm a player (Non-GM), so I need player-facing advice on this.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter Structure / Onboarding

**Issue:** No clear 'first session' or progressive learning pathway for new players

**Impact:** Newbies must absorb entire system before feeling confident to play; high barrier to entry for someone with 0-1 years experience

**Location:** Table of Contents / Book-wide structure

### 2. Core Mechanics Introduction

**Issue:** The core dice mechanic is explained well, but subsystems are introduced without clear hierarchy

**Impact:** As a Systems Integrator, I wanted a visual diagram showing how Stress connects to Conditions, how Reputation affects Resources, etc.

**Location:** Chapters 4-6 (Core Mechanics, Checks, Stress)

### 3. Player vs GM Guidance Split

**Issue:** Most narrative guidance is in GM-focused sections, leaving players uncertain about their narrative agency

**Impact:** As a Non-GM Narrative Purist, I need explicit permission and examples of player-driven narration within the mechanics

**Location:** GM Guidance callout boxes throughout

### 4. Tactical/Narrative Mode Switching

**Issue:** Unclear when to zoom into tactical detail vs. resolve narratively

**Impact:** For someone converting to fiction-first play, I need clearer signals about when mechanics serve the story vs. when story should override mechanics

**Location:** Combat, Hacking, Vehicle chapters

### 5. Character Creation Chapter

**Issue:** Many options presented without guidance on which choices matter most for different playstyles

**Impact:** A tactician wants to know optimal builds; a narrative purist wants to know which choices create interesting story hooks. Neither perspective is explicitly addressed.

**Location:** Chapter 3: Character Creation


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a lovingly crafted, comprehensive cyberpunk RPG that excels at worldbuilding and mechanical depth. However, for a newbie tactician who's converting to narrative-first play, it presents significant accessibility challenges.

**Strengths:** Evocative setting, elegant core dice mechanic, interconnected systems that reward deep engagement, beautiful aesthetic design.

**Challenges:** Steep learning curve, lack of progressive onboarding, minimal player-facing narrative guidance, unclear when to zoom into tactical detail.

**Recommendation:** I would still recommend this game to my gaming group, but I'd need an experienced GM or community resources to guide my first few sessions. A "Starter Scenario" or "Session Zero Guide" would dramatically improve accessibility for players like me.

**Rating Summary:** 5.75/10 average - The game has tremendous potential but needs better scaffolding for newcomers, especially those navigating the tactical-to-narrative transition.
