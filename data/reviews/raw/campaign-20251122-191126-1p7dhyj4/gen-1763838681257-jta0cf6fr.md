## Narrative Feedback

As a Method Actor who immerses deeply in character, I find Razorweave's fiction-first philosophy genuinely aligned with my playstyle. The emphasis on "Fiction First, Mechanics Second" resonates strongly - the text explicitly states that "Mechanics never replace the shared imagination of the table" and only calls for Checks when outcomes are meaningfully uncertain. This supports the kind of uninterrupted character immersion I crave.

However, as a Genre-Specific Purist, I struggle with the system's deliberate genre agnosticism. The book states it "does not assume one standard format" and supports everything from solo to GMless play. While flexible, this leaves me wanting more specific guidance for embodying characters within a particular genre's conventions. The telegraph engineer example is evocative, but I need deeper genre scaffolding to truly inhabit a character.

As a Systems Integrator, I appreciate how the mechanical pieces interconnect: Attributes flow into Skills, which connect to Proficiencies, all governed by the core Check resolution. The four-attribute system (Might, Agility, Presence, Reason) is elegantly minimal and the skill/proficiency distinction is logical - Skills for action, Proficiencies for expertise that shapes fiction. The pieces fit together coherently.

My Forever GM experience notes that while the GM guidance is philosophically solid ("Honesty does not mean revealing every detail"), it lacks concrete tools for the deep character moments Method Actors seek. The partial success and failure mechanics are well-explained as story beats, but I would benefit from more structured techniques for portraying NPCs as fully realized characters rather than just world elements.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Character Creation

**Issue:** Limited guidance for deep character embodiment beyond mechanical construction

**Impact:** Method Actors seeking immersion techniques must develop their own frameworks for inhabiting characters beyond the step-by-step creation process

**Location:** Chapter 6: Character Creation - Steps 1-2 cover concept and identity elements briefly but lack depth exercises

### 2. Genre Implementation

**Issue:** Deliberately genre-agnostic approach conflicts with Genre-Specific Purist expectations

**Impact:** The system's flexibility ('multiple styles of play', 'many different genres') means purists seeking focused genre conventions will need supplemental material

**Location:** Chapter 5: Ways to Play - explicitly embraces mode-switching without genre commitment

### 3. GM Guidance Philosophy

**Issue:** GM principles focus on world honesty rather than character depth portrayal

**Impact:** Forever GMs who want to method-act NPCs will find principles like 'present danger when danger exists' too focused on situation rather than character psychology

**Location:** Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play - GM Insight boxes throughout


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave Core Rulebook is a competent fiction-first system that successfully prioritizes narrative over mechanical crunch. Its philosophical alignment with fiction-first play is genuine and well-articulated. The interconnected systems (Attributes -> Skills -> Proficiencies -> Checks) are logically designed and should be learnable for Systems Integrators.

However, for a Method Actor / Genre-Specific Purist combination, the book presents a fundamental tension: it offers the freedom I need for character immersion but withholds the genre-specific scaffolding I need to know what kind of character I'm becoming. The character creation process is mechanically complete but lacks the deep identity exploration tools that would help me truly inhabit a character rather than just construct one.

Recommended with reservations: Excellent for fiction-first groups willing to develop their own genre conventions and character immersion practices. Less suitable for Method Actors seeking structured character embodiment techniques or Genre Purists wanting focused setting support out of the box.
