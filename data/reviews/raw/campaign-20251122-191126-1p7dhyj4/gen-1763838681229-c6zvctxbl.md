## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has spent over a decade crafting stories at the gaming table, I found Razorweave to be a refreshingly ambitious attempt at fusing cyberpunk aesthetics with tabletop mechanics. The synthwave visual language is immediately striking - those electric blues and hot pinks evoke the neon-soaked dystopias I love to explore in my games.

What draws me in most is the conceptual framework. The system appears to embrace narrative momentum while providing concrete mechanical anchors. As someone who thinks in abstract patterns but needs solid numbers to communicate with my players, this balance feels intentional and welcome.

The organizational structure is thoughtful. The table of contents reveals a logical progression from core concepts through character creation, gameplay mechanics, and GM resources. This architectural clarity helps me mentally map where different pieces of the system live.

However, I noticed the content I reviewed is primarily the HTML/CSS template and styling framework rather than the complete game content. The mechanical bones are visible through the stylistic flesh - I can see the scaffolding for examples, GM guidance boxes, and reference sheets - but many sections appear to be structural placeholders awaiting their full rulebook text.

The Sheet Block system for character sheets is elegantly designed with print-first thinking, which my veteran sensibilities appreciate. Too many modern games neglect the tactile experience of physical play.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Content Completeness

**Issue:** The reviewed content appears to be primarily a design template with styling and structure, rather than the complete rulebook text. Many sections reference chapters (ch-1 through ch-29) but the actual game content within those chapters is not fully present in what I reviewed.

**Impact:** As a storyteller, I need to understand the narrative frameworks, setting details, and mechanical interactions to evaluate how well this game would support my collaborative storytelling approach. The template structure is promising, but I cannot fully assess the system's storytelling potential without the complete content.

**Location:** Throughout the document - chapters referenced in table of contents and CSS selectors

### 2. Glossary and Index Structure

**Issue:** The CSS indicates glossary (#ch-28-glossary) and index (#ch-29-index) sections with sophisticated two-column print layouts, but the actual terminology and index entries are not visible in the content provided.

**Impact:** For a veteran player like myself, a robust glossary is essential for quickly resolving rule disputes and maintaining narrative flow. Abstract thinkers like me often connect concepts across distant parts of a rulebook, so a comprehensive index is invaluable.

**Location:** Sections ch-28-glossary and ch-29-index referenced in print stylesheet

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness vs Table Play

**Issue:** While the responsive design is technically impressive with breakpoints at 320px, 640px, 1024px, and 1440px, the focus on screen responsiveness may not address the primary use case: physical books and printed reference sheets at the gaming table.

**Impact:** As someone who values both digital reference and physical play, I appreciate the attention to print stylesheets, but wonder if the digital-first approach may have consumed design energy that could have enhanced the print reading experience further.

**Location:** Responsive layout section in CSS, @media queries

### 4. Example and GM Guidance Visual Distinction

**Issue:** While the torn-paper clip-path effect on .example and .gm boxes is visually distinctive, the asymmetric polygon variations may render inconsistently across browsers and could be lost entirely in print despite the stated print stylesheet accommodations.

**Impact:** For my curious, exploratory playstyle, I rely heavily on examples to understand how abstract rules manifest in concrete play. Visual distinction between examples and GM guidance helps me quickly locate the information I need during session prep.

**Location:** .example and .gm CSS classes with clip-path polygons

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents an ambitious and visually striking foundation for a cyberpunk TTRPG. The design system demonstrates sophisticated understanding of both digital and print media, with particular attention to accessibility features like skip links, focus indicators, and reduced motion preferences. The synthwave color palette creates immediate genre recognition.

As a veteran storyteller and abstract thinker, I find the conceptual architecture promising. The separation of concerns between example content, GM guidance, and reference sheets suggests a system designed to support multiple modes of engagement. The character sheet framework appears thoughtfully designed for actual table use.

However, this review is necessarily limited by the content provided - primarily the design template and CSS framework rather than the complete game text. The true test of any TTRPG for a storyteller lies in its narrative mechanics, setting depth, and the creative space it opens for collaborative fiction. Those elements require the full rulebook content to properly evaluate.

**Provisional Rating: 7.5/10** - Promising foundation with excellent visual design and structural organization, pending review of complete game content.
