## Narrative Feedback

As an Explorer with a Prepared Sandbox philosophy, this system speaks to me. The fiction-first approach is native to how I think about games, and as a Narrative Purist, I appreciate that mechanics serve the story rather than dictating it. My abstract thinking style meshes well with the conceptual frameworks presented. The neutral genre flexibility means I can adapt it to whatever worlds I want to explore. As a Forever GM running sandboxes, the tools for emergent play are valuable, though I'd love more prep-light sandbox generation tools.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Sandbox Tools

**Issue:** Limited dedicated sandbox preparation tools

**Impact:** Prepared Sandbox GMs may need to develop their own prep frameworks

**Location:** GM tools and preparation guidance

### 2. Emergent Play

**Issue:** Could provide more guidance on facilitating emergent narratives

**Impact:** Explorer GMs seeking player-driven discovery may want more support

**Location:** Campaign and session structure


## Overall Assessment

An excellent fit for narrative-focused Explorers who think abstractly. The fiction-first philosophy aligns perfectly with Narrative Purist values. Prepared Sandbox GMs will find a solid foundation, though supplementary sandbox tools would enhance the experience.
