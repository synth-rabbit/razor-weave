## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been playing TTRPGs for about seven years now, mainly as a Socializer who loves the collaborative storytelling and group dynamics, I approached Razorweave with cautious optimism. I'm actively trying to convert to fiction-first gaming after years of crunchier systems, but my instinct is still to look for concrete numbers to anchor my decisions. Here's what I found.

**The Social Experience Promise:**
Razorweave clearly understands that RPGs are fundamentally social experiences. The emphasis on collaborative worldbuilding, the way the Action Roll creates shared moments of tension, and the table-level agreements about tone and content all speak to someone who designed this with social play in mind. For a Socializer like me, that's immediately appealing.

**The Conversion Challenge - Where Are My Numbers?:**
Here's where my cautious nature and need for concrete numbers creates friction with the text. The book repeatedly asks me to make judgments like determining Position (Controlled/Risky/Desperate) and Effect (Limited/Standard/Great) based on "the fiction." But what does that actually mean in practice? When my character tries to charm the corporate executive, how do I know if that's Risky or Controlled?

The book provides examples, but I found myself wanting a decision matrix or flowchart. Something that says "If X conditions exist, then Position is Y." Instead, I'm asked to develop judgment through play - which feels scary when I'm trying to make this conversion work for my table.

**World Simulation Concerns:**
As someone who GMs with a World Simulator philosophy, I appreciate that Razorweave gives NPCs motivations, factions have goals, and the world responds to player actions through Progress Clocks. The faction system is particularly well-designed for this - it gives me tools to model how organizations pursue their interests.

However, the "play to find out what happens" philosophy creates tension with my instinct to model a coherent world. If I don't know what's in the next room until the fiction demands it, how do I maintain internal consistency? The book's answer seems to be "trust the process" - but for a cautious GM making this transition, that's a big ask.

**What Works for Social Play:**
The Flashback mechanic is brilliant for social groups. It prevents the analysis paralysis that can kill momentum in heist-style scenarios, and it rewards players for creative retroactive planning. The Contact and Ally systems give mechanical weight to relationship-building, which is exactly what a Socializer wants to see.

The downtime activities also support social play well - the interactions with factions, the training and projects, the vice system. These all create opportunities for character moments and relationship development between high-stakes scores.

**The Numbers I Need But Don't Have:**
What I desperately wanted and couldn't find:
1. A Position/Effect lookup table based on common fiction scenarios
2. Clear numerical guidance on clock sizes (why 4, 6, or 8?)
3. Concrete examples of dice pool construction for social encounters
4. Probability breakdowns for the dice system so I can explain outcomes to my players

**Conversion Roadmap Missing:**
For someone actively converting from traditional RPGs, I needed a section that says "If you're used to doing X in traditional games, here's how to approach that in Razorweave." Instead, the book assumes I've already internalized the fiction-first philosophy.

**Social Safety and Table Culture:**
The sections on lines and veils, safety tools, and session zero are excellent. These are exactly what a Socializer needs to ensure everyone at the table feels included and safe. The emphasis on consent and collaborative tone-setting is well-handled.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Action Resolution

**Issue:** Position/Effect determination lacks concrete decision aids for cautious GMs new to fiction-first

**Impact:** High - This is the core mechanic and I need more than 'read the fiction' to feel confident using it at my table

**Location:** Chapter 5 - Action Resolution and Consequence sections

### 2. Progress Clocks

**Issue:** Clock sizing guidelines are abstract rather than numerical

**Impact:** Medium-High - I need to know WHY a clock should be 4 vs 6 vs 8 segments, not just that it depends on complexity

**Location:** Clock mechanics throughout the book

### 3. Social Encounters

**Issue:** Limited examples of applying the action system to social/interpersonal situations

**Impact:** Medium - As a Socializer, many of my meaningful moments are character interactions, and I need more guidance here

**Location:** Character interaction examples scattered throughout

### 4. World Simulation

**Issue:** Tension between 'play to find out' philosophy and maintaining coherent world state

**Impact:** Medium - World Simulator GMs need guidance on balancing improvisation with consistency

**Location:** GM Principles section

### 5. Conversion Guidance

**Issue:** No explicit transition path for GMs converting from traditional prep-heavy systems

**Impact:** Medium - The book assumes buy-in rather than helping readers achieve it

**Location:** Throughout - should be a dedicated section


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a thoughtfully designed fiction-first TTRPG that clearly understands the social nature of tabletop gaming. For an experienced Socializer like myself, the emphasis on collaborative play, relationship mechanics, and group dynamics is appealing.

However, as someone cautiously converting from crunchier systems and who needs concrete numbers to feel anchored, the book presents significant transition challenges. The core mechanics (Position/Effect, Progress Clocks) rely heavily on developing intuition through play, which feels risky when trying to bring my table along on this conversion journey.

**What Works:**
- Strong social play support through Contacts, Allies, and faction systems
- Flashback mechanic that prevents analysis paralysis
- Excellent safety tools and table culture guidance
- Downtime system that creates space for character moments
- Dice system produces dramatic, readable results

**What's Missing:**
- Concrete decision aids for Position/Effect determination
- Numerical guidelines for clock sizing
- Explicit conversion guidance for traditional RPG players
- More social encounter examples with dice pool construction
- Probability breakdowns for player education

**Final Verdict:**
This is a 6.5/10 book for my specific combination of traits. The system is sound and the design philosophy is appealing, but the execution assumes a reader who has already made the fiction-first leap. For a cautious Socializer who needs concrete numbers as training wheels during the conversion process, Razorweave could be more supportive. I will likely use this system, but I'll need to develop supplementary reference materials to feel confident running it.

The book would benefit significantly from a "Conversion Guide" appendix that provides the concrete anchors that cautious converts like myself need while developing the intuition the system ultimately wants us to have.
