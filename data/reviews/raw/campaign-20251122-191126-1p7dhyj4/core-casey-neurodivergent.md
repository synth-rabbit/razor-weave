## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so I spent a lot of time with this rulebook, and I need to share what I noticed because some of this is really clever and some of it made me want to reorganize the whole thing myself.

First, the patterns. I love patterns. And Razorweave has them, which is great. The 4d6 system with the five outcome tiers follows a clear logic: Critical Success at +5 margin, Full Success at 0, Partial at -1 to -2, Failure at -3 or worse, Critical Failure at -7 or all 1s. I wrote this down on an index card and kept it next to me while reading. Having concrete numbers that stay consistent throughout the book is exactly what I need. When the rules reference "Partial Success" in Chapter 17 talking about Proficiencies, I know exactly what that means mechanically because Chapter 8 laid it out clearly.

The DC ladder is another good pattern: 12-14-16-18-20-22, each step is +2. Easy to remember, easy to internalize. I can hold this in my head during play without checking the book constantly.

Edge and Burden as "roll more dice, keep best/worst 4" is elegant. The cap at plus or minus 2 prevents the mental math from spiraling. I actually tested this with physical dice a few times to make sure I understood it, and it clicks once you do it. The way Edge and Burden cancel out (like +2 and -1 becomes +1) makes logical sense.

The Clocks system has clear rules too. I particularly appreciate that Clocks have defined segment counts (4, 6, or 8) with guidance on when to use each size. That predictability helps me anticipate pacing rather than feeling like everything is arbitrary.

What works less well for me is when the book gets abstract about when to apply things. The Proficiencies chapter (16 and 17) has beautiful tables with clear examples, but the actual rules for "when does a Proficiency apply" require negotiation with the GM. As someone who prefers clear patterns, I would rather have explicit triggers. The book says things like "when your background is relevant" but relevant is a judgment call that can feel inconsistent from moment to moment.

Same issue with Tags. Chapter 18 is a great reference, but Tags are described as "reminders that certain details should matter" rather than explicit mechanical triggers. I get why fiction-first design does this, but my brain wants a flowchart. If [tag] then [mechanical effect]. The book provides examples, which helps, but I had to read several examples before I could generalize the pattern.

I actually really like the examples in this book. They are concrete, they show the dice, they show outcomes at different tiers. The cross-genre examples are particularly helpful because they demonstrate that the same mechanic works the same way in different fictional contexts. Pattern recognition across settings proves the system is internally consistent.

The structure of the book itself has logic. Chapters 1-5 are orientation. 6-13 are player-facing rules. 14-18 are reference material. 19 is advancement. 20 is options. 21-26 are GM material. 27 is sheets and aids. I mapped this out while reading and it helped me know where to look for things. The table of contents sidebar is useful for navigation.

Some things that would help me specifically:

The outcome tier table should be printed on the character sheet or as a separate quick reference card. Having to flip back to Chapter 8 during play breaks my focus.

The Proficiency tables in Chapter 17 are excellent reference material, but they are buried in a chapter that mixes them with explanatory text. A consolidated Proficiency-only appendix would let me see all the patterns at once.

The Tags and Conditions in Chapter 18 start to feel overwhelming because there are so many and they are organized by category rather than by mechanical effect. I would find an alphabetical index with one-line summaries more scannable.

For character creation, I actually liked that Skills and Proficiencies are discussed as customizable rather than picked from a mandatory list. But I needed to read the example characters in multiple chapters before I understood the intended scope. More example characters with explicit annotations about why they chose what they chose would help pattern-match faster.

The Clocks chapter is good but I wanted more explicit guidance on when the GM should tick a threat clock versus when not to. "Failures and partials may tick related threat clocks" is guidance, but how do I know which clocks in a scene with three active clocks? This felt fuzzy in a system that otherwise provides clear procedures.

What I really appreciate: this system rewards paying attention to details. Tags that grant Edge are findable in the fiction if you listen for them. Proficiencies that apply come from character backstory that you established. The pattern is: invest in fictional setup, get mechanical payoff. Once I understood that pattern, the whole system made more sense.

Combat basics in Chapter 10 follow the same resolution system as everything else, which is good. No separate subsystem to learn. Position and effect tie back to Tags and Clocks. The pattern holds.

Overall, I can work with this system. The core loop is consistent and learnable. The places where it relies on GM judgment will require me to ask clarifying questions more often than in some other games, but the framework is solid enough that those conversations should be productive rather than arbitrary.

I would want my GM to be patient with me asking "okay but specifically, does this count?" especially at first. If they are willing to work through examples with me, I think the patterns will become clearer through play. The book gives us a shared vocabulary even if the application sometimes requires case-by-case discussion.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The outcome tier table (Critical Success, Full Success, etc.) is critical reference material but is only presented inline in explanatory text. No dedicated quick-reference format is provided in the chapter.

**Impact:** During play, I need to flip back to this chapter repeatedly. A scannable one-page reference would reduce cognitive load and speed up resolution.

**Location:** Chapter 8: Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin subsection

### 2. Chapter 16-17: Proficiencies

**Issue:** The criteria for when a Proficiency applies relies on judgment ('when your background is relevant') rather than explicit mechanical triggers. This creates ambiguity for players who prefer clear patterns.

**Impact:** I cannot reliably predict when my Proficiencies will grant benefits. This makes character building feel less strategic because I cannot map cause to effect clearly.

**Location:** Chapter 16: How Proficiencies Affect Checks

### 3. Chapter 18: Extended Tags and Conditions Reference

**Issue:** Tags are organized by thematic category rather than by mechanical effect. No alphabetical index or one-line summary table is provided for quick lookup.

**Impact:** When I need to find a specific Tag mid-session, I have to scan through narrative descriptions rather than a scannable reference. This slows down play and breaks my focus.

**Location:** Chapter 18: Tags in Depth

### 4. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Clock advancement guidance for threat clocks is vague. The book says 'failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks' but provides insufficient criteria for which clock to tick when multiple are active.

**Impact:** I cannot predict how the GM will advance clocks, making it hard to strategize around them. The system feels less pattern-based in this area.

**Location:** Chapter 9: Advancing Clocks subsection

### 5. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Skills and Proficiencies are designed for collaborative creation rather than selection from lists. Example characters are distributed across multiple chapters rather than consolidated.

**Impact:** As a pattern-driven learner, I need multiple examples to generalize the expected format. Scattered examples require more cross-referencing effort during character creation.

**Location:** Chapter 6: Steps Four and Five (Skills and Proficiencies)

### 6. Chapter 27: Sheets and Play Aids

**Issue:** The DC Ladder and Outcome Tiers quick reference exists but is positioned at the end of a long sheets chapter. Outcome tiers are not printed on the character sheet itself.

**Impact:** The most frequently needed reference material during play requires knowing to look in Chapter 27. New players may not discover this reference exists.

**Location:** Chapter 27: DC Ladder & Outcome Tiers Reference

### 7. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Position and Effect concepts are introduced here but rely on Tag and Clock understanding from Chapter 9. The relationship between these systems is implicit rather than explicitly diagrammed.

**Impact:** Understanding how combat interconnects with the core resolution system requires synthesizing information from multiple chapters. A visual diagram showing system interconnections would help.

**Location:** Chapter 10: Position and Effect in Combat


## Overall Assessment

As a pattern-driven puzzle solver with a couple years of TTRPG experience, I find Razorweave to be a thoughtfully designed system that rewards close attention to its internal logic.

Clarity & Readability (8/10): The book is well-organized with clear chapter boundaries and consistent terminology. Examples throughout demonstrate concepts concretely rather than abstractly. The main friction points are that some reference material is buried in explanatory text rather than presented in scannable formats, and the book assumes comfort with fiction-first negotiation that may take time to develop.

Rules Accuracy (9/10): The internal consistency is strong. The 4d6 resolution, Edge/Burden, Clocks, and outcome tiers follow predictable patterns that hold across chapters. When Chapter 17 references "Partial Success," it means exactly what Chapter 8 defined. When Chapter 10 uses Clocks, they work like Chapter 9 said they would. This consistency is what I need to trust a system.

Persona Fit (7/10): The system has clear patterns I can learn and internalize, which is good for my cognitive style. The DC ladder, outcome tier margins, and Edge/Burden caps are exactly the kind of concrete reference points I need. However, the fiction-first philosophy means some elements (Proficiency application, Tag relevance, Clock advancement priority) require case-by-case negotiation rather than algorithmic resolution. This is manageable but adds cognitive overhead I need to account for.

Practical Usability (7/10): During play, I expect to need quick references for outcome tiers and Tags. The book provides these in Chapter 27, but they could be more prominent. The character sheet does not include the outcome tier table, which would help. I would create my own reference cards to supplement the book. The system is learnable and the patterns are there, but extracting them into playable reference material requires some DIY effort.

What I want designers to know: Pattern-driven players like me will love your consistent resolution system and your concrete DC ladder. We appreciate that Edge and Burden have clear caps and cancellation rules. We notice and value that your examples show the math.

Where we struggle is the interpretive space around Tags, Proficiencies, and Clock advancement. We are not asking you to remove fiction-first design. We are asking for more explicit worked examples that show the decision process, not just the outcome. "The GM decided the Tag applied because..." teaches us the pattern. "The GM decided the Tag applied" leaves us guessing.

Quick-reference material should be designed for frequent access during play. Outcome tiers, DC ladder, common Tags with mechanical effects, and Clock advancement guidelines should all be on one double-sided sheet, ideally included as a perforated insert or downloadable PDF.

I will play this game. The core patterns are learnable and the system is internally consistent. I will need to do some reference-card creation and may need patient clarification from my GM in early sessions. But the foundation is solid enough to build mastery on.
