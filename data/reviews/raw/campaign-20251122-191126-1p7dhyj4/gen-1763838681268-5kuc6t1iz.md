## Narrative Feedback

As a brand new player who's mainly interested in tactical gameplay and achieving objectives, I approached the Razorweave Core Rulebook with a healthy dose of skepticism. I need a system that's going to let me make meaningful strategic choices and feel like my decisions matter - and I was cautious about whether a "fiction-first" system could deliver that.

Let me be blunt: this book is overwhelming for someone just getting started. The language is often evocative but vague. Phrases like "fiction first, mechanics second" sound nice, but what does that actually mean when I'm sitting at the table wondering if my character can pull off a risky maneuver? I spent a lot of time re-reading sections trying to figure out concrete procedures.

The chapter on "How Actions Work" is where I wanted clear, step-by-step instructions for how to resolve challenges. Instead, I got philosophy about "negotiation at the table" and "GM discretion." As someone new to RPGs, I don't have the experience to improvise these kinds of rulings. I need guardrails, not open-ended guidelines.

What frustrated me most was the lack of clear win conditions or advancement paths. The book talks about "Journeys" and character growth, but there's no clear progression system I can sink my teeth into. How do I get better? How do I measure success? The book seems almost dismissive of these concerns, emphasizing "the story matters more than winning." But I WANT to win sometimes. I want to optimize. This system doesn't seem built for players like me.

The Skills and Proficiencies system is a perfect example of my frustration. The book says players can define their own skills with GM approval, but as a newbie, I have no idea what's appropriate. The examples given are creative but don't help me understand the power level I should be aiming for. I'm skeptical that my group could handle this much freedom without experienced guidance.

On the positive side, the book is well-organized at a macro level - chapter divisions make sense and the table of contents is helpful. The visual design is professional and the synthwave aesthetic is appealing. But pretty formatting doesn't help me learn the game.

The Clocks mechanic is interesting and probably the clearest tactical element in the book. I can see how tracking progress toward objectives could scratch my strategic itch. But even here, the implementation feels loose - how quickly should clocks advance? The book offers guidelines but not rules I can rely on.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 4: How Actions Work

**Issue:** Action resolution lacks concrete step-by-step procedures

**Impact:** New players without RPG experience struggle to understand when and how to use mechanics, leading to confusion at the table

**Location:** Core Action Resolution subsection

### 2. Character Creation

**Issue:** Open-ended skill system provides insufficient guidance for newcomers

**Impact:** Inexperienced players may create unbalanced or inappropriate skills without understanding the expected power level

**Location:** Skills and Proficiencies section

### 3. Core Principles

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy prioritizes narrative over tactical gameplay

**Impact:** Players who prefer strategic optimization and clear win conditions may feel unsupported by the system

**Location:** Fiction First, Mechanics Second principle

### 4. Character Progression

**Issue:** Advancement system lacks clear metrics for success or improvement

**Impact:** Goal-oriented players have difficulty measuring progress or setting concrete character development objectives

**Location:** Journeys and Growth subsection

### 5. Clocks Mechanic

**Issue:** Clock advancement guidelines are subjective rather than prescriptive

**Impact:** Without firm rules, tactical planning becomes unreliable as outcomes depend heavily on GM interpretation

**Location:** Using Clocks in Play


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is clearly a labor of love with professional presentation and thoughtful design philosophy. However, as a new player interested in tactical gameplay and strategic optimization, I found it poorly suited to my preferences. The system embraces ambiguity and collaborative improvisation in ways that require experience I simply don't have yet.

My core concern is that this game seems designed for a very different type of player - someone who values emergent narrative over mechanical mastery, and who has enough RPG experience to fill in the procedural gaps left by the text. For a "Killer" archetype like myself who wants clear objectives and meaningful tactical choices, the book's fiction-first approach feels more like an obstacle than a feature.

I remain skeptical that I could run or play this game successfully without significant outside help or a very experienced GM to guide me. The book scores high on aspirational content but low on practical utility for newcomers with my playstyle preferences. Rating: 5.5 out of 10 - technically competent but not built for players like me.
