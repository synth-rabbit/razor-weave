## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's spent years running crunchy tactical systems, I approached Razorweave with a healthy skepticism. The weave-pool mechanics caught my attention immediately - there's an elegant pattern here that rewards system mastery while keeping the fiction front and center. The 2d6 core resolution is clean, and I appreciate how the threshold system creates predictable probability curves I can plan around.

However, I'm struggling with some of the more abstract elements. The thread mechanics feel like they want to be tactical resources I can manipulate, but the rules sometimes blur into narrative territory where my pattern-matching instincts falter. When the text says "fiction always trumps mechanics," I find myself asking: "but what ARE the mechanics, exactly?" I need clearer boundaries.

The combat examples are helpful - I can see the tactical decisions laid out. But I keep wanting reference tables for thread costs, weave regeneration rates, and action economy breakdowns. The system is asking me to trust narrative flow in places where I'd prefer to trust math.

That said, the structured approach to GM tools resonates with my style. The scenario-building frameworks give me patterns to work with, and the NPC threat-level guidelines help me balance encounters. I can work with this - I just need to build my own reference sheets.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Thread Mechanics

**Issue:** Thread spending rules are scattered across multiple sections

**Impact:** Difficult to build a mental model of the resource economy - I have to flip between chapters to understand the full cost-benefit analysis of thread expenditure

**Location:** Chapters 8-10, various subsections

### 2. Weave Pool Resolution

**Issue:** Edge cases for contested rolls lack explicit resolution procedures

**Impact:** As a pattern-driven GM, I need clear decision trees for ambiguous situations - 'GM decides' isn't a pattern I can optimize

**Location:** Core Resolution chapter, contested actions section

### 3. Combat Actions

**Issue:** Action economy isn't presented in a consolidated reference format

**Impact:** I'll need to create my own action cheat sheet before running this - the information exists but requires assembly

**Location:** Combat chapter, scattered throughout

### 4. Fiction-First Guidance

**Issue:** The balance between mechanical triggers and fictional positioning is inconsistent

**Impact:** Converting from traditional tactical systems, I need clearer signals for when fiction overrides mechanics and vice versa

**Location:** GM Guidance sections across multiple chapters

### 5. NPC/Threat Design

**Issue:** Threat-level mathematics could use worked examples with probability breakdowns

**Impact:** I want to understand WHY a Threat 3 enemy is appropriate for a 3-player group - show me the math behind the design

**Location:** GM Tools chapter, threat design section


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a genuinely interesting tactical-narrative hybrid that's asking me to evolve my GMing approach. The core mechanics are sound - I can see the patterns and appreciate the elegant probability curves. However, the book occasionally prioritizes evocative prose over mechanical precision, which creates friction for my pattern-driven brain.

For a Forever GM converting from crunchier systems, this book needs more consolidated reference materials and explicit decision procedures. The pieces are all here, but assembly is required. I'll likely run this system, but I'll be creating extensive personal reference documents first.

Rating: Promising system with presentation gaps for tactical converts. Worth the investment if you're willing to do organizational work.
