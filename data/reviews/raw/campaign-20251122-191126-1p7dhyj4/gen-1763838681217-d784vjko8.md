## Narrative Feedback

As a Tactician with several years of experience, I approach this rulebook with a focus on mechanical precision and world-simulation integrity. The Razorweave Core Rulebook presents an ambitious cyberpunk-meets-fantasy TTRPG with some genuinely interesting mechanical foundations, but struggles in areas that matter most to my play style.

**Strengths from a Tactical Perspective:**

The HEAT/GRIT/SYNC attribute system is mechanically elegant - three attributes creating meaningful trade-offs. The 2d6 resolution mechanic with its graduated success tiers (full success 10+, partial 7-9, miss 6-) gives me as a GM consistent probability distributions to work with. Edge dice as a meta-resource tied to character traits provides tactical depth without abstracting away from the fiction.

The Actions Economy (1 Major + 1 Minor per turn) combined with Zone-based positioning strikes a good balance between tactical granularity and speed of play. The equipment and cyberware systems have clear mechanical effects tied to narrative weight.

**Concerns for World-Simulator GMs:**

My primary frustration is the persistent "fiction-first" framing throughout the text. Phrases like "the fiction determines outcomes" and "narrative truth" appear frequently, but the actual mechanical procedures don't always support this philosophy cleanly. For example, the Consequence and Complication tables are helpful, but the text often suggests GMs should "follow the fiction" rather than providing deterministic guidelines.

The Combat section describes momentum shifts and environmental hazards narratively without providing consistent mechanical frameworks. When running complex tactical encounters, I need clear rules for cover values, action costs, and environmental effects - not suggestions to "let the story guide you."

**Specific Mechanical Gaps:**

1. Vehicle combat rules mention Drift, Control Tests, and Collision Damage conceptually but lack numerical specifics for many scenarios.

2. The Netrunning section introduces Firewall ratings and ICE types but the actual resolution procedures feel vague compared to meatspace combat.

3. Faction mechanics reference Heat levels and relationship tracking without providing standardized numerical scales.

**What Works Well:**

The character sheets and reference materials are excellently designed for at-table use. The wound track system (Light/Medium/Severe/Critical) with mechanical consequences is exactly the kind of deterministic framework I want. The example play transcripts actually demonstrate the mechanical procedures well.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Combat & Action

**Issue:** Cover and concealment rules lack numerical precision. Text says cover provides 'protection' and 'tactical advantage' but doesn't specify AC bonuses, damage reduction, or roll modifiers.

**Impact:** During tactical encounters, I cannot consistently adjudicate cover without improvising numbers on the spot, leading to inconsistent rulings across sessions.

**Location:** Combat Positioning and Zone Movement subsection

### 2. Chapter 7: The Digital Frontier (Netrunning)

**Issue:** Firewall breach procedures describe narrative outcomes but not mechanical resolution steps. What dice are rolled? What determines success thresholds for different Firewall ratings?

**Impact:** Cannot run Netrunning encounters with the same mechanical rigor as physical combat. Players who invest in Netrunner builds may feel their specialty is 'softer' mechanically.

**Location:** ICE Types and Firewall Ratings tables

### 3. Chapter 9: Vehicles & Chases

**Issue:** Chase sequence mechanics mention 'momentum' and 'distance' abstractly. The Range Zones system is described but specific movement costs and action requirements for closing/creating distance are inconsistent.

**Impact:** Vehicle chases require significant GM improvisation. Hard to plan encounters with predictable pacing or challenge calibration.

**Location:** Chase Mechanics Overview

### 4. Chapter 10: Game Mastering

**Issue:** Faction Heat tracking is introduced without a standardized 0-10 scale or clear mechanical triggers. The text suggests 'tracking narrative consequences' rather than numerical states.

**Impact:** As a world-simulator, I track faction relationships numerically. Without standardized scales, my tracking system may not align with the game's intended escalation curves.

**Location:** Faction Dynamics and Heat Management

### 5. Chapter 5: Gear & Cyberware

**Issue:** Some cyberware entries describe effects narratively ('enhanced reflexes provide an edge') without specifying whether this grants Edge dice, bonus to rolls, or action economy advantages.

**Impact:** Character builds focused on cyberware optimization cannot accurately assess power levels without GM interpretation, creating potential for unbalanced parties.

**Location:** Cyberware Installation and Effects


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a solid foundation for a cyberpunk TTRPG with genuine mechanical innovation, particularly in its attribute triangle and wound system. However, for a Tactician GM who values world-simulation and mechanical precision over fiction-first abstraction, the book has frustrating gaps.

The core resolution mechanics are well-defined and probabilistically sound. The problem lies in secondary systems (vehicles, netrunning, faction play) where the text leans heavily on narrative guidance rather than providing the deterministic rules frameworks that enable consistent world-simulation.

My overall rating reflects competent design with meaningful depth, but insufficient mechanical specification for GMs who want to run the world as a consistent simulation rather than a collaborative storytelling exercise. I can use this system, but I will need to create house rules for approximately 30% of edge cases the book leaves to "GM discretion."

**Recommended for:** Groups that enjoy tactical combat within a narrative framework.
**Less suitable for:** GMs seeking comprehensive mechanical coverage for all subsystems.

Rating: 6/10 - Promising core mechanics undermined by inconsistent mechanical rigor in secondary systems.
