## Narrative Feedback

As an analytical Tactician, I appreciate the logical structure of this system. My comfort with abstraction means the fiction-first mechanics don't intimidate me—I can parse the underlying systems effectively. Being a Genre-Agnostic Enthusiast, I value the flexibility to apply tactical thinking across different settings. The analytical presentation suits my cognitive style well. My Forever GM experience, though I identify as Non-GM in philosophy, means I understand both the design intent and player-facing applications. The rules hold up to analytical scrutiny.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Tactical Options

**Issue:** Could benefit from more explicit tactical decision trees

**Impact:** Tacticians seeking optimized play paths may need to derive these themselves

**Location:** Combat and conflict resolution

### 2. System Interactions

**Issue:** Some mechanical interactions could be more explicitly documented

**Impact:** Analytical players may discover edge cases not addressed in text

**Location:** Advanced mechanics sections


## Overall Assessment

A well-structured system that rewards analytical engagement. Tacticians will appreciate the logical consistency, and genre-agnostic players will enjoy the flexibility. Strong foundation for those comfortable with abstraction.
