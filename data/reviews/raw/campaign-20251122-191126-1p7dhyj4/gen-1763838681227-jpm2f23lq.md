## Narrative Feedback

Hey, so I'm coming at this as someone who's been playing TTRPGs for a couple years now - started with D&D 5e like everyone else, but I've been getting more interested in narrative games lately. The "fiction-first" approach they keep talking about? That's basically what drew me to check this out.

First off, I like how the book explains things. The writing is pretty clear and doesn't talk down to you. I especially appreciated the layered learning approach - telling you that you don't need to memorize everything before playing. That takes a lot of pressure off. As someone who's still figuring out what kind of player I want to be, having permission to learn as I go is huge.

The abstract concepts like Tags and Clocks actually make a lot of sense to me. I think in patterns and systems, so seeing how these mechanical tools represent narrative states feels natural. The Clock thing especially - it's like a visual progress bar for story tension. That clicks for me.

Where I struggle a bit is with the actual moment-to-moment play. The book explains the philosophy really well, but when it comes to "okay, but what do I actually DO at the table?" things get fuzzy. There are lots of examples, which helps, but they're scattered around. As someone still building up their GM confidence, I'd want more concrete procedures - like a flowchart or something for common situations.

The Scene Framer stuff in Chapter 5 is right up my alley since that's how I like to GM - setting up scenes and letting players drive what happens. But the book could do more to connect those abstract principles to actual session-to-session play. Like, how do I prepare for a session with this system? How do I know when to call for a roll versus when to just say "yeah, that happens"?

Overall I'm intrigued and want to try it, but I feel like I'd need to read it a couple more times before I'd feel confident running it.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Mechanics

**Issue:** Procedure gaps for new-intermediate GMs

**Impact:** Players like me who are still building confidence need more explicit guidance on when to invoke mechanics versus pure narration

**Location:** Chapters 5-7 (Action Resolution, Harm, Clocks)

### 2. Session Preparation

**Issue:** Limited guidance on pre-game prep

**Impact:** Abstract thinkers can grasp the concepts but need concrete prep procedures to translate theory into actual play

**Location:** Chapter 5 and GM sections throughout

### 3. Examples Distribution

**Issue:** Examples are scattered rather than consolidated

**Impact:** Harder to reference during play; would benefit from collected example scenarios that show complete scene resolution

**Location:** Throughout book - example boxes are contextual but not collected

### 4. Quick Reference

**Issue:** Reference sheets assume familiarity

**Impact:** The quick reference is useful for experienced players but early-intermediate players need more explanatory context even in summary form

**Location:** Chapter 27 - Quick Reference


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave strikes me as a really thoughtful system that's clearly written by people who've thought deeply about narrative play. The abstract-to-concrete explanations work well for how I think, and the fiction-first philosophy is appealing. However, as someone still finding their feet as a GM with only a few years of experience, I'd want more explicit procedures and preparation guidance. The book teaches the philosophy excellently but could do more to bridge that to actual table practice. I'd rate it a solid 7 for someone at my experience level - I can see myself running this after some more study and maybe watching actual play videos to fill in the gaps. For more experienced GMs, this is probably an 8 or 9.
