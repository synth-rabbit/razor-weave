## Narrative Feedback

As a Power Gamer who's spent years optimizing characters and mastering system interactions, approaching Razorweave has been an interesting exercise in recalibration. I'm actively converting to fiction-first play, and this rulebook provides a compelling framework for that journey - though it challenges some of my deeply ingrained habits.

The clarity of the writing is genuinely impressive. The layered learning approach ("You don't need to memorize everything before you play") is wise pedagogy, and the logical chapter progression from fiction-first principles through to advanced GM tools creates a coherent path. As someone comfortable with mechanical abstraction, I appreciate how the book explains Clocks, Tags, and Moves without over-complicating them.

However, my Power Gamer instincts keep bumping against the system's intentional ambiguity. The open-ended Skill and Proficiency lists are philosophically interesting, but I found myself wanting more concrete guidance on balance. The book says "The d12 system is stable enough that minor variations in skill choices won't break your game" - but as someone who's broken many games through creative optimization, I remain skeptical. Where are the constraints? What prevents a savvy player from constructing a skill list that dominates?

As a World Simulator GM, I was particularly drawn to Chapter 22's Campaign and World Building material. The guidance on faction clocks, location tags, and emergent narrative feels robust enough to support complex simulated worlds. The "Front Sheets" concept is excellent for tracking world-state. However, I wanted more mechanical depth in the Domain Play chapter - the procedures for managing larger-scale conflicts feel underdeveloped compared to character-scale mechanics.

My experimental cognitive style appreciates that Razorweave encourages procedural flexibility. The book explicitly invites adaptation ("No rule in this book is sacred"). But I sometimes wished for clearer decision trees or flowcharts. The "What to Read First" guidance is helpful, but actual procedural diagrams would aid my systematic approach to learning new systems.

The dice probability tables (d4 through d12 comparisons) are exactly the kind of technical material I crave, though I wanted more analysis of edge cases and probability distributions under various modifier combinations. The mathematical transparency is refreshing but incomplete.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 4: Character Creation

**Issue:** Open skill/proficiency lists lack optimization guidance

**Impact:** Power gamers may struggle to assess relative power levels, potentially creating unbalanced characters or spending excessive table time negotiating with GMs about skill validity

**Location:** Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies subsection

### 2. Chapter 20: Domain Play

**Issue:** Domain-scale mechanics lack the mechanical depth of character-scale play

**Impact:** World Simulator GMs seeking to run complex faction-level campaigns will need to develop significant house rules to achieve satisfying depth

**Location:** Domain Play chapter overview

### 3. Core Resolution Mechanics

**Issue:** Modifier stacking rules could be clearer

**Impact:** Experienced players seeking to optimize character effectiveness may misinterpret how multiple bonuses and penalties interact, leading to table disputes

**Location:** Dice mechanics and modifiers section

### 4. Chapter 22: Campaign and World Building

**Issue:** Faction interaction procedures are narratively focused rather than mechanically deterministic

**Impact:** GMs who prefer simulating world events through consistent mechanical resolution may find the guidance insufficiently procedural

**Location:** Factions and Clocks subsection

### 5. Learning Structure

**Issue:** Procedural flowcharts and decision trees are absent

**Impact:** Systematic learners who prefer visual procedural guides must construct their own mental models from prose descriptions, slowing initial system mastery

**Location:** How to Use This Book / What to Read First


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave represents a thoughtful bridge between traditional RPG structures and fiction-first design philosophy. For a Power Gamer in conversion mode like myself, it provides enough mechanical scaffolding to feel grounded while pushing toward more narrative approaches. The writing quality is high, the pedagogical structure is sound, and the core dice mechanics are elegantly transparent.

However, the system's intentional openness creates friction for optimization-minded players. The lack of explicit balance constraints, combined with GM-arbitrated skill/proficiency validity, may frustrate those seeking clear character-building guidelines. Similarly, World Simulator GMs will find the faction and domain mechanics philosophically aligned but mechanically thin.

I rate this 7/10 for my particular use case. It's a system I can work with and adapt, but I'll need to develop house rules for domain play depth and create my own reference materials for procedural clarity. The experimental framework is here; the optimization opportunities require excavation.
