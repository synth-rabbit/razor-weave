## Narrative Feedback

As a Storyteller still converting to fiction-first approaches, this book presents a learning curve. My wariness of abstraction means some mechanics feel untethered from the concrete storytelling I'm used to. As a Railroad Conductor, I appreciate narrative control, but the system's emphasis on player agency and emergent play conflicts with my preferred structured approach. My long-term GM experience helps me parse the rules, and my abstract/analytical thinking aids comprehension, but the philosophical alignment isn't quite there for my style.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Player Agency

**Issue:** Heavy emphasis on player-driven narrative may challenge directive GMs

**Impact:** Railroad Conductor style GMs may struggle to maintain planned story arcs

**Location:** Core philosophy and GM guidance

### 2. Abstraction Level

**Issue:** Abstract mechanics may feel disconnected for those wary of abstraction

**Impact:** Converting players may need more concrete bridges between fiction and mechanics

**Location:** Core resolution mechanics

### 3. Narrative Control

**Issue:** Limited tools for maintaining GM narrative authority

**Impact:** Storytellers seeking to guide specific narratives may find system resistance

**Location:** GM tools and principles


## Overall Assessment

A challenging fit for Storytellers converting from traditional systems, especially those wary of abstraction and preferring directive GM styles. The system's philosophy may require significant adjustment for Railroad Conductor approaches. Best suited for those willing to embrace collaborative narrative.
