## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so I finally got through this rulebook after a few evenings when the kids were asleep. Here's my honest take as someone who doesn't have hours to spend memorizing rules.

**The Good Stuff:**
First off, I really appreciate that the book tells you upfront you don't need to memorize everything before playing. That's exactly what I need to hear. The "fiction first" approach is great - it means I can focus on what my character is doing instead of constantly looking up rule numbers.

The core dice system (4d6, add your attribute) is pretty straightforward once you get it. I like that the outcome isn't just "pass/fail" - those partial successes keep things interesting even when you don't roll great. The examples throughout really help, especially the ones showing the same situation handled different ways.

**What Made My Eyes Glaze Over:**
Here's where I struggle. The Edge/Burden system makes sense in theory, but in practice I kept having to flip back to remember how many extra dice to roll and whether I keep the best or worst. A simple reference card would save me so much time.

The Tags and Conditions system is... a lot. I get that "Dim Light" and "Slick" affect my rolls, but with dozens of possible tags floating around, I'm worried I'll miss something important during play. My group isn't going to pause while I hunt through Chapter 18.

And honestly? 30 chapters is intimidating. I know Part III is mostly GM stuff, but the book doesn't clearly enough separate "what players need to know" from "what GMs need to know." I found myself reading stuff I'll never use since I'm just a player.

**At the Table Reality:**
I've only got maybe 3-4 hours of focused gaming per month between work and family. This book assumes I can internalize a lot of interconnected systems. The Clocks replacing HP is cool conceptually, but it's another thing to track that HP would have handled more simply.

The character creation chapter is solid - the 9 steps are clear and the Rella example really helps. But I wish there was a quick-start option for when I just want to roll up a character in 20 minutes before a one-shot.

**Bottom Line:**
This is a well-written rulebook with clear explanations and good examples. But for a casual player like me who just wants to sit down and have fun without extensive prep, it asks for more mental bandwidth than I'd like. I'll probably lean heavily on my GM to handle the fiddly bits while I focus on the roleplay.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, Outcomes

**Issue:** Edge/Burden dice mechanics require memorization of specific dice counts (5d6 keep 4, 6d6 keep 4, etc.)

**Impact:** Slows down play when I have to look up whether +1 Edge means rolling 5 or 6 dice

**Location:** Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions subsection

### 2. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Large number of potential tags to track without a consolidated quick-reference

**Impact:** Risk of forgetting relevant modifiers during fast-paced scenes

**Location:** Common Tag Categories and Extended References in Chapter 18

### 3. Book Structure

**Issue:** Player-essential content not clearly distinguished from GM-only content

**Impact:** Casual players may waste time reading sections they don't need

**Location:** Part II and Part III organization

### 4. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** No quick-start or simplified character creation option for one-shots

**Impact:** Time-constrained players may find 9-step creation process too lengthy

**Location:** Character Creation process

### 5. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clocks replacing HP adds conceptual overhead

**Impact:** Players familiar with HP systems need extra mental adjustment

**Location:** Resolve Instead of Hit Points subsection


## Overall Assessment

RAZORWEAVE is a thoughtfully designed game that prioritizes storytelling over number-crunching. For players who have time to really learn the system, it probably sings. For me, juggling work, kids, and a monthly game night? It's asking for more investment than I can reliably give.

I'd give it a solid recommendation for groups with dedicated players who enjoy learning interconnected systems. But if you're like me - someone who wants to show up, make some rolls, and enjoy a story without extensive homework - you'll want a very patient GM and probably a cheat sheet or two.

The core ideas are good. The presentation is clear. The examples help. But the total package is heavier than it initially appears, and that weight shows up when you're trying to actually play.

Rating: 6.75/10 - Good game, but prepare for a learning curve that might be steep for casual tables.
