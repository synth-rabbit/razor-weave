## Narrative Feedback

Alright, so I've been running solo campaigns for about six years now, and I have to say - this rulebook really gets what makes solo play tick. The dedicated Chapter 26 on Alternative Play feels like it was written by someone who actually plays alone, not just someone who tacked on solo rules as an afterthought.

The VPC system is the star here. I love that VPCs are explicitly designed as "mirrors and sounding boards" rather than driving the story themselves. That's exactly the right approach. When I'm playing alone, I want companions who help me think through decisions, not ones that feel like I'm running a whole party by myself. The advice about using VPCs to ask questions or offer imperfect plans ("We could take the main road and risk the checkpoints, unless you see another way") - that's gold. It's the kind of specific, actionable guidance that actually helps at the table.

The oracle system integration is solid too. Using Tags and Clocks with "Yes/No/Complication" prompts feels natural and genre-agnostic, which suits my tendency to jump between cozy mysteries one week and gritty sci-fi the next. The example with the abandoned station and the Security Systems Wake Clock immediately clicked - I could see exactly how to use it.

The core 4d6 system with Edge and Burden is mechanically elegant. I appreciate that it caps at +/-2 so I don't have to track stacking bonuses. The margin-based outcome tiers (critical success, full success, partial, failure, critical failure) give me enough granularity to interpret oracle results meaningfully without getting bogged down in charts.

Character creation feels experimental-friendly, which I value. Open skill and proficiency lists mean I can create weird character concepts without fighting the system. The example character Rella (telegraph engineer searching for patterns in strange messages) is exactly the kind of off-beat concept I'd want to play.

A few things tripped me up though. The journaling guidance in Chapter 26 mentions using "Session Log and Advancement Tracker sheets from Chapter 28" but when I got there, I had to hunt around for the specific sheets. Some clearer cross-referencing or sheet titles in the solo section would help. Also, while the oracle advice is good, I wish there were more pre-built tables for different genres - the book mentions creating "short tables for genre-specific twists" but leaves most of that work to me.

For practical table use, the outcome interpretation guidance is strong. Partial successes that "trade progress for cost rather than stopping action" keeps momentum going, which is critical when you're playing alone and there's no one to bounce off of if things stall.

Overall, this is a rulebook I could actually use for solo play, not just adapt.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 26 - Alternative Play

**Issue:** Cross-reference to play aid sheets is vague

**Impact:** Minor friction when trying to locate referenced sheets during solo setup

**Location:** Solo Play - Journaling and Record-Keeping section

### 2. Chapter 26 - Alternative Play

**Issue:** Genre-specific oracle tables are mentioned but not provided

**Impact:** Players must create their own genre-specific prompts from scratch, adding prep overhead for solo play

**Location:** Using Oracles and Prompts section

### 3. Table of Contents

**Issue:** Some chapter titles in TOC are unhyphenated slugs (e.g., 'welcome-to-the-game', 'glossary') instead of proper titles

**Impact:** Minor confusion when scanning TOC; inconsistent presentation

**Location:** TOC sidebar navigation

### 4. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Markdown formatting artifacts visible in text (asterisks around emphasis)

**Impact:** Some example text shows '*Trigger:*' instead of properly formatted italics, reducing readability

**Location:** Example callout boxes


## Overall Assessment

As a solo player with an explorer mindset, this rulebook delivers what I need most: a flexible system that supports solo play as a first-class mode rather than an afterthought, combined with a fiction-first philosophy that lets me discover stories through play.

The combination of VPCs for companionship, oracles for uncertainty, and Clocks for pacing gives me a complete toolkit. The genre-agnostic design means I can run the weird, experimental one-shots I enjoy without hacking the system every time.

Where it falls slightly short is in practical table aids - I'd love more pre-built oracle tables, clearer sheet references, and some polishing of formatting artifacts. But these are refinements, not dealbreakers.

I'd give this rulebook a confident recommendation to other solo players, especially those who value narrative emergence over mechanical complexity. It respects the unique challenges of playing alone while keeping the core experience coherent with group play.
