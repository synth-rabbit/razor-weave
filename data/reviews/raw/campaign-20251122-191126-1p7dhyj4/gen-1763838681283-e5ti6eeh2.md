## Narrative Feedback

As a Forever GM who's deeply invested in the social dynamics at my table, Razorweave speaks my language in ways I didn't expect from a core rulebook. The fiction-first approach isn't just theory here - it's woven into every procedure and piece of guidance. For someone who's been running games for years with the primary goal of bringing players together through shared narrative experiences, this system feels like it was designed with my style in mind.

What strikes me most is how the book acknowledges the GM as a facilitator of collaborative storytelling rather than an adversary or sole arbiter of truth. The prepared sandbox philosophy shines through in how the book discusses scene framing, clock management, and world-building. I can prep my environments, NPCs, and situations, then let the players' choices drive the narrative direction. The clock mechanics particularly appeal to my Complexity Tolerant nature - they add meaningful stakes without overwhelming the table with crunch.

The "Native" fiction-first alignment the book assumes works perfectly for my groups. We already think in terms of "what would your character do?" before reaching for dice, and Razorweave's core resolution loop validates that instinct. The way Tags emerge from fiction rather than being selected from lists resonates with how I've always preferred to handle character capabilities.

For my Socializer archetype, the collaborative elements are exceptional. The section on player safety, calibration, and consent demonstrates an understanding that RPGs are fundamentally about people first, games second. The guidance on running Session Zero conversations and establishing Lines and Veils shows thoughtful consideration of table dynamics.

I appreciate the layered learning approach. I can introduce new players to the core loop quickly, then reveal additional complexity as they become comfortable. This is crucial for maintaining the social cohesion I prioritize - nobody gets left behind mechanically while we focus on the shared narrative experience.

The narrative tools - Clocks, Tags, and the position/effect framework - give me exactly what I need: structured scaffolding that never overshadows the fiction. As someone who prefers narrative tools over tactical crunch, these hit the sweet spot of providing enough mechanical texture to make decisions feel meaningful without pulling focus from character moments and story beats.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 5: Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** GMless play mode needs more procedural depth for prepared sandbox GMs transitioning to shared authority

**Impact:** GMs who want to occasionally step back and participate as players need clearer protocols for rotating scene authority and maintaining prepared content in a leaderless context

**Location:** GMless Cooperative Play subsection

### 2. Chapter 11: Running Scenes

**Issue:** Scene transition guidance focuses heavily on pacing but underserves the social check-in moments

**Impact:** Socializer GMs benefit from explicit guidance on reading the room between scenes - when players need breaks, when emotional beats need processing time, when to shift energy levels

**Location:** Scene Transitions and Pacing sections

### 3. Chapter 15: Clocks and Consequences

**Issue:** Clock visibility and player communication patterns could use more nuanced discussion

**Impact:** The social dynamics of hidden vs. visible clocks significantly affect table trust and player agency perception - more guidance on when transparency serves group cohesion would help

**Location:** Using Clocks at Your Table

### 4. Chapter 3: Core Principles

**Issue:** The 'Play to Find Out' principle could better address GM prep anxiety for prepared sandbox styles

**Impact:** Forever GMs who invest significant prep time need reassurance that their preparation remains valuable even when player choices take the story in unexpected directions

**Location:** Play to Find Out What Happens


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave delivers an exceptionally well-designed fiction-first system that aligns beautifully with my Forever GM, Socializer priorities. The prepared sandbox approach the book supports - with its emphasis on meaningful prep that remains flexible to player agency - matches my preferred GMing style precisely. The complexity tolerance the system assumes is appropriate; these are rich mechanics that reward engagement without becoming burdensome.

The book's greatest strength for my archetype is its implicit understanding that RPGs are social activities first and games second. The safety tools, collaborative world-building guidance, and consent-forward framing demonstrate mature design philosophy.

My concerns are relatively minor: the GMless mode needs more procedural support for GMs wanting to occasionally experience shared authority, and the social facilitation aspects of scene management could be more explicitly addressed. These feel like gaps that could be filled in supplementary materials rather than fundamental design issues.

I rate this an 8.25/10 for my specific use case. The system delivers exactly what a fiction-first Forever GM with Socializer priorities needs: a robust framework for collaborative storytelling that provides mechanical texture without overshadowing human connection. I'm already planning my first campaign and thinking about which of my player groups would benefit most from this approach. Highly recommended for GMs who view their role as facilitating memorable shared experiences rather than running tactical combat simulations.
