## Narrative Feedback

As a player with several years of experience who primarily explores game worlds rather than running them, I found the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a well-organized and accessible read. The fiction-first approach that the book advocates is something I have been curious about for a while, and this rulebook does an excellent job explaining what that actually means in practice.

The "Core Concepts at a Glance" section at the beginning is particularly valuable. It gives me a concrete understanding of what I am getting into before diving deeper. I appreciate that the book explicitly tells me I can begin play after reading just the first six chapters - that kind of guidance helps me prioritize what to learn first.

The character creation process is structured clearly with numbered steps. As a concrete thinker, I like having that explicit sequence: concept first, then identity elements, then attributes, and so on. The example character Rella helps ground the abstract steps in something tangible. I can picture what each step looks like in practice.

The check system using 4d6 against a DC with margin determining success tiers is straightforward once I understood it. The three conditions for when to roll (Uncertainty, Consequence, Agency) give me a clear mental framework. I can now recognize when the GM should call for a check versus just narrating success.

What I find less satisfying is the coverage of exploration as a play activity. The book mentions different modes like solo play and campaign play, but I would have liked more concrete procedures for discovering things in the world. How do I as a player approach investigating strange patterns or uncovering hidden locations? The fiction-first philosophy suggests the answer lies in describing what I do, but more examples of exploratory scenes would help.

The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks system seems powerful but abstract. I understand what they do conceptually, but I had to read through the examples multiple times to feel confident about how they work in practice. A flowchart or quick reference for "when do I use which tool" would help someone like me who processes information better through concrete examples than abstract principles.

Overall, the book respects my time and gives me the tools I need to participate meaningfully at the table. The fiction-first approach is explained well enough that I feel I understand the philosophical shift it represents, even if I am still curious to see how it plays out in actual sessions.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** Exploration procedures are underdeveloped

**Impact:** Players who enjoy discovery-driven play have less guidance on how to structure exploratory scenes or pursue investigation through the fiction-first lens

**Location:** Chapter 5, various play mode descriptions

### 2. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Abstract concepts need more concrete scaffolding

**Impact:** Concrete thinkers may need multiple readings to internalize when and how to apply these tracking mechanisms

**Location:** Chapter 9, particularly the 'What Clocks Are' and 'Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks' subsections

### 3. Character Creation

**Issue:** Skills and Proficiencies are open-ended without sufficient guardrails

**Impact:** New players or those unfamiliar with fiction-first games may struggle to create appropriate entries without GM guidance

**Location:** Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies subsection

### 4. Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy is well explained but could use more player-facing examples

**Impact:** Players who are curious about fiction-first may understand the concept but still be uncertain about how to apply it from a non-GM perspective

**Location:** Fiction First, Mechanics Second principle


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook succeeds as an introduction to fiction-first tabletop gaming. For experienced players curious about this approach, the book provides solid explanations of what fiction-first means and why it matters. The structure is logical, the writing is clear, and the examples help ground abstract concepts.

As an Explorer archetype, I was hoping for more explicit support for discovery-driven play. The system clearly supports investigation and exploration, but the book focuses more on general scene structure and conflict resolution than on the specific rhythms of exploration. This is not a failure - just a gap that I hope future supplements might address.

The 4d6 resolution system and the Tag/Condition/Clock toolkit give the game mechanical teeth without overwhelming the fiction. I came away feeling that I understand enough to participate meaningfully in a session, though I would want to see the system in action before feeling fully confident.

Rating: 7.5 out of 10. A strong foundation that satisfies my curiosity about fiction-first play, with room to grow in supporting specific play styles like exploration-focused campaigns.
