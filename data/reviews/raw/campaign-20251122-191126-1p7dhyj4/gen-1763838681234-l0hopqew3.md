## Narrative Feedback

As an Explorer who bounces between running games and playing in them, Razorweave immediately grabbed my attention with its layered approach to learning. The book explicitly tells you that you don't need to memorize everything at once - that's exactly how I approach new systems. I want to poke around, try things, and discover mechanics organically rather than front-loading all the rules.

The fiction-first philosophy resonates deeply with my Curious nature. I love when games encourage you to describe what you're attempting and then figure out the mechanical implications. The "Describe what you're doing, then determine the mechanic" flow feels natural for the way I like to explore both as a player making unexpected choices and as a GM watching players surprise me.

What really excites me is the open-ended nature of Skills and Proficiencies. Rather than a fixed list, you can create your own based on character concept. As someone who's always trying experimental character builds and unusual approaches, this freedom is exactly what I want. I can already imagine the weird niche proficiencies I'd create for various characters.

The Clock system caught my eye as well - I appreciate how it tracks progress toward something without arbitrary timing. When I'm experimenting with different narrative approaches at the table, having flexible pacing tools is essential. The way Threads and Clocks interact gives me interesting levers to pull.

The Core Loop is elegantly simple: Describe, Determine, Resolve, Apply. That's a framework I can internalize quickly and then experiment within. I don't need to constantly reference charts - I can focus on pushing boundaries and seeing what happens.

However, I did find myself wishing for more examples of edge cases and unusual situations. When I'm in experimental mode, I often end up in weird corners of the rules. The book provides solid fundamentals but fewer "what if" scenarios for someone who likes to stress-test systems.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: The Core Loop

**Issue:** Limited edge case coverage for unusual player approaches

**Impact:** Experimental players may need to improvise rulings more often when trying unconventional tactics, which could slow down the exploratory play style

**Location:** Determine and Resolve phases

### 2. Chapter 8: Consequences

**Issue:** Consequence severity guidance could be more granular

**Impact:** When experimenting with high-risk approaches, it's harder to calibrate whether a consequence should be 'just a setback' or 'campaign-altering' without more examples

**Location:** Consequence severity guidelines

### 3. Chapter 12: Clocks and Threads

**Issue:** Thread mechanics feel underdeveloped compared to Clocks

**Impact:** As a hybrid GM/Player, I want to engage with long-term narrative arcs from both sides of the screen, but Threads need more concrete guidance for player-initiated narrative threads

**Location:** Thread creation and advancement sections

### 4. Chapter 17: Resolution Mechanics

**Issue:** Multiple success/failure tiers are great but examples focus on standard situations

**Impact:** When players try experimental approaches that don't fit neat categories, the examples don't help calibrate outcomes as much as they could

**Location:** Mixed Success and Complicated Success descriptions


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is an excellent fit for exploratory play styles. The fiction-first approach, open-ended character customization, and flexible pacing tools all support the kind of curious, experimental gameplay I gravitate toward. The system gives you room to breathe and discover rather than constraining you to predetermined paths.

For hybrid GM/Players like me, the Core Principles chapter is particularly valuable - it helps you understand the game's philosophy deeply enough to switch roles fluidly. The emphasis on collaboration and shared narrative authority works well whether you're behind the screen or at the table.

My main critique is that the book assumes relatively conventional play within its framework. More examples of edge cases, unusual character concepts, and experimental narrative structures would help Explorers like me feel fully supported when we inevitably push into uncharted territory.

Overall: 8 out of 10. This system rewards curiosity and experimentation, even if it could do more to explicitly support the weird corners we Explorers love to find.
