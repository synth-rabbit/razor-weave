## Narrative Feedback

As a Power Gamer who's run campaigns for years, I approached Razorweave looking for a system I could sink my teeth into - one with clear mechanical levers I could optimize and tight procedures I could master. I'm in the process of converting to fiction-first systems, but I still need concrete numbers to anchor my understanding. And here's where Razorweave frustrates me.

The book is well-written and the synthwave aesthetic is evocative. The layered learning approach in Chapter 1 is smart pedagogy. But when I dig into the actual mechanical content, I find a system that's deliberately vague where I need precision.

Take the dice system: the basic resolution mechanic using 2d6 is clean enough, and I can work with the 6-/7-9/10+ tiers. But then we get to Clocks and Conditions, and the book becomes maddeningly imprecise. How many segments should a Clock have for a given obstacle? The book says "typically 4, 6, or 8" but gives no concrete guidance on calibrating difficulty. As someone who likes to pattern-match mechanical relationships, I'm left without the data I need.

The open-ended Skill and Proficiency lists are another friction point. Yes, I understand the fiction-first philosophy - you define what makes sense for your character. But as a GM who runs tight, directed campaigns, I need to know what's mechanically balanced. The book assures me the system is "forgiving" but doesn't tell me what the actual failure modes look like. When a player proposes an overpowered skill combination, how do I evaluate it? What are the benchmarks?

The Tag system is elegant in theory but lacks the crunch I crave. Tags are "fiction-first mechanical markers" - but what do they actually DO in terms of dice math? The book explains they can grant +1 Forward or access to new options, but there's no comprehensive table showing all tag effects and their mechanical weights.

Where Razorweave succeeds for my play style is in its procedural clarity for scene structure. The GM Actions and Moves framework gives me a clear pattern to follow. I can work with "Reveal an Unwelcome Truth" and "Offer an Opportunity, with a Cost" because these are concrete, repeatable procedures. This is the pattern-driven design I respond to.

But the gap between the clear procedural framework and the fuzzy fictional-positioning mechanics creates cognitive dissonance. The system seems to want me to trust my fiction-first instincts, but my instincts demand numbers.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Clocks and Conditions

**Issue:** No concrete guidelines for Clock segment calibration

**Impact:** GMs who rely on mechanical consistency cannot properly balance encounters or long-term threats without trial and error across multiple sessions

**Location:** Creating and Using Clocks subsection

### 2. Chapter 3: Character Creation

**Issue:** Open Skill/Proficiency lists lack balance benchmarks

**Impact:** Power gamers may exploit ambiguity, while conscientious players may under-optimize; no clear yardstick for equivalence

**Location:** Skills and Proficiencies - The Lists Are Open

### 3. Chapter 6: Core Dice Mechanics

**Issue:** Modifier stacking and Forward/Ongoing interactions unclear

**Impact:** Cannot plan optimal character builds or mechanical strategies because the ceiling and floor of bonus stacking is undefined

**Location:** Modifiers and Circumstances

### 4. Chapter 7: Tags System

**Issue:** Tag mechanical weights not systematized

**Impact:** Pattern-driven learners cannot build mental models of relative tag value; leads to inconsistent adjudication at the table

**Location:** Tag Types and Applications

### 5. Chapter 5: Ways to Play

**Issue:** Railroad Conductor style not explicitly supported

**Impact:** GMs who prefer structured, directed campaigns receive less procedural support than player-driven sandbox modes

**Location:** GM-Led Traditional Play


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a professionally written, aesthetically compelling TTRPG that commits fully to fiction-first design philosophy. For Power Gamers converting from traditional systems, this presents a significant adaptation challenge. The system provides excellent procedural clarity for moment-to-moment GM decisions but deliberately avoids the mechanical precision that optimization-focused players use to engage with games.

The book's strengths - clear prose, layered learning, evocative examples - are real and valuable. But the gaps in mechanical specificity (Clock calibration, Tag weighting, modifier ceilings) will frustrate players who learn through pattern recognition and need concrete numbers to build mental models.

I rate this 5/10 for my specific use case. The foundation is solid and the design philosophy is coherent, but I would need significant house-ruling or supplementary materials to run this system in my preferred directive style. Recommended for GMs ready to fully embrace fiction-first improvisation; not recommended for Power Gamers still anchored to mechanical optimization frameworks.
