## Narrative Feedback

Okay, I have to say this upfront: I've been waiting for a rulebook like this for years. As someone who made the jump from traditional games to more narrative-focused indie systems about five years ago, I've read a LOT of "fiction-first" games that talk the talk but don't actually deliver. Razorweave? It delivers.

The opening chapters immediately signal that this is a game built by people who understand what fiction-first actually means. Chapter 4's Core Principles of Play reads like a manifesto I could have written myself. "The Table Is a Creative Team" - yes! "Player Intent Drives Action" - exactly! "Failure Creates Momentum" - THIS is what so many games get wrong. Failure isn't a punishment here; it's a narrative opportunity. That's the heart of good story gaming.

The character creation process in Chapter 6 is beautifully structured. Starting with concept before touching any numbers, defining identity elements that give the character depth, then letting Skills and Proficiencies emerge naturally from who the character IS - this is exactly how character creation should work. The example character Rella (the telegraph engineer with cipher fragments) isn't just a stat block; she's a person I can imagine at my table. I love that her Proficiencies in Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools aren't just mechanical tags but signals about what kinds of scenes she'll shine in.

The 4d6 resolution with Edge/Burden is elegant without being fiddly. I've suffered through too many games that claim narrative focus but then drown you in modifier math. The DC Ladder (12-Easy to 22-Legendary) is intuitive enough that I could teach my Wednesday night group the basics in about five minutes. And the way Tags and Conditions flow from the fiction rather than feeling like video game status effects? Genuinely impressive design work.

Chapter 8's treatment of "When to Roll (and When Not To)" deserves special praise. The three conditions for a Check - Uncertainty, Consequence, Agency - are exactly right. Too many games roll for everything; this one understands that rolling should focus attention on interesting uncertainty, not gate every action.

The GM guidance throughout is superb. Chapter 13 on Roleplaying Guidance shows genuine understanding of how collaborative play works - the advice on spotlight sharing, reading the table, and the examples of inviting quieter players into scenes feel like wisdom from actual play experience, not theoretical design principles.

The combat system using Resolve Clocks instead of hit points keeps fights feeling like story beats rather than attrition wars. That's a huge win for the kind of dramatic, paced action sequences I want to run.

I particularly appreciate that this is a complete book. So many indie games feel like they need a PhD in "the way we meant it to be played" to actually run. This one gives you everything: character creation, core resolution, GM tools, campaign frameworks, and even sheets and play aids. It respects my time as a busy adult who wants to run games, not study design theory.

If I'm being honest about room for improvement - the alternative play modes (GMless, Solo) feel underdeveloped compared to the GM-led sections. Chapter 5 mentions these options but the procedural support isn't as thorough. For someone like me who occasionally runs solo sessions between campaign games, I'd love to see more structured oracle procedures and scene-framing tools.

Overall though? This is exactly the kind of game I want to evangelize to my friends who are still playing systems that treat story as decoration on top of combat math. Razorweave takes narrative gaming seriously while providing enough mechanical structure to satisfy players who need something to hold onto. That's a rare and valuable combination.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 5 - Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** GMless Cooperative Play and Solo Play sections lack the procedural depth found elsewhere in the book

**Impact:** Medium - These play modes are mentioned but players looking to actually run GMless or solo sessions will need to improvise significant structure

**Location:** Chapter 5, GMless Cooperative Play and Solo Play subsections

### 2. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The interaction between Proficiencies and Checks could be more explicitly defined - text says Proficiencies 'often do not require a roll' but the exact conditions remain somewhat ambiguous

**Impact:** Medium - Experienced players will intuit this, but explicit guidance would reduce table discussions about when Proficiencies apply vs modify

**Location:** Chapter 6 (Proficiencies) and Chapter 8 (Checks) - the relationship between these chapters

### 3. Chapter 4 - Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Example boxes show 'Example Example' pattern (duplicate labels in formatting)

**Impact:** Low - Visual noise that doesn't affect comprehension but looks unpolished

**Location:** Multiple example boxes throughout Chapter 4

### 4. Cross-Genre Application

**Issue:** While the book mentions genre flexibility (cozy, horror, sci-fi), concrete examples of how the same mechanics feel different across genres are sparse throughout

**Impact:** Medium - Would significantly help GMs calibrate tone for their specific campaigns, especially for less experienced GMs trying different genres

**Location:** Throughout - particularly Chapters 4, 8, 10, and 21 could benefit from more genre-specific worked examples

### 5. Chapter 13 - Roleplaying Guidance

**Issue:** Safety tools section is brief - mentions 'lines and veils' but doesn't explain the technique for newcomers

**Impact:** Low - Most experienced players will know these tools, but a brief explanation would help tables new to safety mechanics

**Location:** Chapter 13, Session Zero and Safety subsection

### 6. Skills and Proficiencies System

**Issue:** The 'open list' approach to Skills and Proficiencies is powerful but may overwhelm players used to fixed lists - more genre-specific starter lists would help

**Impact:** Medium - The flexibility is a strength but some players need more scaffolding when creating custom entries

**Location:** Chapters 14-17 Skills and Proficiencies references


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is exactly the kind of game I've been hoping the narrative gaming space would produce. It successfully bridges the gap between structured traditional systems and the more freeform indie games I've come to love, without sacrificing the strengths of either approach.

For players like me - people who came to tabletop gaming through traditional systems but discovered the joy of fiction-first play through indie games - this book delivers exactly what it promises. The 4d6 resolution with Edge/Burden is mechanically satisfying without becoming the focus of play. The character creation process prioritizes who your character is before what they can do. The GM guidance is genuinely useful, not generic advice dressed up in system-specific terminology.

The system's greatest strength is its consistency of vision. From the opening "fiction first" declaration to the detailed GM tools in later chapters, everything reinforces the core principle that story comes first and mechanics serve the fiction. The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks framework is particularly well-designed - it provides narrative weight without mechanical bloat, letting consequences feel meaningful without requiring players to track complex subsystems.

The Roleplaying Guidance chapter (13) deserves special recognition. The advice on spotlight sharing, reading the table, and collaborative play reads like wisdom from years of actual table experience. The examples - like the one about inviting a quiet player into a scene by acknowledging their character's local knowledge - are genuinely helpful, not just illustrative.

Areas for improvement are relatively minor but worth noting: the alternative play modes need more procedural support, the Proficiency/Check interaction could be clearer, and the genre flexibility would benefit from more worked examples showing the same rules in different genre contexts. None of these prevent the book from being immediately usable, but they represent opportunities for future development.

I would confidently recommend this to any player or GM looking for a system that takes narrative gaming seriously while providing enough mechanical structure to feel grounded and satisfying. This is the kind of rulebook that could convert skeptics and delight enthusiasts. It's going straight to my "recommend first" list.

Rating Summary:
- Clarity & Readability: 9/10 - Exceptionally well-written with clear organization and excellent use of examples
- Rules Accuracy: 8/10 - Consistent internal logic with minor ambiguities around Proficiency interactions
- Persona Fit: 10/10 - Perfect match for narrative-focused experienced players who want both story and structure
- Practical Usability: 8/10 - Ready to play with excellent reference materials; alternative modes need more support
