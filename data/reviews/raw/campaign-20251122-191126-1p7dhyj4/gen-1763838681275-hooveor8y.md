## Narrative Feedback

As an Explorer who's curious about fiction-first approaches, I find this book opens interesting doors for discovery and world-building. My preference for narrative tools is mostly satisfied, though I'd love more concrete examples since I think in concrete terms. As a Scene Framer, the structure supports my GM style, but as someone who prefers focused systems, the breadth sometimes feels overwhelming. The hybrid GM/Player experience helps me see both sides, but clearer scene-framing guidance would help tremendously.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Scene Management

**Issue:** Abstract scene-framing concepts without concrete examples

**Impact:** Concrete thinkers may struggle to apply scene-framing techniques

**Location:** GM guidance sections

### 2. System Scope

**Issue:** Broad system may lack focus for those preferring specialized tools

**Impact:** Explorers seeking deep dives into specific areas may find coverage shallow

**Location:** Throughout core mechanics

### 3. Examples

**Issue:** Could use more concrete play examples

**Impact:** Concrete thinkers need tangible examples to grasp abstract concepts

**Location:** Rules explanations


## Overall Assessment

A curious and explorable system that rewards discovery, though concrete thinkers and those preferring focused systems may need additional support. Good for hybrid GM/Players who can adapt on both sides of the screen.
