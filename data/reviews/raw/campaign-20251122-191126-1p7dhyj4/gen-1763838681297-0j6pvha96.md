## Narrative Feedback

Look, I've been playing TTRPGs for over fifteen years now. I've seen every iteration of D&D, played Pathfinder when it was crunchy and again when it streamlined, dabbled in Fate and PbtA systems. I came to Razorweave because I'm tired of spending three hours on character builds and want something that actually moves the story forward while still giving me meaningful tactical decisions.

The good news: the core resolution system is elegant. Four attributes, flexible skills, and a single Check structure that handles everything. I appreciate not having to remember seventeen different subsystems. The fiction-first philosophy is stated clearly and consistently - that's refreshing after years of games that claim to be narrative but bury you in exception-based rules.

But here's where my Killer instincts kick in and I start seeing problems.

First, the open Skills and Proficiencies system. I understand the design intent - flexibility, collaborative worldbuilding, genre agnosticism. But for someone like me who wants to optimize without breaking the game, the lack of concrete boundaries is frustrating. The book says the GM has "final approval" but gives precious little guidance on what scope is appropriate. Am I overpowered with "Combat Tactics" or underpowered with "Knife Fighting"? The examples scattered through the text help somewhat, but I want a clearer framework for evaluation.

Second, the attribute spread at character creation (2/1/1/0) is extremely flat. I get that this supports the fiction-first ethos - characters aren't defined by huge stat disparities. But as a veteran player, I know that narrow ranges mean individual decisions matter less mathematically. Where's my agency in building a character who excels at what they do? The system seems to rely heavily on fictional positioning rather than mechanical advantage, which is fine philosophically but thin on the concrete numbers I need to feel like my choices matter.

Third, combat and physical challenges feel underspecified. For a Killer archetype, I need to understand the tactical landscape. The Tags and Conditions system is interesting but abstract. How much damage is "serious harm"? What's the action economy in a fight? The book gestures toward these answers but rarely pins them down. I spent twenty minutes looking for a concrete example of multi-round combat and couldn't find one that satisfied my need to understand the mechanical flow.

The partial success mechanic is genuinely interesting - it creates story momentum and avoids binary pass/fail. That appeals to my converting-toward-fiction-first sensibilities. And the Clocks system for tracking dangers and opportunities is intuitive and visual. These are tools I can see using at my table.

But I keep coming back to the same issue: I want this game to tell me what the numbers mean. When I roll, I want to know the probability spread. When I advance my character, I want to see how much stronger I've become in measurable terms. The book keeps saying "the fiction is the authority" but sometimes I just want the math to back up my tactical decisions.

As a Simplicity Seeker, I appreciate that the core loop is learnable in one session. The chapter organization makes sense for reference. The examples are helpful when they appear. But the simplicity comes at the cost of precision, and for my playstyle, that's a trade I'm not always willing to make.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Skills and Proficiencies System

**Issue:** No bounded list or clear scope guidelines for custom entries

**Impact:** As a player who wants to optimize effectively, I cannot evaluate whether my choices are appropriately powerful without extensive GM negotiation. This creates table variance and potential conflict.

**Location:** Chapter 6 - Character Creation, "Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies" section

### 2. Combat Resolution

**Issue:** Lack of concrete combat examples showing action economy, damage tracking, and multi-round tactical flow

**Impact:** As a Killer archetype focused on combat effectiveness, I cannot evaluate tactical options or plan character builds around combat competence without clearer mechanical examples.

**Location:** Expected in Chapters 7-13 (core resolution) but absent or scattered

### 3. Attribute Spread Flatness

**Issue:** The 2/1/1/0 starting spread creates minimal differentiation between characters mechanically

**Impact:** Player agency in character building feels diminished when the mathematical impact of choices is compressed into a narrow range. Veterans may feel their optimization choices matter less.

**Location:** Chapter 6 - Step Three: Assign Attributes

### 4. Fiction First vs Concrete Numbers

**Issue:** The book emphasizes fictional positioning over mechanical precision but provides insufficient translation between narrative descriptions and quantified outcomes

**Impact:** For players converting from crunchier systems who still want concrete numbers to anchor decisions, the lack of explicit probability guidance or damage scales creates uncertainty.

**Location:** Throughout, but especially Chapters 4 and 7

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a competently designed fiction-first system that will work well for groups already comfortable with narrative authority and collaborative play. The core mechanics are elegant and the writing is clear. However, for veteran players with Killer tendencies who are converting from crunchier systems, the lack of concrete mechanical boundaries, flat attribute spreads, and underspecified combat systems create friction. I would recommend this to players who prioritize story flow over tactical depth, but I need more time with the system to determine if the fiction-first philosophy actually delivers satisfying gameplay for optimization-minded players like myself. It's a qualified recommendation with reservations about long-term engagement for my playstyle.
