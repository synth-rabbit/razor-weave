## Narrative Feedback

As a long-term GM who has heard countless systems promise "fiction-first" play while delivering the same old mechanical grind, I approached Razorweave with measured skepticism. What I found was a system that genuinely attempts to deliver on its narrative promises, though with some notable friction points for someone with my GMless advocacy.

The core resolution mechanic using a single d20 with advantage/disadvantage is elegantly simple, and I appreciate that the system explicitly frames outcomes in narrative terms rather than pure success/failure binaries. The distinction between Controlled, Risky, and Desperate situations is borrowed from better narrative games and works well here.

However, my analytical eye catches several inconsistencies. The Momentum system, while narratively framed, functions essentially as a traditional action economy with extra steps. For a GMless advocate like myself, the heavy GM-dependent framing throughout the book is disappointing. Phrases like "the GM decides" and "ask your GM" appear repeatedly where the system could instead offer structured procedures for shared narrative authority.

The character creation process is mechanically sound but frontloads complexity in ways that undermine the fiction-first ethos. Why am I choosing stat arrays and calculating derived values before I have established who my character is in the fiction? A truly fiction-first approach would start with the character concept and derive mechanical elements from that narrative foundation.

The synthwave aesthetic is visually striking but occasionally prioritizes style over substance in the layout. Some tables are harder to parse than necessary due to the color scheme choices.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Momentum Economy

**Issue:** The Momentum system is presented as a narrative pacing tool but mechanically functions as a traditional action economy with resource tracking.

**Impact:** For GMs seeking genuine fiction-first play, this creates cognitive dissonance between the narrative framing and the mechanical reality of counting and spending points.

**Location:** Core Mechanics chapter, Momentum section

### 2. GM Authority Concentration

**Issue:** The system heavily centralizes narrative authority in the GM role with repeated "GM decides" language, despite potential for more distributed authority structures.

**Impact:** As a GMless advocate, this design choice excludes entire play styles and contradicts the implied flexibility of fiction-first design. The game could support troupe-style or rotating GM play with minimal mechanical changes, but the text actively discourages this.

**Location:** Throughout, particularly in the GM Guidance sections and resolution procedures

### 3. Character Creation Sequence

**Issue:** Character creation begins with mechanical choices (stat arrays, derived calculations) before establishing fictional identity, inverting the expected fiction-first flow.

**Impact:** New players, especially those attracted by the fiction-first marketing, may be confused or turned off by the traditional mechanical frontloading. The process should lead with "who is your character?" not "what numbers do you want?"

**Location:** Character Creation chapter, first three sections

### 4. Incomplete Procedure Documentation

**Issue:** Several core procedures lack the step-by-step specificity that would enable consistent table experiences or support GMless play adaptations.

**Impact:** Analytical players and GMs seeking to understand exact resolution sequences will find gaps that require interpretation. This is particularly problematic for organized play or online asynchronous games where procedural clarity is essential.

**Location:** Combat procedures, Extended Tests, Downtime activities

### 5. Glossary Cross-Reference Gaps

**Issue:** Key terms are used before being defined, and the glossary does not consistently match in-text usage of game terminology.

**Impact:** For analytical readers attempting to build a complete mental model of the system, these inconsistencies create unnecessary friction and repeated page-flipping.

**Location:** Glossary chapter, various mechanical terms

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a competent narrative-leaning TTRPG that delivers approximately 70% of what its fiction-first positioning promises. The core mechanics are sound and the synthwave aesthetic is distinctive. However, the system falls short for GMless advocates and highly analytical players due to its conventional GM authority structure and occasional mechanical-narrative friction. It would benefit from an explicit GMless variant appendix and a reorganized character creation flow that leads with fiction. Recommended for groups with a dedicated GM who values narrative pacing, but not ideal for troupe play or those seeking fully distributed narrative authority.
