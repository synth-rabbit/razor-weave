## Narrative Feedback

I came to this rulebook with a very specific question: can I play this alone?

After seven years of solo roleplaying across everything from journaling games to oracle-driven Ironsworn campaigns, I have developed a particular radar for systems that will work at a table of one. Razorweave gave me mixed signals, and I need to talk through them.

The fiction-first philosophy is immediately appealing. When you are playing solo, you are already doing everything through the lens of narrative. There is no GM to tell you what happens; you are constantly imagining, interpreting, and deciding. A system that starts from "what makes sense in the story" rather than "what do the rules say" aligns perfectly with how solo play actually works.

The 4d6 core mechanic is clean and produces a satisfying spread of outcomes. I ran some test scenes using the system, rolling for my character and against imagined opposition, and the five outcome tiers (Critical Success through Critical Failure) gave me enough variety to keep things interesting without requiring constant table lookups. The Partial Success band at -1 to -2 is particularly useful for solo play because it creates complications without requiring GM adjudication. The fiction tells you what went wrong.

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are exactly the kind of tools that make solo play sing. When I am playing alone, I need external structures that push back against my narrative. Clocks do this beautifully. They represent threats advancing whether or not I pay attention to them. They create the pressure that a GM would otherwise provide. The Tag system gives me a vocabulary for describing scenes that has mechanical teeth.

Here is where things get complicated for solo play.

Chapter 26 mentions "Alternative Play" and specifically addresses solo play, but the coverage feels thin for someone who has been doing this for years. The section acknowledges that solo play is possible and provides some high-level guidance, but it does not deeply engage with the unique challenges of playing without a GM. Where are the oracle tables? Where is the guidance on how to adjudicate your own Checks fairly? How do I decide when a Clock ticks if I am both the player and the world?

The Proficiencies system, while narratively elegant, presents a challenge for solo play. Proficiencies are meant to give you Edge or lower DCs when your background applies, but this requires interpretation. In group play, you pitch your Proficiency to the GM and they decide if it applies. Playing solo, I am making that decision for myself, which creates a temptation to always find a reason why my Proficiency applies. The book does not address this tension.

The VPC rules in Chapter 24 are interesting but assume someone else is running them against you. As a solo player, I would need to develop my own procedures for running adversaries, and while the building blocks are here, the assembly instructions are not.

What I found myself doing, experimentally, was combining Razorweave's resolution system with oracle techniques I have learned elsewhere. Ask a binary question, roll a d6 for yes/no with complications on certain results, then use the full 4d6 Check when I need to resolve an action with stakes. This works, but it requires bringing outside tools to the table.

The Skills and Proficiencies chapters are comprehensive but assume collaborative definition with a GM. For solo play, I would want more structured guidance on selecting from pre-defined options rather than creating custom entries through negotiation.

What does work brilliantly is the overall structure. The character sheet gives me everything I need to understand who my character is and what they can do. The Clocks give me pacing. The outcome tiers give me direction when I do not know what happens next. The Tags give me scene texture. The genre-agnostic design means I can take this system through cyberpunk investigations, fantasy expeditions, or cosmic horror without fighting against baked-in assumptions.

I ran a three-scene test adventure: investigating strange lights at an abandoned relay station. The Perception and Awareness Skill combined with the Investigation Skill gave me tools for discovering information. The "Alert" and "Dim Light" Tags created atmosphere and mechanical consequence. A six-segment "Station Powers Up" Clock gave me stakes. It worked. Not smoothly, but it worked.

The book is honest about what it is. It says it is designed for cooperative play with a GM presenting the world. Solo play is mentioned as an alternative mode, not the primary design target. I respect that honesty. But as someone who primarily plays alone, I wish there was more scaffolding for my particular mode of engagement.

If you are a solo player considering Razorweave, know that you will be doing some adaptation work. The core engine is solid and the fiction-first philosophy aligns well with solo play values. But you will need to bring your own oracles, develop your own procedures for self-adjudication, and accept that some rules assume a conversation partner you do not have.

I will keep experimenting with this system. The foundation is too interesting to abandon. But I am hoping future supplements address solo play more directly.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 26: Alternative Play

**Issue:** Solo play section provides high-level acknowledgment but lacks specific procedures, oracle tables, or guidance for self-adjudicating Checks and Clocks.

**Impact:** Solo players must import external tools or develop their own procedures, raising the barrier to entry for the solo community.

**Location:** Chapter 26: Alternative Play - Solo Play subsection

### 2. Chapter 16-17: Proficiencies System

**Issue:** Proficiencies require GM interpretation to determine when they apply. Solo players face the challenge of fairly adjudicating their own Proficiency claims without external validation.

**Impact:** Risk of self-favoring interpretations or, conversely, overly harsh self-judgment. The collaborative negotiation model does not translate cleanly to solo play.

**Location:** Chapter 16: When Proficiencies Apply; Chapter 17: Default Benefits sections

### 3. Chapter 24: NPCs, VPCs, and Enemies

**Issue:** VPC rules assume GM operation. No guidance for running adversaries against yourself in solo play, including how to make tactical decisions for enemies without favoring either side.

**Impact:** Solo players must develop their own adversary AI procedures, which is a significant design burden.

**Location:** Chapter 24: Running VPCs in Play

### 4. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Skills and Proficiencies encourage custom creation through GM collaboration. Solo players lack a defined list to select from, requiring more upfront creative work without validation.

**Impact:** Character creation takes longer for solo players and may result in poorly calibrated custom elements.

**Location:** Step Four: Choose Skills; Step Five: Choose Proficiencies

### 5. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The Check procedure assumes someone calls for a Check based on fiction. Solo players must develop internal criteria for when to roll versus when to simply narrate, which the book does not address.

**Impact:** Risk of over-rolling (losing narrative flow) or under-rolling (avoiding uncertainty). No guidance on calibration for solo context.

**Location:** Chapter 8: When to Call for a Check

### 6. Chapter 9: Clocks

**Issue:** Clock advancement on GM moves or offscreen threats is elegant for group play but ambiguous for solo. When does a solo player tick a Pressure Clock if they are not taking actions related to it?

**Impact:** Solo players need their own timing rules for passive Clock advancement, potentially using scene boundaries or oracle results.

**Location:** Chapter 9: Advancing Clocks; Chapter 8: Clocks and Checks

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a thoughtfully designed fiction-first system that I want to love for solo play but cannot fully embrace in its current form.

The core engine is excellent. The 4d6 resolution produces meaningful variance. The five outcome tiers create story opportunities without requiring constant reference. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks provide the external structure that solo play desperately needs. The genre-agnostic design means I can take this anywhere my imagination leads.

The writing is clear, the examples are helpful, and the principles are sound. This is a well-crafted rulebook that knows what it wants to be.

For solo players specifically, Razorweave sits in a frustrating middle ground. It is not hostile to solo play the way some crunchier systems are, but it is not built for it either. The collaborative assumptions run deep: GM adjudication of Proficiencies, GM operation of adversaries, GM calls for Checks, GM advancement of Clocks. Every one of these assumptions requires adaptation for the solo context.

I rate Persona Fit at 7/10 because the system's strengths align with solo play values (fiction-first, flexible, not genre-bound) but its procedures assume a conversation partner. Practical Usability drops to 6/10 because actually running this solo requires importing external tools and developing house rules for fundamental procedures.

An experienced solo player with a toolkit of oracles and self-adjudication techniques will find a solid foundation here. A newcomer to solo roleplaying looking for a complete package will struggle.

I am going to keep playing with this system. The experimental part of my brain is already designing oracle procedures and solo frameworks that could sit on top of these rules. That is the kind of creative challenge I enjoy. But I want to be honest: this book does not meet me where I am. It asks me to do the work of adaptation, and while I am willing, not every solo player will be.

For the designers: consider a solo play supplement. The foundation is strong. The community is there. Give us the procedures we need, and this could become a go-to system for solo explorers like me.
