## Narrative Feedback

Finally. A rulebook that gets it.

I spent years running D&D before I discovered Apocalypse World and had that moment where everything clicked into place. Fiction first was not just a philosophy; it was permission to play the way I had always wanted to. Since then, I have been evangelical about narrative-first design, and Razorweave feels like it was written by someone who understands why that matters.

The opening chapters do something remarkably brave: they put "fiction first" right at the front, not as an afterthought or a sidebar, but as the foundational principle. Chapter 1 tells you the story comes first and mechanics support the story. Chapter 4 explicitly states that mechanics never replace the shared imagination of the table. That is not just lip service. The entire system is built around that promise.

The intent and approach framework is beautifully elegant. Instead of players fishing for the "right" skill to roll, they describe what their character wants to achieve and how they are trying to achieve it. The GM then chooses the appropriate Attribute based on that description. This is exactly how narrative games should work: the fiction determines the mechanics, not the other way around.

I love that the same goal can be resolved with different Attributes depending on approach. Opening a stuck hatch could be MIG (brute force), AGI (picking the lock), PRE (convincing someone to open it), or RSN (analyzing weak points). That flexibility keeps players thinking in terms of their character rather than optimizing their character sheet.

The Tags, Conditions, and Clocks system is a natural evolution of narrative tools I have seen in Blades in the Dark and similar games. Tags are descriptors that shape the fiction: Dim Light, Crowded, Tense. Conditions follow characters around until cleared. Clocks track progress toward goals and threats. These are not tracking abstract hit points; they are tracking the state of the story.

The Resolve system instead of hit points in combat is a chef's kiss. A character is taken out when the story supports it, not when they hit zero. A VPC might quit the field when cornered, not just at "0 HP." This keeps combat tied to character, genre, and story rather than pure attrition.

The collaborative GM philosophy runs deep. The book repeatedly emphasizes that the table is a creative team, that players own their characters, and that the GM presents the world honestly rather than as a tool to control players. Safety tools are integrated naturally, not as an afterthought.

There are a few areas where I wanted more. The Skills and Proficiencies chapters provide frameworks but encourage collaboration with the GM to define custom entries. That is philosophically sound but might leave some players feeling unmoored without more concrete examples. The variant rules chapter is comprehensive but could benefit from clearer guidance on which combinations work well together.

But these are minor quibbles. This is a rulebook that trusts its players to tell stories together and provides elegant tools to support that process. It feels like coming home.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Skills and Proficiencies section encourages custom definitions but provides limited concrete examples for players unfamiliar with open-ended design.

**Impact:** New players coming from traditional games might feel overwhelmed by the freedom and lack of a comprehensive skill list.

**Location:** Step Four: Choose Skills and Step Five: Choose Proficiencies sections

### 2. Chapter 20: Optional and Variant Rules

**Issue:** The variant rules are comprehensive but the table formatting breaks in places (visible in the Pacing Options table), making some options harder to parse.

**Impact:** GMs trying to customize their campaign may miss useful options due to formatting issues.

**Location:** Pacing Options table and following variants

### 3. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The relationship between Edge/Burden and DC modification could be clearer. Both are presented as ways to handle favorable/unfavorable circumstances, but guidance on when to use each approach is minimal.

**Impact:** GMs may apply both Edge and DC changes to the same situation, making Checks swing too wildly.

**Location:** Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions subsection

### 4. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** The Resolve Clock system is brilliant conceptually but practical guidance on sizing clocks for different threat levels is sparse.

**Impact:** GMs new to clock-based combat may struggle to calibrate appropriate challenge levels.

**Location:** Resolve Instead of Hit Points section

### 5. General: Examples Throughout

**Issue:** Many examples use the same fictional conceit (telegraph engineers, canal towns, relay hubs) which grounds the text but may not translate to all genres.

**Impact:** Players wanting to run fantasy or sci-fi may need to do more mental translation work than necessary.

**Location:** Various example boxes throughout Chapters 1-13

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is the fiction-first rulebook I have been waiting for. It takes the best lessons from the narrative games revolution and packages them into a coherent, well-structured system that supports multiple genres and play styles.

For someone like me who has spent years evangelizing fiction-first play, this book feels like validation. It proves you can build a complete, mechanically interesting system around the principle that story comes first. The 4d6 core mechanic is simple enough to teach quickly but deep enough to support meaningful decisions. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks provide the narrative scaffolding that keeps the world feeling alive and responsive.

The book excels at explaining not just what the rules are but why they exist and when to use them. That philosophical grounding makes it easier to adjudicate edge cases and maintain consistency across sessions.

If you have played PbtA games, Forged in the Dark, or any other narrative-focused system and wished for something that scaled to longer campaigns with deeper mechanical engagement, Razorweave delivers. If you are still playing traditional games and wondering what all the fuss about fiction-first design is about, this might be the book that opens your eyes.

I will be running this at my table. I will be recommending it to everyone I know. This is the good stuff.
