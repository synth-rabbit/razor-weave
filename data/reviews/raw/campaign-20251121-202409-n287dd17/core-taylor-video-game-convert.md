## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so I just spent way too long trying to understand this rulebook, and I have some strong opinions. Coming from video games where the stats screen tells you exactly what everything does, this is a completely different experience. And honestly? It is frustrating in some ways, but also kind of cool in others.

Let me start with what actually makes sense. The dice system is solid. Roll 4d6, add your Attribute bonus, compare against a DC. That is basically a skill check like in any RPG. The DC ladder gives me hard numbers: Easy is 12, Routine is 14, Tough is 16, Hard is 18, Heroic is 20, Legendary is 22. I can actually calculate my odds. With 4d6 averaging around 14, I know roughly what I am working with.

The Edge and Burden system is clever too. It is like having advantage and disadvantage from other games I have heard about, but with an interesting twist. +1 Edge means I roll 5d6 and keep the best 4. +2 Edge means 6d6 keep best 4. Burden is the reverse, keeping the worst dice. This is the kind of mechanical crunch I can sink my teeth into. The cap at plus or minus 2 and the cancellation rules prevent the math from getting out of control.

The four Attributes (Might, Agility, Presence, Reason) map pretty well to what I am used to from character builds. Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Intelligence, basically. The starting spread of 2-1-1-0 is simple enough. Though I have to say, going from games where I can have stats ranging from 1 to 99, having everything be 0 to 2 feels really limited. Where is my power scaling?

Here is where I start to struggle. The book keeps talking about "fiction first" and I genuinely do not understand what that means in practice. In a video game, I press the attack button and the game calculates the outcome. Here, apparently I am supposed to describe what my character does, and then the GM decides if I even need to roll? What if I just want to roll dice and see numbers go up?

The Skills and Proficiencies section made me want to throw the book across the room. There is no list. Let me repeat that: THERE IS NO SKILL LIST. The book says I should "work with the GM to define custom entries that reflect the character's experiences." What does that even mean? How am I supposed to know if my skill is too broad or too narrow? In every game I have played, there is a talent tree or a skill list. You pick from the options. You build your character. Here it is all... negotiation? What if my GM and I disagree about what "Technical Work" should cover?

Combat is where I expected to feel most at home, and it is also where I felt most lost. Instead of hit points, there are "Resolve Clocks"? A clock is a circle divided into segments that you fill in. I get that visually, but the book never actually tells me how many segments a successful attack fills. There is an example that mentions 2 segments for Full Success and 1 for Partial Success, but that is in an example box, not in the actual rules. Is that the rule? Is it just a suggestion? I need concrete numbers here.

The outcome tiers are actually pretty good once I mapped them to what I know. Critical Success at margin +5 or higher is like landing a crit. Full Success at 0 or higher is a normal hit. Partial Success at -1 to -2 is like a glancing blow that still does something but costs you. Failure at -3 or below is a miss. Critical Failure at -7 or all 1s is the fumble. That framework makes sense.

What does NOT make sense is all this GM discretion stuff. "The GM decides whether a Check is needed." "The GM sets the DC." "The GM interprets the outcome." In a video game, the system handles all of that consistently. Here, I am supposed to trust someone to make fair calls every single time? What if they set the DC too high because they do not like my plan? What if partial successes always mean bad things happen to me specifically?

I know I am being skeptical, but I came from systems where I could look at a tooltip and know exactly what my ability did. Here I read a whole chapter on Attributes and still do not know if my Might 2 character can reliably break down a door or not. The answer is apparently "it depends on the fiction" which is the tabletop equivalent of "undefined behavior."

The book does have some genuinely useful reference material. The DC ladder table is bookmarkable. The Edge and Burden rules are clear and consistent. The outcome tier definitions give me something to anchor to. The glossary at the end actually defines terms precisely, which I wish the rest of the book did.

One thing I will give credit for: the Tags and Conditions system is a good attempt at systematizing status effects. Instead of random homebrew, there are defined states like "Exposed" or "Slick" that have predictable mechanical impacts. That is game design I can respect. It is like having standardized debuffs instead of just "the GM says you are at disadvantage because reasons."

The Clocks concept from the game they apparently borrowed it from is interesting. Having a visual progress tracker with 4, 6, or 8 segments is intuitive. Knowing that filling a Clock triggers a specific outcome is good game design. I just wish Combat used them more consistently with actual numbers attached.

Bottom line: This system is built for people who already know how tabletop RPGs work and enjoy the collaborative storytelling aspect. For someone like me who wants clear character progression, defined abilities, and predictable outcomes, there is a significant learning curve. The core math is sound, but everything around it requires trusting other humans to make consistent rulings, and that is a skill I have not developed yet.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. No Standardized Skill or Proficiency List

**Issue:** The system provides no default list of Skills or Proficiencies, requiring player-GM negotiation

**Impact:** For a new player, this creates paralysis. I do not know what options exist, how broad skills should be, or what is considered reasonable. Coming from games with defined talent trees, this is completely foreign and intimidating.

**Location:** Chapter 6 - Character Creation, Steps Four and Five; Chapter 14 - Skills System Overview

### 2. Resolve Clock Advancement Not Codified

**Issue:** No explicit rule stating how many Clock segments combat actions fill

**Impact:** The only guidance is buried in an example box (2 segments for Full Success, 1 for Partial). This should be a clearly stated rule, not an inference from an example. Combat pacing will vary wildly between tables.

**Location:** Chapter 10 - Combat Basics, Resolve Instead of Hit Points section

### 3. Fiction First Philosophy Inadequately Explained

**Issue:** The book repeatedly references "fiction first" without explaining what this means in practical terms

**Impact:** For players used to mechanical resolution, the concept of the narrative determining when dice are rolled (instead of vice versa) is confusing. More concrete examples of fiction-first vs mechanics-first play would help.

**Location:** Chapter 2 - Core Concepts; Chapter 4 - Core Principles of Play

### 4. GM Discretion in DC Setting

**Issue:** DCs are set entirely by GM judgment with only vague guidelines

**Impact:** Without standardized difficulty benchmarks for common actions (breaking down a door, picking a lock, convincing a guard), outcomes feel arbitrary. A reference table of typical DCs for common actions would be valuable.

**Location:** Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes, Setting DCs section

### 5. Limited Attribute Range Creates Flat Power Curve

**Issue:** Starting Attributes range from 0-2 with slow advancement

**Impact:** For players expecting meaningful stat growth and power scaling, the narrow range feels constraining. The book could better explain why this design choice supports the system goals.

**Location:** Chapter 7 - Characters and Attributes, Attribute Ratings section

### 6. Combat Turn Structure Loosely Defined

**Issue:** Action economy described as "one main action" plus "small alongside actions" without specifics

**Impact:** Coming from games with clearly defined action economies (move, standard, bonus, reaction), the vague structure makes planning turns difficult. I want to know exactly what I can do.

**Location:** Chapter 10 - Combat Basics


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave has a mechanically sound core that I can actually work with. The 4d6 resolution system, the DC ladder, the Edge/Burden dice modification, and the outcome tier margins all give me concrete numbers I can calculate and plan around. These are the bones of a good system.

However, this rulebook is clearly not written for video game converts like me. It assumes comfort with GM discretion, collaborative worldbuilding, and narrative-first thinking that I simply do not have yet. The lack of standardized Skill lists, the vague combat pacing rules, and the heavy reliance on table negotiation all create friction for players who want defined options and predictable outcomes.

If I were playing with an experienced GM who could guide me through the fiction-first mindset and make consistent rulings, this system might click. But reading the book alone, I feel like I am missing crucial context that veterans take for granted.

Score: 5.75/10 - A mathematically elegant system buried under layers of assumed tabletop experience. The core resolution is excellent, but new players from video game backgrounds will struggle without significant table support.
