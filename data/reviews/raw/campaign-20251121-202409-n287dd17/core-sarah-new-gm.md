## Narrative Feedback

Okay, I just finished reading through the Razorweave Core Rulebook, and I have a lot of thoughts. As someone who is brand new to being a GM - I have maybe run three sessions total, all with pre-made adventures - this book both excites me and terrifies me in equal measure.

Let me start with what I really appreciate. The "fiction first" philosophy makes so much sense to me. The book says right up front that I do not need to memorize everything, and that the story comes first. That is incredibly reassuring because I have been worried about messing up rules. When Chapter 4 says "failure creates momentum" and "partial success is a core story beat," I actually felt less anxious about my players rolling badly. The idea that failure just bends the story rather than stopping it? That is honestly brilliant.

The Rella example in Character Creation (Chapter 6) was exactly what my brain needed. Following along with a concrete character being built step by step made all the abstract stuff click. When the book showed "Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0" and then explained what that means for Rella as a telegraph engineer, I understood the system way better than just reading the rules. I wish there were more examples like this throughout.

The 4d6 + Attribute versus DC system is clean and makes sense. The DC ladder from 12 (Easy) to 22 (Legendary) gives me something concrete to work with. And I love that Edge and Burden use extra dice instead of fiddly modifiers - that is visual and tactile in a way that works for me.

But here is where I start getting worried. The Skills and Proficiencies system says players should "work with their GM to define custom entries." But I AM the GM! Who do I work with? When the book tells me that a good Proficiency should be "neither so broad that it covers everything nor so narrow that it rarely matters," I genuinely do not know where that line is yet. I do not have the experience to calibrate that. If a player proposes "Athletics" versus "Climbing" versus "Rock Climbing in Caves," I cannot tell which scope is right.

The Clocks system sounds amazing on paper. I love the visual of filling in segments as tension rises. The Skybridge Sabotage example in Chapter 23 made me want to run that exact scenario. But then I started thinking about actually doing it: tracking "Explosives Planted" (4 segments), "Security Lockdown" (6 segments), AND "Public Blame Misplaced" (8 segments) while also describing scenes, running NPCs, and responding to player creativity? My head is spinning. The book says "start small" but does not tell me HOW small. Is one clock enough for my first session? Should I have two? Three feels like too many but the examples keep showing multiple clocks.

Chapter 10's Resolve Clock for combat really appeals to me - no hit points to track! But I do not understand when exactly to tick it. The book says "successful Checks tick the Clock forward" but successful checks by whom? The attacker? The defender? And how many segments for a punch versus a sword versus a critical hit? The worked examples show outcomes but skip the specific "this is when you tick" guidance I need.

The GM chapters (21-26) have good principles but they assume I have intuitions I have not developed yet. "Present the world honestly" - okay, but what does that sound like? What words do I say? "Frame scenes with purpose" - what is a purposeful frame versus a bad one? I need more before-and-after examples of actual GM speech at the table.

What I really wish existed: a complete starter scenario with pre-built everything. Pre-made NPCs with sample dialogue. Pre-set Clocks with guidance on exactly when to tick them. A flowchart for "when the players do X, respond with Y." Something where I do not have to make judgment calls on my first night. The book's flexibility is its strength for experienced GMs but its weakness for someone like me who needs training wheels.

The visual design is gorgeous though. The electric blue and hot pink color scheme catches my eye and the torn-paper edges on example boxes make them pop. The table of contents with clickable navigation is exactly what I need for quick reference. These are the kinds of concrete, visual touches that help me learn.

Overall: I believe this system could be wonderful once I grow into it. The philosophy resonates with me. The core dice mechanic is elegant. But right now, reading it feels like being handed a very nice set of cooking knives and being told "just follow your instincts" when I have never made anything more complicated than scrambled eggs. I need recipes before I can improvise.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6 - Character Creation

**Issue:** Open-ended Skill and Proficiency creation assumes GM experience that new GMs lack

**Impact:** New GMs cannot evaluate whether player-proposed Skills/Proficiencies are appropriately scoped without baseline examples

**Location:** Step Four (Choose Skills) and Step Five (Choose Proficiencies) - text says "work with GM to define custom entries" but provides insufficient calibration guidance

### 2. Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Clock management complexity escalates without scaffolding for beginners

**Impact:** New GMs may be overwhelmed tracking multiple simultaneous Clocks while also running scenes, NPCs, and responding to player actions

**Location:** What Clocks Are section - examples consistently show 2-3 active Clocks without explaining how to start with just one

### 3. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock tick triggers are insufficiently specified

**Impact:** New GMs cannot determine exactly when to advance Clocks during combat without clear conditional rules

**Location:** Resolve Instead of Hit Points section - "successful Checks tick the Clock forward" lacks specificity on whose success, what magnitude of action, and segment quantity

### 4. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** DC-setting guidance relies on judgment new GMs have not calibrated

**Impact:** New GMs may set wildly inconsistent DCs without more situational examples per difficulty tier

**Location:** Setting DCs section - DC ladder provided (12-22) but application guidance is limited to "imagine what success would look like"

### 5. Chapter 21 - Running Sessions

**Issue:** GM principles stated abstractly without concrete speech examples

**Impact:** New GMs understand WHAT to do conceptually but not HOW to verbalize it at the table

**Location:** GM Mindset and Framing Scenes sections - principles like "present the world honestly" need transcribed examples of actual GM speech

### 6. Chapter 23 - Scenario Design

**Issue:** Worked examples assume intermediate GM capability

**Impact:** Excellent scenario-building framework but no "absolute beginner" starter template with pre-filled elements

**Location:** Worked Example: The Skybridge Sabotage - demonstrates building blocks but does not provide a ready-to-run minimal scenario

### 7. Chapter 7 - Characters and Attributes

**Issue:** Attribute-to-approach mapping could use more edge case examples

**Impact:** When players describe approaches that could fit multiple Attributes, new GMs lack guidance on choosing

**Location:** Attributes, Intent, and Approach section - shows clear cases but not ambiguous ones

## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a thoughtfully designed, narratively focused TTRPG that prioritizes story over number-crunching. For my needs as a brand-new GM who is a concrete thinker, prefers visual learning, and wants a Prepared Sandbox play style, it scores moderately but not perfectly.

**Strengths for someone like me:**
- Fiction-first philosophy reduces my fear of "breaking" the game
- Clean 4d6 core mechanic with visual Edge/Burden dice system
- Excellent character creation walkthrough with Rella example
- Beautiful visual design that aids navigation and reference
- Failure-as-momentum philosophy reduces performance anxiety

**Challenges for someone like me:**
- Open-ended Skill/Proficiency system needs more guardrails
- Clock management complexity not scaffolded for true beginners
- GM guidance relies on intuition I have not developed
- Missing: complete starter scenario with pre-built everything
- Combat resolution (Resolve Clock ticks) needs clearer triggers

I would recommend this system to new GMs who have an experienced mentor available, or who have played (but not run) other narrative-focused games like Dungeon World or Blades in the Dark. For someone truly new to TTRPGs with no experienced friends to guide them, this book might be overwhelming without supplementary "getting started" materials.

My hope is that future supplements include a "New GM Toolkit" with ready-to-run scenarios, pre-generated NPCs with dialogue trees, and step-by-step session guides. The core system is elegant - it just needs more on-ramps for people like me who are still learning to drive.
