## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has been sitting behind the screen for what feels like forever, running everything from dungeon crawls to political intrigue to slice-of-life mysteries, the Razorweave Core Rulebook immediately speaks my language. This is a system that fundamentally *trusts* the GM while giving us the tools we need to make the story sing.

### What Clicks for Me as a Forever GM

The fiction-first philosophy is exactly what I have been gravitating toward in my own evolution as a GM. After years of crunchy systems where I spent more time adjudicating modifiers than describing dramatic moments, Razorweave says what I have come to believe: the story comes first, and mechanics exist to support uncertainty and consequence, not to replace imagination. The three-question test for when to call for a Check (uncertainty, consequence, agency) is something I will be carrying into every game I run from now on.

The **Tags, Conditions, and Clocks** system is where this book really shines for a systems-integrator like me. I love seeing how these simple building blocks can model almost anything--from environmental hazards to social tension to faction movements. The way Clocks work as both progress trackers and pressure generators gives me exactly the kind of dynamic tension I want at my tables. The "Guards Converge" Clock filling segment by segment while players debate their next move? That is the good stuff.

Chapter 21 ("Running Sessions") feels like it was written for me specifically. The GM mindset section articulating our role as "facilitator of consequences" rather than adversary or passive narrator crystallizes what I have learned through years of practice. The practical advice about framing scenes with Tags, using Clocks to show the world moving, and keeping DCs tied to fictional context--this is all gold.

### The System Integrator's Appreciation

What particularly impresses me is how well the subsystems interconnect. Attributes flow into Skills flow into Proficiencies, with Tags and Conditions layering on top, and Clocks tracking everything from personal injury to faction movements. As someone who loves understanding how all the pieces fit together, I find this architecture elegant and satisfying.

The flexibility of Skill-Attribute pairing is brilliant. The same "Streetwise" Skill can pair with PRE when schmoozing a barkeep, RSN when piecing together rumors, or AGI when navigating rooftop escape routes. This keeps the system from feeling like a straightjacket while maintaining mechanical coherence.

The Proficiency system as "narrative permission first, mechanical bonus second" is exactly the right framing. It answers the question of who gets to attempt something before we even reach for dice.

### Genre-Agnostic Enthusiasm Confirmed

I have run games in fantasy, horror, sci-fi, cozy contemporary, and weird combinations of all of the above. This system feels genuinely portable. The genre-variant examples scattered throughout (cozy neighborhood campaigns, telegraph-age mysteries, relay station sci-fi) demonstrate that the core mechanics can handle wildly different tones and settings. The consistent advice to change Tags and Clocks rather than rebuild the system for each genre is practical and reassuring.

### Areas for Attention

Despite my enthusiasm, a few sections gave me pause:

The **combat chapter** feels slightly undercooked compared to the excellent social and exploration guidance. While I appreciate the abstraction and the "Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw" action economy, some examples of more complex tactical situations would help GMs translate the principles into varied combat scenarios.

The **GM section on NPCs and VPCs** is thorough, but I would have appreciated more guidance on pacing the introduction of VPCs in ongoing campaigns. When should a helpful NPC graduate to VPC status? How do we handle player attachment to VPCs without overshadowing PC agency?

The **advancement system** in Chapter 19, while flexible, leaves me wanting more concrete pacing benchmarks. "Milestone-based advancement" and "session-based advancement" are presented as options, but specific recommendations for different campaign lengths would help newer GMs calibrate expectations.

### Collaborative Storyteller's Paradise

The emphasis on shared creation throughout this book aligns perfectly with my GM philosophy. Player-authored Tags, rotating spotlight questions, and the explicit invitation to have players describe details--this is collaborative storytelling infrastructure built into the rules.

Chapter 13's guidance on spotlight sharing and session zero expectations should be required reading for all GMs. The safety tools section is handled with appropriate seriousness without becoming preachy.

## Issue Annotations

### Issue 1: Combat Tactical Depth

**Section:** Chapter 10: Combat Basics
**Issue:** Limited guidance on complex tactical scenarios
**Impact:** GMs running combat-heavy campaigns may need to extrapolate significantly from the base principles. The four-action framework is clear, but multi-phase encounters, large-scale battles, or terrain-heavy combats lack worked examples.
**Location:** Combat Basics chapter, throughout

### Issue 2: VPC Lifecycle Management

**Section:** Chapter 24: NPCs, VPCs, and Enemies
**Issue:** Unclear criteria for NPC-to-VPC promotion
**Impact:** GMs may struggle to determine when a recurring helpful NPC should be formalized as a VPC, potentially leading to inconsistent treatment of important companions. Players may also have unclear expectations about which NPCs are "permanent."
**Location:** VPC Roles and Spotlight subsection

### Issue 3: Advancement Pacing Benchmarks

**Section:** Chapter 19: Advancement and Long Term Growth
**Issue:** Missing specific pacing recommendations for different campaign lengths
**Impact:** First-time GMs using this system may over- or under-award advancement, leading to characters who feel stagnant or overpowered for their narrative arc. The flexibility is good for experienced GMs but may confuse newcomers.
**Location:** Milestones, Arcs, and Growth subsection

### Issue 4: Chapter 1 Formatting Anomaly

**Section:** Chapter 1: Welcome to the Game
**Issue:** Table of Contents shows "welcome-to-the-game" in kebab-case instead of proper title formatting
**Impact:** Minor presentation inconsistency that could confuse readers navigating the HTML version. Breaks pattern established by other chapter titles.
**Location:** Table of Contents / Navigation sidebar

## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is an exceptional piece of game design that speaks directly to the experienced, genre-hopping, collaborative GM. Its fiction-first philosophy is articulated with clarity and backed by practical tools. The interconnected system of Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks creates a flexible framework that can handle virtually any narrative situation.

For Forever GMs like me, this book is both validation of practices we have developed over years and a source of new tools to add to our repertoire. The GM guidance chapters are particularly valuable--not because they tell us things we do not know, but because they articulate those things with precision and give us language to share with our tables.

The minor issues I have noted are exactly that: minor. They reflect a system that prioritizes flexibility and abstraction, which occasionally comes at the cost of concrete guidance for specific scenarios. Experienced GMs will fill these gaps intuitively; newer GMs may need supplementary examples.

I would recommend this book enthusiastically to:
- GMs who have grown tired of rules-heavy systems and want fiction-first play
- Tables that value collaborative storytelling over competitive challenge
- Groups who play across multiple genres and want a portable system
- GMs who enjoy understanding how game systems interconnect and why they work

**Final Rating: 8.5/10** - A strong, thoughtful system that will immediately become part of my GM toolkit.
