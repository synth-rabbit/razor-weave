## Narrative Feedback

When I crack open a rulebook, I'm looking for permission - permission to disappear into a character, to find the emotional truth beneath the dice rolls, to discover who someone becomes when the world presses against them. Razorweave understands this hunger in ways that genuinely surprised me.

The "Fiction First" philosophy isn't just a tagline here - it's woven into the DNA of how the book teaches you to play. When the text says "The story is always the starting point. You begin by understanding the situation, describing what the characters do, and only then reaching for rules if the outcome is uncertain and meaningful," I felt something click. This is how I've always wanted to play, but rarely found systems that structurally support.

The character creation chapter speaks my language. The emphasis on concept as "the foundation for every choice you make later" - that's exactly right. The examples of strong concepts like "retired scout with a guilty conscience" versus weak concepts like "fighter" show the authors understand that characters are people, not stat blocks. The identity elements section (mannerisms, first impressions, formative experiences) gives me the scaffolding I need to inhabit a character rather than merely operate one.

I was particularly moved by the Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads framework in Step Eight. The example of Rella's "drive to avoid causing harm through her work" and her unresolved pattern mystery - these aren't mechanical add-ons. They're emotional entry points, the kind of internal tensions that make a character feel alive at 2 AM when you're lying awake thinking about what they would actually do in that moment.

The relationship mechanics resonate deeply. Rella and Isten's unresolved argument about "unsafe repair methods" - that single sentence contains an entire arc waiting to unfold. The book understands that characters aren't islands floating through plot points; they're defined by their connections, their debts, their unfinished business with other people.

The Conditions system shows promise for emotional play. Conditions like "Frightened" and "Exhausted" aren't just mechanical penalties - they're invitations to portray internal states. When the text says "Frightened - Burden on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when you rally, escape, or defeat the source," I can already feel how to play that: the catch in the voice, the averted eyes, the moment of choosing to face the fear anyway.

However, I have reservations. The emotional vocabulary feels incomplete. The Conditions list focuses heavily on physical and situational states - Bleeding, Restrained, Dazed - but where are the complex emotional states? Where's Guilty, Conflicted, Grief-Stricken, Haunted? Method actors need mechanical hooks for psychological territory, not just physical consequences.

The combat chapter, while mechanically elegant, feels like a tonal shift. The emphasis on Resolve Clocks and tactical actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up) pulls focus toward board-game thinking when I'd rather stay in the character's emotional experience of violence. The system handles "what happens" well but doesn't guide "how does this feel to the person doing it."

The book is heavily GM-centric in places. As a non-GM player, I sometimes feel like a passenger when reading the extensive GM Guidance sections. I want more tools for driving my character's internal arc without requiring the GM to feed me prompts.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Conditions System - Emotional Gaps

**Issue:** The Conditions list emphasizes physical and situational states but lacks rich psychological conditions

**Impact:** Method actors struggle to mechanically represent complex emotional states like guilt, grief, conflicted loyalty, or moral crisis

**Location:** Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks - What Conditions Do

### 2. Character Creation - Internal Life Scaffolding

**Issue:** Identity elements focus on external presentation (mannerisms, first impressions) more than internal psychological landscape

**Impact:** Players oriented toward deep character immersion lack explicit guidance for developing rich inner lives

**Location:** Chapter 6: Step Two - Define Core Identity Elements

### 3. Combat Chapter - Emotional Texture

**Issue:** Combat mechanics prioritize tactical positioning over emotional experience of violence

**Impact:** Method actors may find it difficult to maintain character immersion during structured combat scenes

**Location:** Chapter 10: Combat Basics - Core Combat Actions

### 4. Personal Threads - Mechanical Integration

**Issue:** Personal Threads are introduced narratively but lack clear mechanical triggers or resolution frameworks

**Impact:** Emotional storylines may feel disconnected from dice-based play without explicit integration points

**Location:** Chapter 6: Step Eight - Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads

### 5. Player Agency in Emotional Arcs

**Issue:** Much guidance for emotional and relationship content appears in GM sections rather than player-facing content

**Impact:** Players seeking to drive their own character's psychological development receive less direct support

**Location:** Throughout GM Guidance sections in Chapters 7, 9, and 10

## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a system that genuinely respects what characters mean to the people who play them. The fiction-first philosophy creates real space for the kind of embodied, emotionally present roleplay that method actors crave. The character creation flow - from concept through identity elements to goals and threads - acknowledges that a character is a whole person with history, relationships, and unfinished emotional business.

For someone with my experience level and approach, this book delivers strong foundations while leaving me hungry for more psychological depth. The 8/10 Persona Fit reflects genuine alignment with my values: this is a system written by people who understand that the most memorable moments in roleplay aren't about critical hits but about a character making a choice that costs them something they care about.

The gaps I've identified - the emotional vocabulary of Conditions, the mechanical integration of Personal Threads, the player-side tools for driving psychological arcs - are gaps I can work with. I'll develop my own techniques for tracking emotional states, propose custom Conditions to my group, and advocate for scenes that center internal conflict. The foundation supports this work.

What I cannot easily fix is a system that doesn't believe characters are people. Razorweave believes it. That belief runs through every chapter, from the opening philosophy through the character creation scaffolding to the explicit statement that "failure creates momentum." This is a system where a partial success that costs something matters more than a clean victory that doesn't.

I can lose myself in a character playing Razorweave. That's the highest compliment I know how to give.
