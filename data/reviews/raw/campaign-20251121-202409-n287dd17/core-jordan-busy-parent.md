## Narrative Feedback

Look, I've got maybe two hours a week to prep for game night after the kids are in bed. So when I cracked open this Razorweave Core Rulebook, my first thought was: "Oh no, this is a lot."

**The Good Stuff:**

The "fiction first" approach is actually perfect for someone like me. I don't need to memorize a thousand rules because the book explicitly says to describe what happens naturally and only reach for dice when things get uncertain. That's a huge relief when I'm running on three hours of sleep and can't remember where I put my coffee.

The core resolution system - roll 4d6, add your Attribute, compare to a DC ladder - is clean and easy to remember. The DC ladder from Easy (12) to Legendary (22) makes sense, and the outcome tiers (Critical Success, Full Success, Partial Success, Failure, Critical Failure) based on margin are logical. Once I got that down, I felt like I could handle most situations.

The examples throughout are genuinely helpful. Every major concept has a boxed example showing exactly how it plays out. When I was trying to understand how Conditions work, seeing the "From Event to Condition" example about the twisted knee made it click immediately.

The Table of Contents sidebar navigation in the HTML version is a lifesaver for jumping to specific chapters during play. I can keep that visible and find rules quickly.

**Where It Gets Tough:**

This book has 30 chapters. Thirty. As a busy parent, I cannot commit to reading a 30-chapter rulebook cover to cover. I wish there was a "Start Here" one-pager that gave me just enough to run my first session.

Character creation in Chapter 6 has NINE steps. I love that the system is thorough, but when I'm trying to help four friends make characters during our limited session zero, nine steps feels like a lot. The example character Rella is helpful, but I really wanted pre-generated characters I could just hand out and say "pick one."

The Clocks and Conditions system replacing traditional hit points is clever - I genuinely appreciate the design thinking here. But it took me multiple reads to fully understand how Resolve Clocks work in combat. I'm a visual learner, and a simple flowchart showing "Player attacks -> Roll Check -> Tick Clock -> Check if full" would have helped so much.

Chapter 10 on Combat Basics explains Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, and Defend/Withdraw actions well, but when I'm in the middle of running a fight with three impatient friends and my spouse checking how long until we're done, I need something quicker to reference than prose paragraphs.

The Skills and Proficiencies chapters (14-17) are comprehensive but overwhelming. There are detailed entries for things like "Harbor Operations" and "Caravan Logistics" that are fascinating world-building but feel like a lot to absorb when I just want to know if my character can pick a lock.

**My Strategy:**

I've decided to lean hard into the fiction-first philosophy. If I don't know a specific rule, I'll make a reasonable call and look it up later. The system seems forgiving enough that improv decisions won't break anything.

I'm keeping Chapters 8 (Actions, Checks, and Outcomes) and 9 (Tags, Conditions, and Clocks) bookmarked as my main reference. Everything else I'll learn as situations come up.

For other busy parents: read Chapters 1-5 for the philosophy, skim Chapter 6 for character creation, learn the core Check procedure from Chapter 8, and then just play. You'll figure out the rest through actual gaming, which is honestly more fun than reading anyway.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation - Lengthy Process

**Issue:** Nine-step character creation is thorough but time-consuming for constrained sessions

**Impact:** Parents and casual groups may not complete character creation in a single sitting, potentially delaying actual play by a week or more

**Location:** Chapter 6, "The Creation Flow" section - Steps One through Nine

**Severity:** Medium

### 2. Chapter 10: Combat Basics - Visual Reference Gap

**Issue:** The Resolve Clock combat system lacks a visual quick-reference diagram

**Impact:** GMs running their first combat must mentally translate prose into procedure, slowing down the already complex task of managing a fight scene

**Location:** Chapter 10, "Resolve Instead of Hit Points" and "Putting It Together" sections

**Severity:** Medium

### 3. Book Structure - No Quick-Start Guide

**Issue:** No condensed quick-start summary in the front matter for time-limited readers

**Impact:** Busy readers face the prospect of navigating 30 chapters without a clear priority guide for what's essential vs. supplementary

**Location:** Part I: Foundations - absent quick-start section

**Severity:** High (for this persona)

### 4. Book Structure - No Pre-Generated Characters

**Issue:** No ready-to-play character templates or pre-generated characters provided

**Impact:** Groups cannot jump into play immediately; even with the worked Rella example, creating characters from scratch requires significant time investment

**Location:** Throughout Character Creation and Appendix materials

**Severity:** Medium

### 5. Chapter 14-17: Skills and Proficiencies - Information Density

**Issue:** Skills and Proficiencies reference chapters are extremely detailed but overwhelming for quick lookup

**Impact:** Looking up whether a specific action is covered requires reading extensive prose entries rather than scanning a simple list

**Location:** Chapters 14-17, all Skills and Proficiencies reference tables and entries

**Severity:** Low (deferred reference material)

### 6. Chapter 8: Edge/Burden System - Complexity

**Issue:** The Edge/Burden system (roll extra dice, keep best/worst 4) adds decision complexity during play

**Impact:** While elegant on paper, remembering to add/remove dice and track multiple modifiers can slow down resolution when combined with Tags and Conditions

**Location:** Chapter 8, "Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions" section

**Severity:** Low (becomes intuitive with practice)

## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is clearly a well-designed, thoughtfully constructed TTRPG system. The fiction-first philosophy, the unified 4d6 resolution mechanic, and the Tags/Conditions/Clocks framework are all elegant and well-integrated. When I can actually sit down and read it properly, I find myself nodding along and appreciating the design choices.

But I'm a busy parent. I don't have the luxury of dedicated study time. What I need is a system I can pick up quickly, reference easily during play, and run confidently even when I'm distracted by real-life interruptions.

Razorweave in its current form asks for more investment than I can easily give. The rules themselves are solid - accuracy is high and internal consistency is good. But the accessibility for time-constrained players is where it falls short.

**What would make this a 9/10 for me:**
- A 3-5 page Quick Start guide at the very front
- 4-6 pre-generated characters ready for immediate play
- A visual combat flowchart reference card
- A one-page "Rules on a Business Card" summary

As it stands, I'll make it work by relying on fiction-first improvisation and learning incrementally. The system is forgiving enough to support that approach. But I can't help feeling like this book was written for people with more reading time than I have.

**Bottom line:** Good game, needs a busy-person mode.
