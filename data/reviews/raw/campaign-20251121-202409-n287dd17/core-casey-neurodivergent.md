## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so I spent a lot of time with this rulebook and I have thoughts. The core mechanics are actually really elegant once you see the pattern - it is 4d6, compare to DC, read the margin, get your outcome tier. I can hold that in my head. That is a clean, repeatable loop and I appreciate that a lot.

What works for me: The DC ladder is concrete (12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22) and the outcome tiers have clear margin boundaries. Critical Success at +5 or more, Full Success at 0 or better, Partial at -1 to -2, Failure at -3 or worse, Critical Failure at -7 or all 1s. That is a pattern I can memorize and apply. I also really like how Advantage and Disadvantage work with extra dice rather than flat modifiers - roll 5d6 or 6d6 and keep best/worst 4. That is visual and tactile, which helps me track what is happening.

The Clocks are probably my favorite part of the whole system. They are visual progress trackers that I can literally see filling up. I understand exactly what "tick 2 segments on a 6-segment Clock" means. It is concrete. It is visible. I can draw it on paper and point to it during play.

Where I struggle: The book uses a lot of abstract language about "fiction first" and "letting the narrative guide you." I understand the principle intellectually, but when I am at the table trying to figure out when exactly to call for a Check, I need clearer decision trees. The three conditions (Uncertainty, Consequence, Agency) are helpful, but I would benefit from more worked examples showing edge cases where it is not obvious whether to roll.

The Skills and Proficiencies being open-ended custom lists is both good and overwhelming. I appreciate the flexibility for my pattern-seeking brain to build exactly what fits, but I also wish there were more complete reference lists I could just pick from. The examples scattered through the text help, but I had to hunt for them.

The chapter on Tags, Conditions, and Clocks is dense with good information but the structure is not as scannable as I need. I want tables. I want quick-reference boxes. The prose explanations are thorough but when I am mid-session and need to remember what Exhausted does, I do not want to re-read paragraphs.

One thing that really bothers me: the book says to check Chapter 18 for extended Tags and Conditions references multiple times, but Chapter 18 content was not included in what I reviewed. That broken reference is exactly the kind of thing that makes me anxious about whether I have all the information I need.

The Character Creation chapter has a clear numbered flow which I appreciated. Nine steps, laid out in order. That is the kind of structure I can follow. But some steps blend narrative and mechanical concerns in ways that feel slippery to me - I want the mechanical bits separated more clearly from the "talk to your table" bits.

Combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) are a clean four-option structure. I can hold four things. But the explanation of when to use which one relies heavily on fictional positioning that I find hard to evaluate in the moment. More concrete examples of "if X situation, consider Y action" would help me a lot.

Overall, this is a well-designed system with elegant underlying math, but the presentation prioritizes flowing prose over structured reference. For someone like me who thinks in patterns and needs visual anchors, the book asks me to do a lot of translation work to extract the mechanical frameworks from the narrative text.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Tags and Conditions Reference

**Issue:** The book repeatedly references Chapter 18 for extended Tags and Conditions but provides no summary tables in earlier chapters where these concepts are introduced.

**Impact:** During play, I would need to flip between multiple chapters to understand what a Condition does. This breaks my flow and increases cognitive load.

**Location:** Chapter 9 (Tags, Conditions, and Clocks) - throughout the prose explanations

### 2. Fiction-First Decision Framework

**Issue:** The guidance for when to call for Checks relies on three abstract criteria (Uncertainty, Consequence, Agency) but provides limited worked examples of edge cases.

**Impact:** As a pattern-driven thinker, I struggle to generalize from principles. I need more concrete "if this, then that" decision trees or tables showing when rolling is appropriate vs when to narrate through.

**Location:** Chapter 8 (Actions, Checks, and Outcomes) - "When to Roll (and When Not To)" section

### 3. Open-Ended Skill Lists

**Issue:** Skills and Proficiencies are designed as open custom lists with examples scattered across chapters rather than consolidated reference tables.

**Impact:** Character creation becomes overwhelming because I need to hunt through prose to find example Skills that might fit my concept. A master list with categories would reduce this cognitive burden.

**Location:** Chapters 14-17 (Skills and Proficiencies System) - dispersed throughout

### 4. Combat Action Selection

**Issue:** The four core combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) lack a decision matrix or flowchart for when each is optimal.

**Impact:** During combat, I analyze options by pattern-matching to previous situations. Without clear guidance on "use Set Up when X," I spend extra mental energy on decision-making that feels uncertain.

**Location:** Chapter 10 (Combat Basics) - Core Combat Actions section

### 5. Visual Reference Sheets Mentioned But Not Present

**Issue:** The book references printable sheets and templates in source/codex/sheets/ but these are not embedded in the main text.

**Impact:** I cannot evaluate whether the reference materials would address my need for scannable, visual summaries without accessing separate files.

**Location:** Chapter 27 (Sheets and Play Aids) - references to external templates

### 6. Advantage/Disadvantage Stacking Rules

**Issue:** The rules for how multiple sources of Advantage and Disadvantage combine are explained in prose but would benefit from a clear worked example showing the cancellation math.

**Impact:** When I have +2 Advantage from two sources and -1 Disadvantage from a Condition, I need to trust my mental math. A quick reference table would let me verify.

**Location:** Chapter 8 - Advantage, Disadvantage, Tags, and Conditions section

## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook has a solid mechanical foundation that appeals to my pattern-driven thinking. The 4d6 resolution system, margin-based outcome tiers, and visual Clock mechanics are all well-designed and internally consistent. I can see the elegant math underneath and I appreciate it.

However, the presentation philosophy of "fiction first" extends into how the rules are explained, which creates friction for my cognitive style. I process information better through tables, flowcharts, numbered lists, and clear decision trees than through flowing prose that asks me to internalize principles and then apply them flexibly.

As someone with 1-3 years of TTRPG experience who is curious about trying new things but wary of abstract systems, I feel like this book is about 60% there for me. The underlying system is approachable and learnable. But I would need to create my own reference sheets, extraction summaries, and decision aids to use it comfortably at the table.

My recommendation for the authors: Consider adding quick-reference sidebars or appendix pages that present the mechanical frameworks in scannable format - DC ladder table, outcome tier chart, Tag/Condition quick-lookup, combat action selection guide. The information is in the book; it just needs alternative presentation formats for neurodivergent readers who process structured information differently than narrative prose.

For players like me, this book is usable but requires significant prep work to become comfortable. I would rate it as "intriguing but demanding" rather than "pick up and play."
