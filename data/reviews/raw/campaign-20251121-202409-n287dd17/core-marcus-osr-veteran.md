## Narrative Feedback

Look, I've been running OSR games since the retro-clone explosion. I've seen systems come and go, watched the rise of "fiction-first" as the new buzzword, and I've got a pretty clear idea of what I need from a rulebook. After reading through Razorweave, I have... thoughts.

The system has some genuinely clever mechanical bones. The 4d6 core with Edge/Burden modifying dice kept (5d6 or 6d6, keep best/worst 4) is mathematically elegant. The probability curve is smooth, the variance is manageable, and having concrete DC targets (12/14/16/18/20/22) gives me anchor points I can actually use. That's good design. When a player asks "what are my odds?", I can give them a real answer.

But here's where I start to get skeptical. The book repeatedly invokes "fiction-first" as gospel, yet when I dig into the actual resolution procedure, it's... a dice roll with modifiers against a target number. That's not fiction-first. That's traditional task resolution dressed up in narrative terminology. The system tells me to describe intent and approach before rolling, but that's what I've been doing since B/X. The difference is the book spends multiple chapters philosophizing about it rather than just getting to the point.

The Clocks mechanic is stolen wholesale from Blades in the Dark, which is fine - good ideas deserve to spread. But Razorweave never really commits to what Clocks are *for* in its own context. Are they pacing tools? Progress trackers? Threat escalation? The book says "all of the above" and that's the kind of wishy-washy answer that leaves me filling in gaps at the table.

The Edge/Burden system is solid, but I found myself wanting a concrete list of "X condition grants Y modifier." The book keeps telling me to determine modifiers based on the fiction, but after 15 years of running games, I know that leads to table variance and arguments. Give me a reference table. Tell me Dim Light is -1 Burden to ranged attacks, period. Don't make me adjudicate it fresh every time.

Character creation is where my frustration peaked. The Skill and Proficiency systems are explicitly "open-ended" with players encouraged to define their own. In theory, that's flexible. In practice, I've seen what happens when players get to name their own abilities - you get "Master of All Trades" and "Impossibly Lucky" and suddenly I'm the bad guy for saying no. The book provides examples but not constraints, and constraints are what make character building interesting.

The lack of hit points in favor of Resolve Clocks and Conditions is an interesting choice, but the book is vague on actual threat calibration. How many segments should a Resolve Clock have for a starting character? For a tough VPC? It says "2-3 for quick threats, more for major foes" but that's not a baseline I can use to prep balanced encounters. I need numbers, not vibes.

What I will credit: the GM section on NPCs and VPCs is actually useful. The idea of giving important characters "Tags" that mechanically influence scenes rather than full stat blocks is efficient. And the Fronts/Factions system for campaign play shows the designers understand procedural generation and world simulation. That's OSR DNA showing through the narrative veneer.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Undefined Skill/Proficiency Constraints

**Issue:** No mechanical limits on custom Skills/Proficiencies

**Impact:** Players can define overly broad or powerful abilities without clear guidelines for scope. The book says to "collaborate with the GM" but provides insufficient boundaries for that conversation, leading to potential balance issues and table arguments.

**Location:** Chapter 6 - Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies; Chapters 14-17

### 2. Vague Threat Calibration

**Issue:** No concrete guidelines for Resolve Clock sizing or enemy difficulty

**Impact:** GMs must guess at appropriate threat levels. The statement "2-3 segments for quick threats" doesn't translate to "what's appropriate for 4 starting PCs vs 1 experienced enemy." Without a baseline difficulty calibration, encounter prep becomes trial-and-error.

**Location:** Chapter 10 - Combat Basics, Resolve Instead of Hit Points

### 3. Tag/Condition Modifier Ambiguity

**Issue:** No standardized modifier values for common Tags/Conditions

**Impact:** While Chapter 18 provides an extended reference, Tags lack consistent mechanical effects. "Dim Light" might be Burden in one scene and just narrative flavor in another. This creates inconsistent rulings and player confusion about what matters mechanically.

**Location:** Chapter 9 - What Tags Do; Chapter 18 - Extended Tags and Conditions Reference

### 4. Outcome Tier Thresholds

**Issue:** Partial Success range (-1 to -2) is very narrow

**Impact:** The jump from Partial Success to Failure is only 1 point of margin. With 4d6 variance, this means outcomes feel random rather than skill-differentiated. A trained character and an untrained one both frequently land in Partial Success territory, diminishing the mechanical value of expertise.

**Location:** Chapter 8 - Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

### 5. "Fiction-First" Inconsistency

**Issue:** System claims fiction-first but uses traditional task resolution

**Impact:** The text philosophizes extensively about narrative priority, but the actual procedure (state intent, roll 4d6+mods vs DC, interpret outcome tier) is standard task resolution found in any d20/d100 game. This mismatch between stated design goals and actual mechanics creates confusion about how the game is "supposed" to be played.

**Location:** Chapter 4 - Core Principles of Play; Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

### 6. Missing DC Guidance for Common Actions

**Issue:** DC ladder provided but application guidance is sparse

**Impact:** The DC 12-22 ladder exists, but the book doesn't provide worked examples for common situations. What DC is picking a standard lock? Climbing a rope? Persuading a neutral NPC? The answer is always "depends on fiction" which doesn't help me prep sessions efficiently.

**Location:** Chapter 8 - Setting DCs


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a competently designed mid-weight system that wraps traditional mechanics in narrative language. For GMs who want the *aesthetic* of fiction-first play with the *reliability* of concrete resolution, it may hit a sweet spot. The core dice mechanics are mathematically sound, and the Clocks/Tags/Conditions framework provides useful vocabulary for tracking game state.

However, for someone like me who values concrete procedures, reference tables, and clear constraints, Razorweave frustrates more than it enables. The open-ended character creation invites power creep. The vague threat calibration makes encounter prep unreliable. The repeated appeals to "table conversation" and "fictional positioning" feel like the book passing the hard design work to individual GMs.

I could run this game - I've run worse. But I'd spend significant prep time creating the reference tables and constraint systems the book should have included. For OSR veterans who appreciate emergent play from procedural frameworks, look elsewhere. For GMs who want a narrative-adjacent system that still uses dice, Razorweave might work, but bring your own guardrails.

Score: 6/10 - Solid mechanics undermined by philosophical hand-waving and insufficient reference material. The bones are there; the meat isn't.
