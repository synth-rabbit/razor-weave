## Narrative Feedback

Let me be direct: I came into Razorweave skeptical. "Fiction first" systems often translate to "make it up as you go," which leaves tactical players like me without the concrete frameworks we need to make informed decisions. However, this rulebook surprised me with its structural discipline, even if it has some gaps that need addressing.

The core resolution system is mathematically sound. Rolling 4d6 (averaging 14) against a DC ladder from 12 to 22 creates a probability curve I can work with. The margin system for outcome tiers is elegant: Critical Success at +5, Full Success at 0+, Partial Success at -1 to -2, Failure at -3 or below, Critical Failure at -7 or all 1s. These are concrete numbers I can plan around. When I know the DC is 16 and my modifier is +2, I can calculate my expected outcome distribution. That is exactly what I need.

The Edge and Burden system is clean. +1 Edge means roll 5d6 keep best 4; +2 Edge means roll 6d6 keep best 4. Burden inverts this. The cap at plus or minus 2 and the cancellation rules are sensible design that prevents runaway stacking. I appreciate that the system acknowledges that multiple small advantages should not create infinite bonuses.

The DC ladder is well-defined: Easy 12, Routine 14, Tough 16, Hard 18, Heroic 20, Legendary 22. This gives me benchmarks to work with and argue for during play. When the GM says "Hard," I know we are talking DC 18. That specificity matters.

The attribute spread (one at 2, two at 1, one at 0) is balanced and creates meaningful differentiation. The four-attribute model (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) is appropriately comprehensive without being bloated.

Where the system loses me is in its open-ended Skill and Proficiency design. The rulebook explicitly states that players define custom Skills and Proficiencies collaboratively with the GM. While this flexibility has merits, it creates table variance that makes it difficult to optimize character builds or predict how different GMs will rule on scope. I prefer systems where I can read a Skill description and know exactly what it covers without negotiation.

The combat system replacing hit points with Resolve Clocks is an interesting design choice. Conceptually, I understand the narrative benefits. Practically, I find myself wanting clearer guidelines on how many segments a Strike advances. The text says "Full Success significantly advances their Resolve," but what does "significantly" mean? Two segments? Three? The example suggests 2 segments for Full Success and 1 for Partial, but this is buried in an example rather than stated as a rule. That kind of ambiguity frustrates me.

Similarly, the guidance on when to call for Checks is philosophically sound but mechanically vague. "Uncertainty, consequence, and agency" are good principles, but I want clearer triggers. The system would benefit from explicit lists of actions that always require Checks versus actions that never do.

The Tags and Conditions system is well-structured. Having a shared vocabulary for environmental and character states that directly map to Edge, Burden, or DC modifications is exactly the kind of systematization I appreciate. The examples are concrete and useful.

The Clock system borrowed from Blades in the Dark is an excellent addition. Visual progress tracking with defined segment counts (4, 6, or 8) gives me something concrete to strategize around. Opposing Clocks for races and countdowns create clear tactical situations.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Skill and Proficiency Scope Ambiguity

**Issue:** Open-ended Skill and Proficiency definitions create table variance

**Impact:** Without standardized Skill lists, character optimization becomes table-dependent. A Skill that is broad at one table might be narrow at another. This makes it difficult to build characters with predictable capabilities or to discuss builds with other players.

**Location:** Chapter 6 - Character Creation, Steps Four and Five; Chapter 14 - Skills and Proficiencies Overview

### 2. Resolve Clock Advancement Rates Unclear

**Issue:** No explicit rule for how many Clock segments actions advance

**Impact:** Combat pacing becomes unpredictable without clear guidelines. The example mentions 2 segments for Full Success and 1 for Partial, but this is not codified as a rule. Different GMs will pace identical fights very differently.

**Location:** Chapter 10 - Combat Basics, Resolve Instead of Hit Points section

### 3. When to Roll Criteria Needs Concrete Examples

**Issue:** "Uncertainty, consequence, and agency" is conceptually clear but practically ambiguous

**Impact:** Different GMs will have different thresholds for calling Checks, making consistent tactical planning difficult. A comprehensive list of common actions categorized by "always rolls," "sometimes rolls," and "never rolls" would be valuable.

**Location:** Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes, When to Roll section

### 4. Attribute Selection for Actions

**Issue:** Same action can use different Attributes based on approach

**Impact:** While this is presented as flexibility, it means the optimal Attribute for any given action is subject to GM interpretation rather than rules. This makes character builds less predictable. The stuck hatch example shows four different Attributes could apply to the same goal.

**Location:** Chapter 7 - Characters and Attributes, Attributes, Intent, and Approach section

### 5. Missing Standardized Action Economy in Combat

**Issue:** Turn structure is loosely defined

**Impact:** "One main action" and "small alongside actions" at GM discretion creates inconsistency. I want to know exactly what I can do on my turn without negotiating.

**Location:** Chapter 10 - Combat Basics, Your Turn: Structure and Options section


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a mechanically coherent system that genuinely surprised me with its structural rigor despite its "fiction first" philosophy. The 4d6 resolution, DC ladder, Edge/Burden mechanics, and Clock systems are all well-designed and give tactical players concrete frameworks to work with.

However, the system shows its narrative roots in areas where I need more specificity. The open-ended Skill/Proficiency design, the ambiguous Resolve advancement rates, and the flexible action economy all create table variance that undermines consistent tactical planning. These are not fatal flaws, but they represent areas where the design prioritizes GM authority and narrative flexibility over mechanical predictability.

For a rules lawyer like me, Razorweave is a qualified recommendation. The core math is solid and the outcome tiers are well-defined. If you have a GM who will commit to consistent rulings and codify house rules for the ambiguous areas, this system can support tactical play effectively. If you prefer systems where the rulebook itself provides definitive answers to mechanical questions, you may find yourself frustrated by the collaborative nature of Skill definitions and the GM-dependent pacing of combat.

Score: 7.5/10 - A mechanically sound foundation with enough concrete numbers to support tactical play, held back by areas of designed ambiguity that require table-level codification to achieve consistency.
