## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been playing for a couple years now and really enjoys the tactical side of combat - figuring out the best moves, optimizing my character to win fights - this rulebook has some things I appreciate and some areas where I feel a bit lost.

The core mechanics are solid. I like the 4d6 system with Advantage/Disadvantage - it's clean and I can quickly calculate my odds. The DC ladder from 12 to 22 makes sense, and the margin-based outcomes (Critical, Full, Partial, Failure) are straightforward. That's the kind of structure I need to plan my turns effectively.

But here's my concern: where's the crunch? The combat chapter talks about Resolve Clocks instead of hit points, and while I understand the reasoning, I'm left wondering exactly how much damage my Strike does. Does a Full Success tick 2 segments? 1? It depends on the GM apparently. For someone who likes to optimize and plan, this ambiguity is frustrating.

The Set Up and Maneuver actions are interesting tactically - I can see how creating Advantage for allies before a big Strike could be powerful. But again, the actual mechanical effects feel fuzzy. How long does that Advantage last? Until the end of combat? One turn? It's not always clear.

I'm trying to embrace the 'fiction-first' approach the book emphasizes, and I can see how it makes for good stories. But part of me keeps wanting hard numbers and precise rules. The Tags and Conditions system is flexible, but sometimes I just want to know exactly what Bleeding does in terms of penalties, not have it negotiated at the table every time.

The proficiencies and skills sections are well-organized. I appreciate having clear lists of what each attribute covers. That helps me plan character builds.

Overall, I think I could run a good combat-focused game with this system, but I'd need to do more work at the table to establish consistent rulings. The GM section has good advice for collaborative play, which matches what my group does, but I'd want a GM who's willing to establish some house rules for the mechanical edges the book leaves soft.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock tick rates are not specified

**Impact:** Players cannot plan optimal strategies without knowing how much progress different actions make

**Location:** Section on Resolve Instead of Hit Points

### 2. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Duration of Set Up advantages unclear

**Impact:** Tactical planning is hindered when buff/debuff durations are ambiguous

**Location:** Core Combat Actions - Set Up subsection

### 3. Chapter 18 - Extended Tags and Conditions Reference

**Issue:** Condition mechanical effects vary by GM interpretation

**Impact:** Killer archetype players need consistent rules to optimize character effectiveness

**Location:** General framework description

### 4. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Advantage/Disadvantage stacking examples limited

**Impact:** Edge cases for combining multiple sources need more worked examples for tactical players

**Location:** Advantage, Disadvantage, Tags, and Conditions subsection


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a competent fiction-first system that will appeal to narrative-focused groups, but leaves tactical/optimizer players wanting more mechanical precision. The 4d6 core is elegant and the DC ladder is clear. However, the deliberate flexibility in combat outcomes - particularly around Resolve Clocks, condition effects, and action durations - creates uncertainty that makes advance planning difficult. For a Killer archetype player with 1-3 years experience who is trying to embrace more narrative play, this book represents a learning opportunity but may require significant table-level calibration to feel satisfying. Rating: Solid foundation, but needs GM collaboration to establish consistent tactical frameworks. Would benefit from an optional 'crunchier' variant for combat-focused groups.
