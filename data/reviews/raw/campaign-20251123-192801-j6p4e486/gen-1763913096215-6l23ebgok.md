## Narrative Feedback

As someone transitioning toward fiction-first play while still grounding myself in concrete mechanics, I find Razorweave to be an ambitious and thoughtful system. The book's structure flows logically from foundations through character creation to advanced GM tools, which speaks to my analytical nature.

The "Fiction First, Mechanics Second" philosophy resonates with my evolving playstyle, but I sometimes struggle when the text prioritizes narrative outcomes over explicit numerical procedures. Chapter 8 on Actions, Checks, and Outcomes provides a solid framework, but I would appreciate more concrete examples of DC setting and outcome calibration. As a Scene Framer who needs to pace encounters, having explicit guidelines for when and how to invoke specific rules would help me maintain session flow.

The character creation process in Chapter 6 strikes a good balance between narrative identity and mechanical grounding. I particularly appreciate how attributes connect to both fiction (what your character can do) and mechanics (dice pools and modifiers). However, the skill and proficiency systems in Chapters 14-17 could benefit from more explicit synergy tables showing exactly which combinations yield what bonuses.

The GM-facing content in Part III shows thoughtful design around Factions, Fronts, and World Pressure (Chapter 25). As a Scene Framer, these tools help me construct compelling sequences, but I wish there were more worked examples with specific numbers attached to clock progressions and faction actions.

Genre flexibility is a strength here - the system feels adaptable without being so abstract that I lose my mechanical footing. The Optional Rules in Chapter 20 give me knobs to turn, which I appreciate.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** DC guidelines lack concrete number ranges

**Impact:** As a GM who needs concrete numbers, I struggle to consistently set appropriate difficulty levels without explicit tier definitions

**Location:** Sections on setting target numbers and determining difficulty

### 2. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Clock advancement triggers described narratively without mechanical specifics

**Impact:** When scene framing, I need to know exactly what fiction triggers clock advancement - the current text requires too much GM interpretation

**Location:** Clock progression rules and segment advancement guidelines

### 3. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Action economy described conceptually rather than procedurally

**Impact:** Combat pacing suffers when I cannot reference a clear turn structure with defined action types and costs

**Location:** Initiative and turn order sections

### 4. Chapter 15: Skills Reference

**Issue:** Skill-attribute pairings described but not tabulated

**Impact:** Reference lookup is slow during play; a consolidated table would improve usability

**Location:** Individual skill entries

### 5. Chapter 21: Running Sessions

**Issue:** Session pacing advice is philosophically sound but lacks concrete timing benchmarks

**Impact:** As someone converting to fiction-first, I need scaffolding to know when to call for rolls versus let fiction flow

**Location:** Pacing and rhythm sections


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a compelling fiction-first system that respects the intelligence of both GMs and players. For someone like me - a Storyteller converting to narrative-heavy play while still anchoring in concrete mechanics - this book is approximately 70% of what I need to run successful sessions.

The strengths are clear: thoughtful design philosophy, logical organization, flexible genre support, and genuine attention to table collaboration. The Scene Framing tools and Fronts system give me the narrative scaffolding I crave.

However, the gap between fiction-first philosophy and practical implementation creates friction for players like me who are still developing intuition for when mechanics should intervene. The book would significantly improve with: (1) explicit DC tier tables with numerical ranges, (2) procedural flowcharts for common rule applications, (3) more worked examples showing the math behind narrative outcomes, and (4) consolidated reference tables for skills and proficiencies.

I give this an overall positive assessment with reservations. The foundation is strong, but players converting from more mechanically explicit systems will need additional scaffolding to bridge the gap. A companion "quick reference" document addressing the issues above would transform this from a good rulebook into an excellent one.
