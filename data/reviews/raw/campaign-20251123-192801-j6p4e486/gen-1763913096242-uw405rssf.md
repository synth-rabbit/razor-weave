## Narrative Feedback

As a veteran with nearly two decades at the table, I've seen countless systems come and go. Razorweave presents itself as 'fiction first,' which immediately puts me on guard—I've watched too many games use that phrase as an excuse for hand-wavy mechanics that fall apart under scrutiny.

That said, I'll give credit where it's due: the book does eventually get to concrete numbers. The 4d6 system with its margin-based outcomes (Critical Success at +5, Full Success at 0, etc.) is actually quite elegant. The DC tier system (DC 12-14 for routine, 16-18 for challenging, 20+ for heroic) gives me the hard numbers I need to build consistent worlds. The Advantage/Disadvantage system capping at +/-2 is sensible and prevents dice pool bloat.

However, I found myself frustrated by how long it takes to get to the mechanical meat. Part I spends considerable time on philosophy before delivering the concrete procedures I need. As someone who runs world simulation-style games, I want to know exactly how faction Clocks interact, what numerical thresholds trigger escalation, and how to calibrate challenge across genre shifts. Some of this is here, but it's scattered.

The Skills and Proficiencies structure appeals to my explorer sensibilities—I like systems with lots of levers to pull and corners to discover. The breakdown by Attribute (STR, AGI, PRE, RES, etc.) with specific DC ranges per Skill is useful reference material. But the Proficiency system feels underbaked: it offers 'default benefits' and 'GM usage notes' but not always hard mechanical bonuses I can bank on.

The genre-agnostic approach is ambitious. I appreciate that the same DC framework can model a cozy town mystery or a sci-fi station crisis. But the text often defers to 'the GM can adjust' rather than providing genre-specific calibration tables I could use to maintain consistent world logic across different campaign flavors.

The GM section has solid practical advice for session structure, but I wanted more tools for building deterministic world states that evolve predictably. The Fronts and Clocks system is a step in the right direction, but I would have liked explicit examples of how multiple Clocks interact mathematically—when does a 4-segment Clock outpace a 6-segment one given certain triggering frequencies?

Overall, Razorweave is a competent system with good bones. It just requires more work from me as GM to extract the concrete operational parameters I need to run my simulation-style games. The book talks a good game about 'supporting the story with mechanics,' but sometimes I felt the mechanics were being deliberately vague to preserve narrative flexibility at the expense of predictable world behavior.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Part I: Foundations

**Issue:** Philosophy-heavy introduction delays access to core mechanics

**Impact:** GMs who want to quickly understand the mathematical engine must wade through extensive fiction-first justification before reaching concrete procedures

**Location:** Chapters 1-5, approximately first 20% of the book

### 2. Proficiencies System

**Issue:** Inconsistent mechanical weight for Proficiencies

**Impact:** Some Proficiencies grant concrete DC modifiers while others offer narrative permissions only, making it difficult to predict their mechanical impact during world simulation

**Location:** Chapters 16-17, Proficiencies Reference

### 3. DC Calibration

**Issue:** Limited genre-specific DC guidance

**Impact:** While DC tiers exist (12-14, 16-18, 20+), the book lacks systematic tables for calibrating difficulty across different genre assumptions, leaving world-simulation GMs to improvise

**Location:** Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

### 4. Clocks and Fronts

**Issue:** Insufficient mathematical modeling for Clock interactions

**Impact:** The system describes Clocks qualitatively but does not provide formulas or heuristics for predicting how multiple Clocks racing against each other will resolve, which undermines deterministic world planning

**Location:** Chapters 9 and 25

### 5. Combat Basics

**Issue:** Position and advantage sources are narratively determined

**Impact:** Tags like Exposed or Solid Cover grant mechanical effects, but the criteria for when these Tags apply is left largely to table consensus rather than defined spatial or tactical rules

**Location:** Chapter 10: Combat Basics


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a mechanically sound system with a clear resolution engine (4d6 + Attribute vs DC, margin-based outcomes) and useful organizational tools (Tags, Conditions, Clocks, Fronts). For veteran GMs who prefer narrative emergence and player-driven fiction, it likely works beautifully.

For my playstyle—world simulation where I want predictable, consistent mechanical outputs—the system requires additional GM work. The fiction-first philosophy is not merely aesthetic; it permeates how mechanical elements are defined, often leaving hard boundaries to table negotiation. I can work with Razorweave, but I would need to build my own reference sheets, DC calibration tables, and Clock interaction matrices to run it the way I prefer.

The book is well-organized in concept (four parts moving from foundations through advanced GM tools), but the actual information density per page varies. Some chapters are tight and useful; others feel padded with example boxes that illustrate points already made. A veteran will skim these; a newcomer might appreciate them.

If you share my preference for crunchy world-modeling with explicit mechanical levers, approach Razorweave as a solid foundation that will require customization. If you are more comfortable with negotiated mechanical application at the table, you will likely find it an excellent fit.
