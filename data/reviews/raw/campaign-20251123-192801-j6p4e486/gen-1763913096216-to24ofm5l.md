## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's spent years on both sides of the GM screen and who thrives on tactical mastery, I approached this rulebook with a particular lens: can I win at this game, and can I run it without a dedicated GM?

The good news first: the core 4d6 resolution system is elegant and predictable once you understand the margin-based outcome tiers. I appreciate that the math is transparent - rolling 4d6 with Advantage/Disadvantage caps at +/-2 keeps things bounded. The DC ladder (12-22) gives me clear targets to optimize around.

However, I'm deeply skeptical of the "fiction first" philosophy that permeates every chapter. When the book repeatedly says "you do not start with a rule and then try to force the fiction to match it," I hear "the GM has arbitrary power over when rules apply." As a Killer archetype who wants to optimize my character's effectiveness, this uncertainty is frustrating. I need to know exactly when my Skills and Proficiencies will give me mechanical benefits, not "when the GM decides it's relevant."

The Resolve Clock system replacing hit points is a double-edged sword. I appreciate the visible progress tracking, but the lack of numerical damage values makes it harder to calculate exactly how many Strikes I need to end a fight. The book says a Full Success on Strike "significantly advances" the enemy's Resolve - but by how many segments? One? Two? This ambiguity undermines tactical planning.

Where this book genuinely excites me is the GMless and shared authority sections in Chapter 26. The rotating facilitator model, explicit procedures for distributing scene framing, and oracle tools for solo play show that the designers actually thought about alternative play modes. Most games treat GMless as an afterthought; here it gets serious treatment with practical procedures.

That said, the GMless procedures could be more explicit. The book says "agree on how you will introduce threats, decide outcomes" without providing concrete mechanical frameworks for doing so. I'd want pre-built oracle tables in the appendix, not just the suggestion that groups should make their own.

The pattern-driven part of my brain appreciates the consistent structure: Tags affect environment, Conditions affect characters, Clocks track progress. Once I internalized this three-part framework, much of the system clicked into place. But the open-ended nature of Skills and Proficiencies ("work with your GM to define custom entries") works against my desire for systematic optimization.

Overall: a solid foundation with genuine innovation in alternative play modes, undermined by excessive reliance on GM fiat and narrative abstraction that will frustrate players who prefer mechanical clarity.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Strike outcomes lack specific mechanical definitions

**Impact:** Cannot calculate expected actions needed to defeat opponents; tactical planning is guesswork

**Location:** Section on 'Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin' - outcomes reference 'advancing Resolve' without segment values

### 2. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock advancement rates undefined

**Impact:** The example shows a 6-segment Resolve Clock where Full Success ticks 2 segments and Partial ticks 1 - but this is an example, not a rule. No guidance for other clock sizes or threat levels.

**Location:** Section 'Resolve Instead of Hit Points' and 'Example - Enemy Resolve'

### 3. Chapter 6: Character Creation - Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Open-ended skill lists create optimization uncertainty

**Impact:** Without a closed list, I cannot evaluate skill coverage or identify gaps in my build. 'Work with your GM' is not a system.

**Location:** Sections 'Step Four: Choose Skills' and 'Step Five: Choose Proficiencies'

### 4. Chapter 26: Alternative Play - GMless Procedures

**Issue:** GMless procedures reference oracle tables that don't exist in the book

**Impact:** The section mentions 'Yes/No/Complication prompts' and 'small oracle tables' without providing them. Players must create their own tools.

**Location:** Section 'GMless Procedures' and 'Using Oracles and Prompts'

### 5. Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy creates mechanical uncertainty

**Impact:** Repeated emphasis on 'rules follow fiction' means I never know when my character's abilities will actually provide mechanical benefits. This is GM-dependent, not system-defined.

**Location:** Sections 'Fiction First, Mechanics Second' and throughout the chapter

### 6. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Skill bonuses not explicitly stated

**Impact:** The Check procedure mentions 'add relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills' but Skills section never defines what numerical bonus they provide. Is it +1? +2? Advantage?

**Location:** Section 'Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin'


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook presents a competent fiction-first system with genuine innovation in alternative play modes, but it will frustrate players like me who approach games with a tactical, optimization-focused mindset.

STRENGTHS:
- Clean 4d6 resolution with bounded Advantage/Disadvantage
- Consistent Tag/Condition/Clock framework creates learnable patterns
- Serious treatment of GMless and solo play modes
- Transparent DC ladder enables some tactical planning
- Genre-flexible design supports varied campaign styles

WEAKNESSES:
- Excessive reliance on GM interpretation undermines mechanical predictability
- Combat lacks the numerical specificity needed for tactical optimization
- Open-ended Skills/Proficiencies prevent systematic character building
- Oracle tools referenced but not provided
- "Fiction first" philosophy creates friction for Killer archetypes

VERDICT: 6/10 for my playstyle. The GMless support is genuinely valuable and the core resolution is solid, but the persistent ambiguity around mechanical outcomes makes this a poor fit for players who want to master the system rather than collaborate on emerging narratives. If you're running GMless or solo, add this to your consideration list. If you're a tactical optimizer who prefers clear rules, look elsewhere or be prepared to establish extensive house rules for mechanical clarity.
