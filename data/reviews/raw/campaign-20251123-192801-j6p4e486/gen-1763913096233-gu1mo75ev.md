## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been running and playing games for nearly a decade now, I appreciate a system that knows what it's trying to be. Razorweave is clearly designed for fiction-first play, and as someone who's already comfortable with that approach, the core philosophy feels natural. The 4d6 resolution system with the Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic rolling extra dice and keeping best/worst 4 is elegant and keeps the math simple while still providing meaningful differentiation.

What I find particularly well-executed is the intent and approach framework. The book is clear that you declare what you want to achieve (intent) and how you're attempting it (approach), and then the GM selects the appropriate Attribute. This prevents the "I want to roll Persuasion" problem I've seen plague other systems. The examples throughout reinforce this beautifully - the rooftop chase, the factory foreman negotiation, the telegraph investigation.

However, as a Tactician, I have some concerns about the combat system. The Resolve Clocks are an interesting abstraction, but I find myself wanting more granularity. The book says a Full Success on a Strike "significantly advances their Resolve" and might tick 2 segments, while Partial Success ticks 1 with a cost - but "significantly advances" feels vague. When I'm planning tactical engagement, I want to know: does flanking provide +1 Advantage or +2? Does elevation change damage or just hit chance?

The Set Up / Maneuver / Strike / Defend-Withdraw action framework is solid tactical design. I particularly like how Set Up explicitly creates Advantage for allies - that's the kind of cooperative combat I enjoy planning around. But the actual mechanical effects feel under-specified for my tastes. The book says good use of Set Up "can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one," but doesn't give me concrete benchmarks.

The Tags and Conditions system is where I see the most promise for tactical depth, but also where I struggle most. The book provides categories (Environmental, Situational, Atmospheric) and examples (Dim Light, Slick, Cramped), but leaves the specific mechanical effects loose. "Slick imposes Disadvantage on fast movement or acrobatic maneuvers" - but is that always -1 Disadvantage or sometimes -2? Does it stack with other environmental hazards?

As a Railroad Conductor GM, I actually appreciate that the DC ladder is clear (12-22) and the outcome tiers are well-defined. I can pre-plan my encounters knowing exactly what difficulties to set. The margin-based outcomes (Critical Success at +5, Full Success at 0, Partial at -1 to -2, Failure at -3 or worse, Critical Failure at -7 or all 1s) give me consistent results to work with.

The Clocks system is excellent for pacing. I can design scenarios with paired Clocks (Progress vs Threat) and know exactly when tension will peak. The examples of "Evacuation Complete" vs "Flood Waters Rise" and "Expose the Official" vs "Cover-Up" demonstrate exactly the kind of structured dramatic timing I prefer.

My biggest frustration is with Skills and Proficiencies. The book explicitly says they're not from a fixed list and encourages custom creation. For a fiction-first native, this is fine - I can make it work. But as someone who wants to plan tactical scenarios in advance, not knowing what capabilities players will bring makes encounter design harder. I wish there were at least benchmark examples or common skill lists per genre.

The writing itself is excellent - clear, well-organized, with useful examples throughout. The book knows when to provide detailed procedure (the Check loop, combat actions) and when to provide principles (fiction-first philosophy, failure creates momentum). Chapter summaries help me quickly reference what I need.

One thing I truly appreciate: the book is honest about what "taken out" means in combat varying by stakes. Pre-negotiating whether a fight is to kill, rout, capture, or delay is excellent practice that prevents mid-combat arguments. As someone who likes to maintain narrative control, this explicit stakes-setting is valuable.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Combat Basics - Resolve Instead of Hit Points

**Issue:** Vague language around Resolve Clock advancement ('significantly advances', 'serious pressure')

**Impact:** Difficult to plan tactical encounters or predict combat duration; GM must improvise segment counts

**Location:** Chapter 10, section 'Resolve Instead of Hit Points' and 'Strike' action

### 2. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks - What Tags Do

**Issue:** No standardized mechanical effects for common Tags; effects described in prose rather than rules

**Impact:** Inconsistent rulings between sessions; players cannot reliably predict how Tags affect their actions

**Location:** Chapter 9, sections on Tags and 'Using Tags and Conditions with Checks'

### 3. Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Open-ended Skill/Proficiency system with no benchmark lists or genre templates

**Impact:** Encounter design becomes difficult when GM cannot predict player capabilities; balance relies entirely on table consensus

**Location:** Chapter 6, section 'Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies'

### 4. Combat Basics - Set Up

**Issue:** Set Up action lacks specific duration or magnitude guidelines for created Advantages

**Impact:** Unclear whether Set Up Advantage lasts one attack, one round, or until circumstances change; tactical planning hampered

**Location:** Chapter 10, 'Set Up' subsection under Core Combat Actions

### 5. Advantage/Disadvantage System

**Issue:** Sources of Advantage/Disadvantage not enumerated; 'usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies' is non-exhaustive

**Impact:** Players and GM may disagree about when modifiers apply; requires constant negotiation rather than reference

**Location:** Chapter 8, section 'Advantage, Disadvantage, Tags, and Conditions'


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a well-designed fiction-first system that delivers on its stated goals. For an experienced player comfortable with narrative-driven games, the core mechanics are elegant and the philosophy is sound. The 4d6 + Attribute resolution, margin-based outcomes, and Clock-based tracking are all executed cleanly.

As a Tactician, I find the system provides a solid foundation but lacks the tactical granularity I prefer. The combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) offer meaningful choices, but the mechanical effects are often described in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. This works for fiction-first play but makes advance encounter planning challenging.

The book earns high marks for clarity and organization. Examples are plentiful and well-chosen. The GM guidance is practical without being prescriptive. For tables that embrace the fiction-first philosophy and trust collaborative interpretation, this system will sing.

My rating reflects that Razorweave does what it intends to do well, but my Tactician preferences and analytical approach would benefit from more mechanical specification. I could run this system effectively, but I'd need to create my own encounter benchmarks and Tag reference sheets to satisfy my planning instincts. For players who share my tactical inclinations, consider this a "learn the system, then house-rule for crunch" recommendation.

Persona fit is moderate because while fiction-first natives will be comfortable, those of us who are wary of abstraction will find some mechanics uncomfortably loose. The Railway Conductor in me appreciates the clear DC ladder and outcome tiers, but wishes for more structured encounter tools.
