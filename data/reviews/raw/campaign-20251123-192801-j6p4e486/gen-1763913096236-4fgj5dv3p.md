## Narrative Feedback

As someone just getting into tabletop RPGs, I found Razorweave both exciting and overwhelming. The "fiction first" approach sounds great in theory, but as a new player who needs concrete numbers to feel confident, I often felt like I was floating without solid ground under my feet.

The visual design is genuinely impressive - the synthwave color scheme with electric blue and hot pink headers really pops and makes the book feel modern and inviting. As a visual learner, I appreciate how the example boxes and GM guidance sections are clearly distinguished with different colored borders. The table of contents sidebar is helpful for navigation.

However, when I'm trying to figure out how powerful my character is or whether I can beat a challenge, I found myself hunting for hard numbers. The DC ladder is there in Chapter 8, but I wish there were more concrete examples showing "a character with these stats has X% chance of success against this DC." I'm coming from video games where I can see exact damage numbers and success rates - this system feels deliberately vague in comparison.

The Check system using 4d6 is interesting, but as someone converting to fiction-first play, I keep wanting more mechanical certainty. When do I KNOW I'm going to succeed versus fail? The outcome tiers (Success, Partial Success, Failure) are elegant but feel scary when I can't predict them.

What I really love is the character progression system - as an Achiever, I want to see my character grow and get tangibly better at things. The advancement chapter promises this, but I'd like more frequent milestones and clearer benchmarks. "When did I level up?" is a question I find myself asking.

The Clocks system is brilliant for visual tracking - I can actually see danger building, which works great for how my brain processes information. But Tags and Conditions feel a bit abstract until you're in the middle of play.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** DC ladder lacks concrete probability guidance

**Impact:** New players like me cannot estimate their chances of success, leading to anxiety about when to attempt risky actions

**Location:** DC tier descriptions (Routine through Legendary)

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Starting capability benchmarks are unclear

**Impact:** As an Achiever, I want to know where I stand - am I weak, average, or strong for a starting character? No frame of reference provided

**Location:** Attribute and Skill assignment sections

### 3. Chapter 2: Core Concepts at a Glance

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy assumes prior understanding

**Impact:** Converting players like me need more concrete examples of how 'fiction first' actually works in practice - the concept is explained but not demonstrated enough

**Location:** Fiction First subsection

### 4. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long Term Growth

**Issue:** Advancement triggers feel subjective

**Impact:** Achievers want clear goals - 'significant action' and 'meaningful sacrifice' are too open to interpretation for players who want concrete milestones

**Location:** Advancement trigger descriptions

### 5. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Condition mechanical effects need quick reference

**Impact:** During play, I need to know instantly what 'Shaken' or 'Wounded' DOES mechanically, but I have to read paragraphs to understand each one

**Location:** Condition descriptions throughout chapter


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is an ambitious and visually striking RPG that's clearly designed for narrative-focused play. As a newbie Achiever who needs concrete numbers, I find myself caught between appreciating the elegant design and wanting more mechanical crunch to hold onto.

The book would significantly benefit from: (1) a probability reference showing success chances for different attribute+skill combinations against common DCs, (2) a "power level" benchmark so new players understand where starting characters stand, and (3) more worked examples that show the full mechanical resolution from intent to outcome.

The Clocks system and visual design are highlights that work well for my learning style. The organization is logical and the writing is clear - I just wish there was more "math I can see" rather than "narrative I have to feel."

For fellow newbies who like concrete goals and visible progress, I'd recommend this with the caveat that you might need your GM to provide more numerical feedback than the rules strictly require. The system is sound, but the presentation prioritizes narrative elegance over mechanical transparency.

Rating: 6.25/10 overall - Good foundations, but needs more scaffolding for players like me who are still developing fiction-first instincts.
