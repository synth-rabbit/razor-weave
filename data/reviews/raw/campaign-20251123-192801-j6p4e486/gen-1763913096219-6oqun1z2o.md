## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has been running narrative-focused games for several years, I find the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a thoughtfully constructed system that aligns well with my storytelling sensibilities. The fiction-first philosophy resonates deeply with how I like to run sessions—where the story leads and mechanics serve.

The chapter structure makes logical sense, flowing from foundational concepts through character creation into the mechanical systems. I particularly appreciate how Chapter 4 on Core Principles of Play articulates values like "The Table Is a Creative Team" and "Failure Creates Momentum." These principles match my preferred approach to collaborative storytelling.

However, I notice some tension between the book's stated philosophy and certain mechanical sections. For a system emphasizing fiction-first play, the Skills and Proficiencies chapters (14-17) feel dense with mechanical options. As a Railroad Conductor GM who prefers structured narrative flow, I would benefit from clearer guidance on how to select which skills matter for a given campaign's tone.

The 4d6 resolution system is elegant but could use more worked examples showing how the outcome tiers translate into narrative beats. I found myself wanting more "if you roll this, here's how that might play out in different genres" guidance.

The safety tools section in the GM guidance is excellent—brief but effective. The collaborative tone throughout reminds me of games like Apocalypse World in its approach, though with more traditional resolution mechanics.

Overall, this rulebook gives me the tools I need while trusting me to use them wisely. It just sometimes buries those tools under too many options.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 14-15: Skills System

**Issue:** Dense mechanical reference interrupts narrative flow

**Impact:** For a Storyteller seeking fiction-first guidance, the extensive skill lists can feel overwhelming. The transition from narrative principles to detailed skill entries is jarring.

**Location:** Skills Reference chapter, particularly the table-heavy sections

### 2. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Outcome tier examples could be more narratively rich

**Impact:** The explanation of Full Success, Partial Success, and Failure is mechanically clear but light on showing how different genres would interpret the same roll. As someone who runs genre-specific games, I want more varied examples.

**Location:** Outcome tier definitions and worked examples

### 3. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Attribute allocation guidance feels sparse for new players in my groups

**Impact:** While I understand the system after reading, players I introduce to the game may struggle with the +2/+1/0/-1 distribution without more context on how attributes shape play.

**Location:** Attribute distribution section

### 4. Chapter 21-22: Running Sessions/Campaigns

**Issue:** GM section arrives late in the book

**Impact:** As a GM who wants to understand the full picture before teaching players, I had to jump around. Consider a quick GM overview earlier or a suggested reading order for GMs.

**Location:** Part III placement in book structure

### 5. Part I Foundations

**Issue:** Fiction-first terminology could be defined earlier

**Impact:** The term "fiction-first" appears frequently before being fully explained. A new reader curious about this approach might feel lost initially.

**Location:** Chapters 1-3, first mentions of fiction-first


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a solid fiction-first system that will serve experienced GMs well, particularly those who appreciate collaborative storytelling with just enough mechanical structure to resolve uncertainty. The writing is clear and the organization is logical, though the density of the Skills and Proficiencies sections may intimidate players new to narrative games.

For my playstyle as a Storyteller who prefers structured narrative arcs, this book provides good tools while trusting me to adapt them. The principles of play align with my values—especially the emphasis on failure as momentum and partial success as story beats. 

My main critique is that the book sometimes loses its own fiction-first thread in the mechanical reference sections. A "Quick Start" section or a clearer "read this first" path would help groups get to the table faster.

Rating: 7.5/10 - A capable and thoughtful rulebook that rewards careful reading and GM creativity.
