## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been playing tabletop games for a couple years now, I picked up this rulebook hoping for something that would help me run more story-focused games with my friends. The writing is generally clear and I appreciate the "fiction first" philosophy - it's something I've been trying to embrace after years of more traditional games.

The good news: I can tell the designers really thought about how to explain concepts. The examples throughout really help, especially in the early chapters. I like that the book explicitly says you don't need to memorize everything before playing. That's reassuring for someone like me who sometimes feels overwhelmed by new systems.

However, I'm struggling a bit with some sections. The book talks about "intent and approach" a lot, which makes sense conceptually, but I found myself wishing for more concrete examples of exactly what modifiers or difficulty numbers look like in practice. I'm the kind of person who needs to see the numbers before I can feel confident running a scene. Chapter 8 on Checks is helpful, but I had to re-read it a few times.

The Skills and Proficiencies chapters are dense. As someone who prefers simpler systems, having to cross-reference between Chapter 14-17 feels like a lot to manage at the table. I wish there was a quick-reference card or something more condensed.

On the positive side, the chapter on Core Principles really speaks to me as a collaborative storyteller. The emphasis on trust, player agency, and "the table is a creative team" aligns perfectly with how I want to run games. The section on failure creating momentum rather than stopping play is exactly what I needed to read.

Overall, I think this is a solid rulebook that I'll probably grow into. Right now, some parts feel a bit abstract for my taste, but I can see how the system would flow once I get more comfortable with the fiction-first approach.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, Outcomes

**Issue:** Check resolution procedure could use a clearer step-by-step breakdown with numbered steps

**Impact:** As someone still learning the system, I had to piece together the exact procedure from multiple paragraphs. A boxed summary would help during actual play.

**Location:** Sections on Checks and resolution throughout the chapter

### 2. Chapters 14-17: Skills and Proficiencies Reference

**Issue:** The reference sections are comprehensive but dense - no quick lookup format

**Impact:** During character creation or at-table reference, finding the right skill/proficiency takes longer than it should. A one-page visual summary would be invaluable.

**Location:** Full reference chapters

### 3. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Character creation steps mention referencing other chapters but the flow could be more self-contained

**Impact:** For a newer player creating their first character, the jumping between chapters disrupts the creative flow. I'd prefer more inline examples.

**Location:** Steps 4-5 (Skills and Proficiencies selection)

### 4. Chapter 3: How to Use This Rulebook

**Issue:** Good conceptual guidance but lacks concrete 'if you're this kind of player, start here' recommendations

**Impact:** As someone who prefers focused systems and simplicity, I wasn't sure which chapters to prioritize. More explicit reading paths would help.

**Location:** Navigating the Book section

### 5. Core Mechanics Throughout

**Issue:** The fiction-first approach is well-explained philosophically but specific DC/difficulty examples are sparse

**Impact:** I need concrete numbers to feel confident. More example DCs for common situations would help me internalize the system faster.

**Location:** Various chapters discussing Checks and difficulty


## Overall Assessment

This is a thoughtfully designed rulebook that clearly articulates its fiction-first philosophy. The writing quality is high and the core principles align well with collaborative storytelling. For my specific needs as an early intermediate player who's converting to fiction-first play, the book provides excellent conceptual foundation but leaves me wanting more concrete mechanical scaffolding. The dense reference chapters and need to cross-reference between sections reduce practical usability at the table. I rate it positively overall but would benefit from supplementary quick-reference materials and more explicit numeric examples. With some table experience, I expect the system will click - the design seems sound, it's just the presentation that could be more accessible for players like me who need to see the numbers alongside the narrative guidance.
