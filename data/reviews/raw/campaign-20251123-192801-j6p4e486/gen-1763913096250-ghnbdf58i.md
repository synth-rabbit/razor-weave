## Narrative Feedback

Look, I've been running games for years and I appreciate a well-organized rulebook, but this one is testing my patience in a few places. The fiction-first philosophy? Brilliant. That's exactly how I run my games - story comes first, dice come second. I love that this is baked right into the core principles.

The four-attribute system (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) is refreshingly simple and I can teach it to my casual players in about five minutes. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are elegant tools that I can see using to track everything from a tense negotiation to a burning building. That's the kind of flexibility I need when I'm improvising half of what happens at my table.

But here's where it gets frustrating for a busy GM like me: the book is DENSE. Thirty chapters? I'm running games for folks who just want to have fun on a Saturday afternoon, not earn a PhD in game mechanics. When I need to look something up mid-session, I want to find it in ten seconds, not ten minutes.

The Skills and Proficiencies references (Chapters 14-17) feel like they could have been condensed. And while I appreciate the GM section, some of those chapters blur together. Do I really need separate chapters for NPCs, Factions, and Fronts when I'm going to end up just scribbling "Scary Guy - wants money - Clock: 4 segments" on an index card anyway?

The good news is that once you internalize the core loop, everything else flows from it. The DC Ladder makes sense. The outcome tiers are clear. I just wish there was a "Busy GM's Quick Reference" at the front of the book that gave me the essentials without requiring me to flip through thirty chapters.

For my style of play - casual, story-driven, improvised - this system could work really well. But I'd need to do some prep work to distill it down to what actually matters at the table.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Book Organization

**Issue:** Too many chapters for a system marketed as flexible and accessible

**Impact:** Intimidates casual players and makes mid-session reference difficult for GMs

**Location:** Table of Contents - 30 chapters across 4 parts

### 2. Skills and Proficiencies Reference (Chapters 14-17)

**Issue:** Reference chapters are verbose for quick lookup during play

**Impact:** Slows down game flow when GM or players need to check skill applications or proficiency details

**Location:** Part II: Skills, Proficiencies, and Mechanical Reference

### 3. Sheets and Play Aids (Chapter 27)

**Issue:** Play aids are described but not immediately accessible - references to source/codex/sheets/ paths

**Impact:** Casual GMs may struggle to find and use the reference sheets that would help them most

**Location:** Chapter 27, Player-Facing Sheets and GM-Facing Sheets sections

### 4. Alternative Play (Chapter 26)

**Issue:** Solo play and GMless procedures could use more concrete examples

**Impact:** Players new to these modes may find the guidance too abstract to follow immediately

**Location:** Chapter 26, GMless Procedures and Solo Play with VPC Companions sections

### 5. Core Resolution

**Issue:** The relationship between Tags, Conditions, and DC adjustments requires cross-referencing multiple chapters

**Impact:** World Simulator GMs who want consistent rulings need to flip between chapters 8, 9, and 18

**Location:** Chapters 8, 9, and 18 collectively


## Overall Assessment

As a long-term GM who prefers simplicity and runs games for casual players, this rulebook presents a bit of a paradox. The core design philosophy is exactly what I want: fiction-first, flexible, focused on story over crunch. The mechanical foundation (4d6, four attributes, Tags/Conditions/Clocks) is elegant and learnable.

However, the presentation undermines the system's accessibility. Thirty chapters is a lot for what should feel like a "pick up and play" experience. The reference sections are comprehensive but not optimized for the busy GM who needs quick answers during play.

My recommendation: Create a "Quick Start" condensation that captures the core loop in 4-6 pages. The full rulebook can remain the authoritative reference, but casual tables need an entry point that doesn't require committing to a 30-chapter read.

For my specific needs - World Simulator GMing with casual groups who prefer focused systems - this scores a solid 6.5/10. The bones are excellent. The presentation needs streamlining for my use case.
