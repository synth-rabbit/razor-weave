## Narrative Feedback

Okay so I'm new to TTRPGs and I picked up this Razorweave book because I heard it was "fiction-first" which sounded cool, but honestly? I'm kind of confused about how to actually optimize my character.

The book spends A LOT of time talking about "intent" and "approach" and the collaborative storytelling stuff, which is nice I guess, but where are the hard numbers? The attribute system is simple enough (I got that - 2/1/1/0 spread), but the Skills and Proficiencies are completely open-ended. They literally say "work with your GM to define custom entries." How am I supposed to know if Machinery Handling is better than Technical Work? There's no chart comparing them!

The 4d6 dice system is interesting - I like that Advantage/Disadvantage lets you roll more dice and keep the best or worst 4. That part is clean and I can see some strategy there. The DC ladder from 12-22 is also clearly laid out, which I appreciate.

But here's what really gets me: there are NO hit points. They use "Resolve Clocks" instead. As a power gamer, this throws me off completely. I can't calculate damage per round. I can't figure out my optimal action economy. The book says a "Full Success on a Strike ticks 2 segments" but segment sizes vary? So I can't actually math out whether it's better to Set Up or just Strike repeatedly?

The character creation chapter has good step-by-step instructions, and I did manage to follow along with the Rella example. But when I got to Skills and Proficiencies, I hit a wall. The book says "the best choices are the ones that support the kinds of scenes you want to experience" - but I want to WIN the scenes! Where's the optimization guide?

I will say the writing is very clear and the examples help a lot. The "When to Roll" section explaining Uncertainty, Consequence, and Agency is genuinely useful. The outcome tiers (Critical Success, Full Success, Partial Success, Failure, Critical Failure) with their margin ranges (+5, 0, -1 to -2, -3 or worse, -7 or worse) gave me something concrete to work with.

The combat section frustrated me though. "Conversational order" and "popcorn order"? I'm used to initiative rolls determining who goes first. This system basically leaves it up to... vibes? And the "what does taken out mean" discussion before each fight sounds tedious when I just want to crush enemies efficiently.

This book seems designed for people who care more about story than mechanics, and as someone who wants to optimize and find the best builds, I'm left wanting more crunch. The rules are internally consistent (high accuracy there), but they don't give me the tools I need to maximize my effectiveness.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Step Four: Choose Skills / Step Five: Choose Proficiencies

**Issue:** No comparative analysis or tier ranking for skills and proficiencies

**Impact:** Cannot determine optimal character builds; new players have no framework for evaluating choices

**Location:** Chapter 6, approximately mid-chapter

### 2. Resolve Instead of Hit Points

**Issue:** Variable Resolve Clock sizes make damage calculations impossible

**Impact:** Cannot optimize combat strategy or compare action effectiveness mathematically

**Location:** Chapter 10, Combat Basics

### 3. Turns and Order

**Issue:** No default initiative system; relies on 'conversational' or 'popcorn' order

**Impact:** Unpredictable turn order prevents planning optimal action sequences

**Location:** Chapter 10, Combat Basics

### 4. Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Explicitly states Skills/Proficiencies are not from a fixed list - encourages custom creation

**Impact:** No balance framework; power gamers cannot compare builds across different tables

**Location:** Chapter 6, between Steps Three and Four

### 5. Setting DCs

**Issue:** DCs are set by GM based on fictional positioning rather than fixed encounter ratings

**Impact:** Cannot predict difficulty of challenges; optimization relies on GM interpretation

**Location:** Chapter 8, Actions, Checks, and Outcomes


## Overall Assessment

As a newbie power gamer, Razorweave frustrates me. The core mechanics (4d6, Advantage/Disadvantage, margin-based outcomes) are elegant and clearly explained. Rules accuracy is solid - I didn't find contradictions. But the whole "fiction-first" philosophy and open-ended character options make optimization nearly impossible.

This book is well-written for what it is: a narrative-focused RPG that trusts the table to collaborate. For players like me who want clear build paths, damage calculators, and tactical depth, it's the wrong tool. I give it middling marks because it's honest about what it is - it just isn't what I want.

Persona fit is low because power gaming simply isn't what this system supports. If you want to "win" at Razorweave, you have to accept that winning means telling a good story, not maximizing numbers. That's a fundamental mismatch with my playstyle.
