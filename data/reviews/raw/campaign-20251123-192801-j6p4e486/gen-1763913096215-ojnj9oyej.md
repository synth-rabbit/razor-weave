## Narrative Feedback

As a Tactician who has run and played in countless campaigns, I find this rulebook does many things right, though it leaves me wanting more structure in certain key areas.

The fiction-first philosophy resonates deeply with my Evangelical stance on narrative gaming. The book articulates beautifully why we start with story and reach for dice only when uncertainty matters. Chapter 4's Core Principles of Play is particularly well-crafted—it gives me exactly the language I need to onboard new players into this mindset.

However, as a Railroad Conductor style GM, I notice the book leans heavily toward emergent play without providing enough scaffolding for GMs who prefer more structured session design. The combat chapter's use of Resolve Clocks instead of hit points is elegant in theory, but as a Concrete Thinker, I struggle with the lack of explicit guidelines for sizing these clocks. 'The GM can size clocks to match the scene' isn't actionable enough for me—I want DC equivalency tables, or at least suggested segment counts by enemy tier.

The 4d6 resolution system with Advantage/Disadvantage scaling is tactically interesting. I appreciate that multiple sources cap at ±2—this prevents the mathematical snowballing I've seen break other systems. The outcome tier spread (Critical Success at +5 margin, Partial at -1 to -2, Failure at -3 or worse) gives good granularity for tactical decision-making.

Where the book falls short for my playstyle is practical table reference. The DC ladder is clear (12/14/16/18/20/22), but I need quick-reference sheets showing how Tags translate to Advantage/Disadvantage in common situations. When running combat, I don't want to re-read paragraphs mid-scene—I want a one-page summary showing 'Dim Light = -1 Disadvantage to ranged,' 'Elevated = +1 Advantage from high ground,' etc.

The character creation chapter has excellent structure but buries critical information. The nine-step flow is great for first-time character builders, but experienced players need a quick-reference checklist. Similarly, the Skills and Proficiencies chapters are comprehensive but lack the dense reference tables that let me adjudicate on the fly.

Overall, this is a thoughtful system that will shine at tables committed to fiction-first play. For Tacticians like me who want the narrative flexibility but also crave concrete mechanical scaffolding, the rulebook needs supplementary materials or a denser GM reference section.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Combat Basics - Resolve Clocks

**Issue:** No concrete guidance for sizing Resolve Clocks

**Impact:** GMs must guess at appropriate clock sizes, leading to inconsistent pacing and difficulty calibration across encounters

**Location:** Section discussing enemy Resolve (Why Clocks and Not Hit Points)

### 2. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes - Setting DCs

**Issue:** DC ladder exists but lacks context-specific examples

**Impact:** Concrete Thinkers need worked examples mapping specific fictional situations to DC values; the abstract ladder is insufficient for confident adjudication

**Location:** DC ladder section (DC 12 Easy through DC 22 Legendary)

### 3. Advantage/Disadvantage - Tag Integration

**Issue:** No consolidated reference for common Tag effects

**Impact:** During play, GMs must search through multiple chapters to determine how environmental Tags translate to mechanical Advantage/Disadvantage

**Location:** Section on Advantage, Disadvantage, Tags, and Conditions

### 4. Combat - Turn Structure

**Issue:** Action economy lacks precise boundaries

**Impact:** The guidance that small actions can be folded into turns if they feel reasonable is too subjective for tactical-minded players who want clear limits

**Location:** Your Turn: Structure and Options section

### 5. Character Creation

**Issue:** Nine-step process lacks quick-reference summary

**Impact:** Experienced players rebuilding characters or GMs helping at character creation sessions need a one-page checklist, not chapter re-reading

**Location:** The Creation Flow section listing steps 1-9


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook presents a coherent fiction-first system with genuinely interesting tactical elements. The 4d6 resolution with bounded Advantage/Disadvantage is elegant, and the Resolve Clock system offers narrative flexibility that hit points cannot. However, the book prioritizes philosophy over practicality in ways that will challenge Concrete Thinkers and GMs who prefer structured guidance. Rating breakdown: Clarity earns 8/10 for excellent prose and concept explanation, but Rules Accuracy drops to 7/10 due to gaps in explicit guidance that leave too much to GM interpretation. Persona Fit scores 7/10—the system aligns with my fiction-first values but doesn't provide the mechanical scaffolding my Tactician instincts crave. Practical Usability is 6/10—strong as a teaching document, weak as a table reference. I would run this system, but I'd create my own reference sheets first.
