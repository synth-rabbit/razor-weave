## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been running games for as long as I can remember, I approach any new system with a mix of excitement and skepticism. When I first picked up Razorweave, I was immediately drawn to its fiction-first philosophy - this is exactly the kind of design I've been evangelizing to my tables for years.

The book's structure is excellent. The progression from Welcome to Core Concepts to How to Use This Rulebook creates a gentle on-ramp that respects both newcomers and veterans. The way Chapter 3 explicitly addresses "Rules as Tools" resonates deeply with my play style. I've watched too many tables get bogged down in rule-lawyering, so seeing this philosophy baked into the core text is refreshing.

The 4d6 resolution system with its margin-based outcome tiers is elegant. I appreciate how the five-tier outcome structure (Critical Success through Critical Failure) creates narrative texture without overwhelming complexity. The Advantage/Disadvantage system using extra dice (5d6 or 6d6, keeping best or worst 4) is intuitive and satisfying at the table.

What truly excites me as an achiever-oriented player is the Clock system. This mechanic gives tangible progress tracking that scratches that completionist itch while staying entirely narrative. The dual-clock examples throughout the book (Evacuation vs. Flood Waters, Investigation vs. Cover-Up) demonstrate sophisticated pacing control that I can immediately deploy in my campaigns.

However, I have some concerns. The open-ended Skills and Proficiencies system, while flexible, creates significant GM burden. The book acknowledges this with "The GM has final approval over the scope of any custom Skill or Proficiency" but provides limited guidance on calibration. For someone like me who prefers clear achievement markers, this ambiguity is frustrating.

The combat section's use of Resolve Clocks instead of hit points is philosophically sound but may challenge players expecting traditional damage tracking. The explanation of "Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?" helps, but the transition guidance could be stronger.

The character creation walkthrough using Rella as a consistent example throughout is pedagogically excellent - a teaching technique I'll borrow for my own table introductions.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Character Creation - Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Insufficient calibration guidance for custom Skills/Proficiencies

**Impact:** GMs may struggle to maintain balance when players propose creative options, potentially leading to table disputes or inconsistent rulings across sessions

**Location:** Chapter 6, 'Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies' subsection

### 2. Combat Basics - Resolve Instead of Hit Points

**Issue:** Transition guidance for players familiar with traditional HP systems is minimal

**Impact:** Players coming from D&D or similar systems may feel disoriented or resist the paradigm shift, creating friction during early sessions

**Location:** Chapter 10, 'Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?' subsection

### 3. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The margin calculation (Roll - DC) is buried in procedural text

**Impact:** Quick reference during play becomes difficult; this core mechanic deserves a highlighted callout box or summary table

**Location:** Chapter 8, 'Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin' subsection

### 4. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Common Tag categories reference Chapter 18 for 'extended reference' but examples could be more comprehensive here

**Impact:** Readers must flip between chapters during learning, disrupting comprehension flow

**Location:** Chapter 9, 'Common Tag Categories' subsection


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave Core Rulebook delivers a thoughtfully designed fiction-first system that aligns well with modern narrative TTRPG sensibilities. The book's structure and pedagogy are strong, with the Rella example character providing excellent continuity through the character creation process.

For achiever-oriented players like myself, the Clock system provides satisfying progress tracking while maintaining narrative flexibility. The 4d6 resolution with margin-based outcomes creates meaningful decision points without procedural bloat.

The book's main weakness lies in its handling of the open-ended Skills/Proficiencies system - more calibration examples and edge case guidance would strengthen GM confidence. Similarly, the transition from hit points to Resolve Clocks deserves more explicit bridging content for players coming from traditional systems.

Despite being labeled as a "Forever GM" with evangelical fiction-first alignment, I note that my persona profile indicates "Non-GM" philosophy - this contradiction aside, the book serves experienced facilitators well while remaining accessible to newcomers.

Recommended with reservations: excellent for tables already aligned with fiction-first principles, but may require supplementary conversation for groups transitioning from crunchier systems. Rating: 7/10 overall.
