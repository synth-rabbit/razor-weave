## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's dipping their toes into fiction-first gaming while still wanting solid mechanical grounding, I found Razorweave to be a mixed experience. The writing is clear and the concepts are explained well - I can follow the logic of intent and approach, and the 4d6 system with its margin-based outcomes makes sense on paper.

But here's my struggle: I need concrete numbers to feel confident at the table. The book talks beautifully about Tags and Conditions shaping the fiction, but I kept wanting more specific guidance. When exactly does 'Dim Light' give Disadvantage versus just changing the narrative? The answer seems to be 'when it matters' - which is philosophically elegant but leaves me second-guessing myself constantly.

The Resolve Clock system instead of hit points is interesting, but as someone who also GMs, I worry about consistency. How many segments should a trained guard have? The book says 'size clocks to match the scene' but doesn't give me a baseline to work from. I'm the kind of person who needs to prep encounters with some certainty about their difficulty.

The DC ladder (12-22) is helpful, but I noticed the book emphasizes fictional positioning so heavily that I'm not always sure when to use which DC. Is a 'tough' task always DC 16, or does it depend on circumstances the book leaves deliberately vague?

The system clearly works for groups comfortable with improvisation, but as a cautious player who prefers focused systems over universal toolkits, I feel like I'd need a lot of table time before I'd feel confident running this. It's well-written - just not quite designed for how I like to play.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** DC setting guidance is conceptual rather than concrete

**Impact:** GMs who need firm guidelines will struggle to consistently set appropriate DCs without extensive experience

**Location:** Setting DCs subsection - the ladder is provided but application remains highly situational

### 2. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** No quantified baselines for Tag effects

**Impact:** Players who need concrete numbers cannot predict when Tags will mechanically affect their rolls vs just coloring description

**Location:** Using Tags and Conditions with Checks - guidance says 'quickly review' without specifying thresholds

### 3. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock sizing lacks reference numbers

**Impact:** New GMs cannot confidently build balanced encounters without trial and error

**Location:** Resolve Instead of Hit Points - mentions 2-3 segments for 'quick threats' but no enemy reference table

### 4. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Skill and Proficiency selection feels open-ended for players wanting guidance

**Impact:** Casual players may feel paralyzed by choice without pre-built templates or strong recommendations

**Location:** Throughout the character creation process


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a well-crafted fiction-first system that will serve experienced narrative gamers excellently. However, as a Casual Gamer who is still Converting to fiction-first approaches and Needs Concrete Numbers to feel confident, I find the system philosophically sound but practically challenging. The 4d6 + margin system is elegant, and the writing is genuinely clear - my issues aren't with comprehension but with application. I'd recommend this for tables that enjoy improvisational play and are comfortable with GM interpretation. For players like me who prefer focused systems with predictable mechanical interactions, the learning curve will be steeper than the clean prose suggests. Not a criticism of quality, but a matter of fit.
