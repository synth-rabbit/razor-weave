## Narrative Feedback

As someone brand new to tabletop RPGs, I found the Razorweave Core Rulebook both inviting and overwhelming. The writing is genuinely clear - I appreciated how each chapter builds on the previous one, and the consistent use of "intent" and "approach" language helped me understand what's expected during play. The examples throughout the book are well-constructed and show real gameplay situations.

However, I'm honestly skeptical about this whole "fiction first" philosophy. The book keeps saying mechanics should follow the story, but as a newcomer, I need more structure - not less. When it says "no Check is needed" for routine actions, how am I supposed to know what's routine? The system assumes a level of improvisational comfort that I don't yet have.

I really struggled with the abstract nature of Tags, Conditions, and Clocks. They're presented as flexible tools, but that flexibility feels like a burden. When anything can be a Tag, I don't know what should be a Tag. The examples help, but I kept wishing for more concrete lists and definitive rules. The open Skills and Proficiencies system is my biggest concern - being told to "work with my GM to define custom entries" is daunting when I don't even know what a good entry looks like.

I do appreciate that the book acknowledges different play styles. The GM guidance boxes are helpful, and the safety tools chapter shows real thought about the play experience. The structure of sessions and campaigns makes sense on paper. But I worry that without a focused genre or setting, I'll flounder trying to apply these universal tools to a specific story.

My experimental side wants to try the system anyway - there are interesting ideas here about how outcomes create story momentum. But I need more scaffolding before I could confidently run or play in a Razorweave game.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 4 - Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy may confuse newbies about when rules apply

**Impact:** New players may feel uncertain about triggering mechanics, leading to hesitation during play

**Location:** Section on 'Fiction First, Mechanics Second'

### 2. Chapter 6 - Character Creation - Skills/Proficiencies

**Issue:** Open list approach lacks concrete guidance for new players

**Impact:** Character creation becomes anxiety-inducing when players must invent their own mechanical options

**Location:** Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies section

### 3. Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, Clocks

**Issue:** Highly abstract system with insufficient starter templates

**Impact:** The flexibility of Tags/Clocks feels overwhelming without genre-specific examples to anchor understanding

**Location:** Throughout chapter

### 4. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, Outcomes

**Issue:** DC determination guidance is too contextual for beginners

**Impact:** Setting appropriate DCs requires experience that new GMs lack, potentially leading to inconsistent gameplay

**Location:** Setting DCs with context subsection

### 5. Chapter 21 - Running Sessions

**Issue:** GM advice assumes baseline facilitator experience

**Impact:** First-time GMs may struggle to implement 'facilitator of consequences' role without more structured examples

**Location:** GM Mindset for Razorweave


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a well-written, thoughtfully organized system that will likely work beautifully for experienced players who embrace narrative-first gaming. The 4d6 resolution system is elegant, the outcome tiers create natural story beats, and the advice throughout demonstrates deep understanding of tabletop play.

However, as a complete newcomer who prefers more focused systems, I found the book asks too much of me. The universal nature of the toolkit - applicable to any genre, with open-ended character options, and flexible Tags/Clocks - means I constantly have to make judgment calls I'm not yet equipped to make. The skeptic in me wonders: if the rules just "support" the fiction, what exactly am I learning when I learn these rules?

I would recommend this book to new players only if they have an experienced GM who can provide the structure the book intentionally leaves open. For a table of all-newbies, I'd suggest starting with a more focused system or waiting for a genre-specific Razorweave supplement.

Rating Summary: Good clarity (7), solid rules consistency (8), poor fit for this persona (5), moderate practical usability (6). Average: 6.5/10.
