## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's run countless campaigns and loves diving into rich narratives, I found myself genuinely intrigued by Razorweave's fiction-first philosophy. The emphasis on "what happens next?" as the driving question resonates with my storytelling instincts. I appreciate how the rulebook positions mechanics as tools that support the story rather than define it.

However, I have to be honest about my frustrations. While I'm curious about fiction-first design, I really need concrete numbers to feel grounded in a system. The DC ladder (12-22) and outcome tiers are helpful, but I found myself wanting more specific guidance. When exactly do I call for a check versus just narrating? The text says "when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain and stakes matter," but that feels subjective. I need more pattern recognition cues.

The Skills and Proficiencies chapters impressed me with their structure. The skill entries follow a clear template: Description, Default Actions, Synergies/Counters, GM Usage Notes. This pattern-driven approach works well for how I process information. I can scan entries and quickly understand when each skill applies.

What concerns me is the lack of certain concrete elements I rely on when running games. There are no explicit hit points or damage values that I noticed in my read-through. For a pattern-driven mind like mine, understanding the mathematical relationships between choices helps me feel confident. The Tag and Condition system is elegant but abstract - I'd want worked examples showing the math behind modifier stacking.

The multiple play modes (group, duet, solo, GMless) show flexibility, but as someone who prefers focused systems, I wonder if trying to serve all masters makes it harder to excel at any one. I'd rather have one play mode done exceptionally well than several done adequately.

The examples throughout the text are genuinely helpful. They follow consistent patterns and show the flow from fiction to mechanics and back. The "torn paper" aesthetic blocks for examples and GM guidance make scanning easy. I found myself building mental models of play based on these examples.

Overall, Razorweave has good bones for narrative play. If you're comfortable with interpretive mechanics and emergent gameplay, you'll find a thoughtful system here. For someone like me who craves more explicit structure while remaining curious about looser approaches, it's a stretch that might be rewarding with the right group - but I'd want more table time before feeling confident running it.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The criteria for when to call for checks versus narrating is explained philosophically but lacks concrete decision trees or flowcharts

**Impact:** GMs who need explicit guidance may struggle to maintain consistency in when dice are rolled

**Location:** Core resolution section discussing 'meaningful uncertainty'

### 2. Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Modifier stacking rules for advantage/disadvantage are mentioned but the mathematical implications aren't fully explored

**Impact:** Pattern-driven players may want to see probability distributions or explicit stacking limits more prominently

**Location:** Advantage and Disadvantage subsection

### 3. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Combat resolution leans heavily on fiction-first adjudication without explicit damage/health tracking systems visible

**Impact:** Players who need concrete numbers for tactical decision-making may feel unanchored

**Location:** Combat flow and resolution

### 4. Part II: Skills and Proficiencies Reference

**Issue:** While skill entries are well-structured, the relationship between skill bonuses and outcome probabilities isn't made explicit

**Impact:** Makes it harder to evaluate character build choices numerically

**Location:** Skills system overview and reference chapters

### 5. Chapter 5: Ways to Play

**Issue:** Supporting multiple play modes may dilute focus on any single mode's excellence

**Impact:** Players preferring focused systems may find the breadth overwhelming rather than valuable

**Location:** Play modes overview section


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave is a thoughtfully designed fiction-first system with clear writing and consistent internal structure. The rulebook demonstrates strong pedagogical design through its layered chapters, consistent examples, and clear progression from concepts to mechanics to reference. For storyteller-minded players who want narrative flow with occasional mechanical grounding, it offers a compelling framework.

However, the system may challenge players who need more explicit numerical scaffolding. While my curiosity about fiction-first play is piqued, my preference for concrete numbers and focused systems means I'd approach Razorweave as an interesting experiment rather than a new go-to system. The lack of explicit damage tracking, the interpretive nature of when to call for checks, and the breadth of play modes all work against my preferred cognitive style.

The strongest elements are the skill/proficiency reference format, the DC ladder with clear outcome tiers, and the Tag/Condition system that adds fictional texture without heavy bookkeeping. These demonstrate thoughtful design that respects both narrative and mechanical play.

My recommendation: Excellent for groups already comfortable with narrative-first games who want more structure than PbtA but less than traditional d20 systems. For groups wanting explicit tactical combat or detailed character building math, look elsewhere or plan for significant adaptation work.
