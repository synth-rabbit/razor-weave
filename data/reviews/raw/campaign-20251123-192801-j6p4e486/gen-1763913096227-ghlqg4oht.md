## Narrative Feedback

As someone who thrives on achieving concrete goals and has experience both running and playing in games, I have mixed feelings about this rulebook. The writing is clear enough - I can follow the explanations and the structure makes sense. But there's a fundamental tension between what this game promises and what I need from a system.

The fiction-first philosophy permeates everything, and as someone skeptical of that approach, I find myself constantly asking: where are the concrete benchmarks? Where are the victory conditions? The system keeps telling me the story comes first, but I need to know what winning looks like.

I run GMless games, and while Chapter 26 promises 'Alternative Play' including GMless options, the core of this book is heavily GM-centric. Every example assumes a traditional GM/Player split. For a system that claims flexibility, it feels like GMless play is an afterthought rather than a first-class mode.

The abstraction in the mechanics worries me. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are described as 'descriptors that shape how the world and characters behave' - but that's vague. I want precise rules for when a Clock advances, exactly how many segments it has, what happens when it fills. The book seems to trust the table to figure this out, which works for narrative-focused groups but leaves achievement-oriented players like me without clear goalposts.

The genre-specific nature of my preferences clashes with the 'many different genres' promise. I want systems tailored to specific fictional worlds, not universal frameworks that try to do everything. A fantasy game should feel different from a sci-fi game at the mechanical level, not just the narrative dressing.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Principles of Play (Chapter 4)

**Issue:** Insufficient mechanical constraints for GMless play

**Impact:** Players who prefer distributed authority must improvise procedures not specified in the text

**Location:** The Table Is a Creative Team subsection

### 2. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks (Chapter 9)

**Issue:** Abstract tracking mechanisms lack precise advancement triggers

**Impact:** Achievement-oriented players cannot reliably measure progress or plan optimal strategies

**Location:** Core concepts overview and Chapter 9 proper

### 3. Character Creation (Chapter 6)

**Issue:** Character optimization paths not explicitly defined

**Impact:** Achiever-type players have no clear build goals or mechanical benchmarks to pursue

**Location:** Throughout character creation procedure

### 4. Alternative Play (Chapter 26)

**Issue:** GMless mode relegated to optional chapter rather than integrated design

**Impact:** Core procedures assume GM presence, requiring significant adaptation for GMless tables

**Location:** Chapter 26 and its relationship to core rules

### 5. Skills and Proficiencies (Part II)

**Issue:** Skill boundaries blur with narrative interpretation

**Impact:** Difficult to know exactly which mechanical option to select for optimal outcomes

**Location:** Chapters 14-17


## Overall Assessment

This is a well-organized rulebook with clear writing and consistent terminology. The production quality is evident in the structure and cross-referencing. However, for my playstyle, it presents significant friction points.

The core tension is philosophical: Razorweave trusts the table to make judgment calls that I would prefer to be systematized. The fiction-first approach privileges narrative emergence over predictable outcomes. For players seeking achievement, mastery, and clear success metrics, this can feel frustrating.

The GMless advocacy in my approach finds little direct support. While the book acknowledges alternative play modes, the core architecture assumes a traditional GM. Converting this to distributed authority requires substantial house-ruling.

The genre-agnostic design means no mechanic feels perfectly tuned for any specific setting. For someone who prefers systems that deeply engage with particular fictional worlds, this universal approach dilutes mechanical identity.

Rating Summary:
- Clarity: Strong. The writing is professional and the organization logical.
- Accuracy: Consistent within its own fiction-first framework.
- Fit: Poor for my specific combination of traits. The book is designed for a different kind of player.
- Usability: Moderate. At-table reference is supported by good structure, but the interpretive burden is high.

Recommendation: This rulebook serves its intended audience well but is not aligned with achievement-focused, GMless-preferring, genre-specific players. I would need significant adaptation to run the kind of game I enjoy.
