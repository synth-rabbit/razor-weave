## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been playing for a couple of years and really gets into the tactical side of combat, I find this rulebook has solid bones but doesn't quite scratch my itch for decisive confrontation. The fiction-first approach is well explained, and I appreciate how Tags and Conditions integrate into the resolution system - that gives me levers to pull in fights. The Resolve Clock system instead of hit points is actually pretty clever; I like that visible progress means I can feel when an enemy is about to break.

The combat chapter does a decent job explaining Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, and Defend/Withdraw actions. I can see how to build toward impactful moments - setting up Advantage before committing to Strikes makes tactical sense. But here's my frustration: the book keeps emphasizing narrative tools and collaborative storytelling when I want more crunch about *winning*. What makes one Strike more devastating than another? How do I stack Tags effectively? The guidance feels aimed at players who want story beats rather than players who want to dominate the battlefield.

The 4d6 system with margin-based outcomes is clean enough to keep combat moving, which I appreciate. I don't want to be bogged down in calculation when there's a fight to win. But I wish there was more discussion of optimal builds, powerful Skill combinations, or how to specialize a character for combat excellence. The character creation chapter feels balanced toward well-rounded characters rather than focused specialists.

I genuinely appreciate the Clocks mechanic for long-term projects and threats - that gives strategic depth to planning engagements. And the Tags system creates meaningful tactical terrain. Those are my favorite mechanical elements.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Combat Basics (Chapter 10)

**Issue:** Insufficient mechanical differentiation between Strike types and damage scaling

**Impact:** Killer players lack clarity on how to optimize for maximum combat effectiveness; all attacks feel mechanically similar regardless of setup or approach

**Location:** Core Combat Actions subsection, specifically the Strike action description

### 2. Character Creation (Chapter 6)

**Issue:** No guidance on building combat-focused specialists vs generalists

**Impact:** Players seeking to create dominant combatants cannot easily identify which Skill/Proficiency combinations maximize combat performance

**Location:** Skill selection guidance and attribute prioritization

### 3. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes (Chapter 8)

**Issue:** Critical Success and outcome tier bonuses feel under-specified for combat contexts

**Impact:** Rolling exceptionally well doesn't feel proportionally rewarding; margin +5 should feel dramatically different from margin +0 in combat

**Location:** Interpreting Outcomes subsection

### 4. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks (Chapter 9)

**Issue:** Tag stacking rules and interaction priority unclear

**Impact:** Cannot plan tactical sequences confidently when multiple Tags and Conditions interact; uncertain whether advantages compound meaningfully

**Location:** Using Tags and Conditions with Checks subsection

### 5. Exploration and Social Play (Chapter 11)

**Issue:** Disproportionate page space given to non-combat activities relative to combat tactics

**Impact:** Killer players must piece together advanced combat strategies while other playstyles receive extensive guidance

**Location:** Chapter-level balance throughout Part I


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a competent fiction-first system that will serve many tables well, but it doesn't fully meet the needs of players who prioritize tactical combat mastery. The mechanical foundation is sound - the 4d6 resolution, Advantage/Disadvantage system, and Clock mechanics all work together elegantly. The Resolve Clock system is a genuine innovation that I prefer over traditional hit points.

However, the book's strong narrative emphasis comes at the cost of tactical depth for combat-focused players. I can see *how* to fight, but the book rarely discusses *how to fight well*. Advanced combat optimization, build theory, and tactical stacking of effects are left as exercises for the reader. For a Killer archetype with a few years of experience, this creates frustration - I understand the basics but want guidance on mastery that simply isn't here.

The book earns solid marks for clarity and internal consistency. Rules are well-explained and examples are helpful. But the persona fit is middling because the design philosophy clearly prioritizes collaborative storytelling over competitive tactical excellence. I can make this work, but I'll need to develop house rules and interpretations to get the combat depth I'm looking for.
