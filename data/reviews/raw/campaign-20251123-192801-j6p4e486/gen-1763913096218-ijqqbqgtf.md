## Narrative Feedback

Okay so I'm pretty new to tabletop games - my friends got me into this a few months ago and I've been trying to learn different systems. I really like games where I can figure out the optimal strategies and make powerful characters that do cool things in combat.

Reading through this rulebook, I have mixed feelings. The writing is pretty clear at the start, and I like that it tells you upfront this is about "fiction first" - my friends have been trying to explain that concept to me. But here's my problem: I kept looking for the combat builds and the character optimization stuff, and... it's kind of buried?

Like, I want to know what the BEST attributes are, which skills give me the biggest advantage, how to maximize my damage in fights. The book keeps talking about "intent and approach" and "meaningful uncertainty" but I just want to know the numbers. What do I roll? What beats what? The examples are okay but they're all about storytelling moments, not about actually winning fights.

Chapter 10 on Combat Basics was the part I was most interested in, but it felt shorter than I expected. I wanted tactical options, action economy breakdowns, maybe a flowchart of optimal plays. Instead it's more philosophy about how combat should feel.

I'm curious about this fiction-first approach everyone talks about, but honestly the book assumes you already understand why you'd want that. For someone like me who comes from video games where I min-max everything, I need more convincing. Tell me WHY optimal builds don't matter as much, or show me how the system still rewards tactical thinking even if it's not about numbers.

The character creation chapter was fine, but I got frustrated by having to flip between like five different chapters to figure out what proficiencies to pick. Just put all the options in one place! I don't want to read backstory for each skill, I want a comparison chart.

The Glossary is helpful though. I keep it open while reading.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Combat chapter prioritizes narrative philosophy over tactical mechanics

**Impact:** As a Killer archetype player, I want to understand action economy, damage types, positioning advantages, and optimal combat strategies. The chapter gives me feelings but not enough crunch to satisfy my playstyle.

**Location:** Entire chapter - need more tactical depth and numbered examples

### 2. Chapters 14-15: Skills Reference

**Issue:** No at-a-glance comparison of skill effectiveness or tier rankings

**Impact:** I can't quickly identify which skills are mechanically strongest or most versatile. For character optimization, I need to read every single entry. A power ranking or use-case comparison would help.

**Location:** Throughout both chapters

### 3. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Character creation requires excessive cross-referencing between chapters

**Impact:** Building an optimized character requires flipping between 5+ chapters. This slows down the process and makes it hard to compare options side-by-side. Consider consolidated build worksheets.

**Location:** Steps involving Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies selection

### 4. Chapter 2: Core Concepts

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy is presented but not explicitly justified for mechanically-minded players

**Impact:** The book assumes I already want narrative play. As someone curious but skeptical, I need to understand how fiction-first can still reward system mastery and tactical thinking.

**Location:** Fiction First and related subsections

### 5. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, Outcomes

**Issue:** Difficulty thresholds and modifier math not clearly laid out in quick-reference format

**Impact:** I want to know exactly what numbers beat what. The philosophical framing is nice but I need concrete DC examples and modifier stacking rules to plan my character's capabilities.

**Location:** Check resolution procedures


## Overall Assessment

This rulebook clearly has thought put into it, and I can tell it's well-designed for people who already love storytelling in games. But for someone like me - a newbie who's naturally drawn to optimization and winning - it's a challenging read. The fiction-first approach is interesting and I'm curious to try it, but the book doesn't do enough to bridge the gap for mechanically-minded players. I wanted combat tactics, build guides, and clear numeric breakdowns. Instead I got philosophy about collaborative storytelling. That's probably good for some people, but I spent a lot of time looking for information that either isn't there or is spread across too many chapters. My recommendation: add some "For the Tactician" sidebars that explain how mechanical players can still engage meaningfully with the system. Also, consolidated reference sheets would make character creation way less frustrating. I'll probably need my more experienced friends to help me through my first few sessions.
