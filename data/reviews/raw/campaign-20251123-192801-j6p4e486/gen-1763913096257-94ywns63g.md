## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has run countless games and loves discovering how systems interconnect, this rulebook presents an interesting tension for me. The core 4d6 resolution mechanic with its margin-based outcomes is elegant and I can see how all the pieces fit together - Tags flow into Advantage/Disadvantage, which modifies dice pools, which affects margins, which determines outcome tiers. That kind of systematic coherence is deeply satisfying.

However, I find myself frustrated by what feels like a lack of concrete numerical guidance in several places. The book tells me to "use Clocks when something matters over time" but does not give me enough worked examples of how many segments to use for different situations. As someone who needs concrete numbers to feel confident running a game, the heavy reliance on "GM judgment" and "fiction first" leaves me wanting more scaffolding.

The Genre-Agnostic design is admirable but creates problems for me as a Genre-Specific Purist. I gravitate toward particular settings, and while the book claims to support any genre, I would need to do significant work to make it feel right for my preferred style. The examples span cozy mysteries, sci-fi stations, and horror investigations without deeply committing to any one tone.

What I appreciate most is the systematic integration of Tags, Conditions, and Clocks - these three tools clearly form a coherent framework that touches everything from combat to social encounters to long-term campaign pressures. The Resolve Clock replacing hit points is a smart design that I can see working well in practice.

What I struggle with is the assumption that I should be comfortable making rulings on the fly. Even with experience, I prefer systems that tell me exactly what happens rather than asking me to interpret. The DC ladder is helpful but the guidance around when to use which DC feels vague.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Setting DCs Section

**Issue:** The DC ladder (12-22) is provided but guidance on choosing between tiers relies heavily on GM intuition rather than concrete criteria.

**Impact:** GMs who prefer structured decision-making may struggle to set consistent DCs, leading to perceived unfairness or slowed gameplay.

**Location:** Chapter 8, 'Setting DCs' subsection

### 2. Clock Segment Guidance

**Issue:** The book mentions 4, 6, or 8 segment Clocks but provides limited guidance on when to use each size beyond 'scope.'

**Impact:** New GMs or those preferring concrete numbers may over- or under-estimate Clock sizes, affecting pacing and tension.

**Location:** Chapter 9, 'What Clocks Are' and 'Advancing Clocks' subsections

### 3. Genre-Specific Examples

**Issue:** Examples are spread across multiple genres (cozy town, sci-fi station, horror mystery) without deep investment in any one.

**Impact:** GMs focused on a specific genre may need to do additional work to translate examples to their preferred setting.

**Location:** Throughout Chapters 8-11, in example boxes

### 4. Advantage/Disadvantage Stacking

**Issue:** The cap at plus/minus 2 is clear, but the guidance on how to combine multiple Tags and Conditions into a single modifier could be more explicit with worked examples.

**Impact:** Complex scenes with many factors may lead to inconsistent adjudication between groups or even within a single campaign.

**Location:** Chapter 8, 'Advantage, Disadvantage, Tags, and Conditions' subsection

### 5. VPC Mechanical Integration

**Issue:** Virtual Player Characters are described conceptually but lack detailed mechanical differentiation from full PCs beyond narrative framing.

**Impact:** GMs wanting to run VPCs as meaningful mechanical entities need to improvise more than expected.

**Location:** Chapter 24, VPC sections


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook presents a cohesive, systematically integrated design that rewards understanding how its components interact. The 4d6 margin-based resolution, the Tag/Condition/Clock triad, and the Resolve-based combat all connect logically. For a Systems Integrator like myself, appreciating these connections is satisfying.

However, the book's commitment to "fiction first" and genre flexibility creates challenges for someone who needs concrete numbers and prefers genre-specific approaches. The reliance on GM judgment - while appropriate for experienced tables - means this rulebook requires more preparation and interpretation work than I would prefer. The numerical scaffolding exists but often feels like a starting point rather than a complete framework.

I would recommend this to GMs comfortable with narrative authority and improvisational ruling, but those seeking a more deterministic or genre-committed system may find the flexibility creates more work than it saves. The core mechanics are solid; the gap is in the guidance layer that helps you apply them confidently without extensive personal interpretation.
