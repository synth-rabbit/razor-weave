## Narrative Feedback

As a veteran player with over fifteen years of experience, particularly focused on tactical optimization and challenge mastery, I approach Razorweave with both appreciation and critical scrutiny. The fiction-first approach is well-articulated—I've played enough PbtA and Forged in the Dark games to recognize this design philosophy as solid—but the execution leaves gaps that matter for players like me.

The core mechanics are elegantly simple: Attribute + Skill checks with clear outcome tiers (Critical Success, Success, Partial Success, Failure, Catastrophe). I appreciate the unified resolution system—no hunting through different subsystems for different situations. The clock mechanics borrowed from Blades in the Dark are well-implemented and provide excellent campaign-level tension tracking.

However, as someone who thrives on tactical depth and system mastery, the combat section feels underdeveloped. Chapter 10 provides basics but lacks the crunch I want. Where are the tactical options that reward positioning? Where's the action economy that lets me plan optimal turns? The "fiction-first" mantra sometimes feels like an excuse to leave mechanical details unspecified.

The Skills and Proficiencies system (Chapters 14-17) shows promise. I appreciate that Skills are meant to be campaign-specific rather than a fixed list, but this flexibility creates uncertainty. How do I evaluate character build choices when the skill landscape is undefined? As a Systems Integrator, I want to see how the pieces fit together—and some pieces feel like placeholders.

That said, the advancement system (Chapter 19) has good bones. XP-based progression with meaningful milestone options gives me something to optimize toward. I'd like more explicit guidance on power scaling, but the framework supports the kind of long-term character development I enjoy.

The GM section (Part III) is comprehensive and shows mature design thinking. The factions and fronts system gives me confidence that campaigns will have real stakes and evolving threats. This is the kind of systemic world-building that keeps me engaged as both player and occasional GM.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Insufficient tactical depth for combat-focused players

**Impact:** Players seeking optimization and tactical mastery lack the mechanical hooks to engage deeply with combat encounters. Positioning, action economy, and tactical choices feel underspecified.

**Location:** Combat resolution section

### 2. Chapter 14: Skills System Overview

**Issue:** Skill list flexibility creates character building uncertainty

**Impact:** Without a defined skill list, veteran players cannot evaluate build choices or plan advancement paths. The "fiction-first" approach to skills makes system mastery difficult.

**Location:** Skill definition and selection guidance

### 3. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Partial Success outcomes leave too much to GM interpretation

**Impact:** Experienced players want predictable consequences to inform tactical decisions. Highly variable GM-interpreted outcomes reduce strategic planning value.

**Location:** Outcome tier definitions

### 4. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long Term Growth

**Issue:** Power scaling benchmarks not explicit

**Impact:** Difficult to assess character progression relative to expected challenges. Veterans want to understand the power curve to make informed build decisions.

**Location:** Advancement progression tables

### 5. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Optimization pathways unclear

**Impact:** Character creation guidance focuses on narrative fit rather than mechanical effectiveness. Players who enjoy build optimization lack guidance on synergies and trade-offs.

**Location:** Character creation workflow


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a competent fiction-first RPG framework that will serve narrative-focused tables well. For veteran Killer-archetype players like myself—those who thrive on tactical challenge, system mastery, and optimization—the system delivers approximately 70% of what we need.

The strengths are real: unified resolution mechanics, well-implemented campaign-level clocks, thoughtful GM guidance, and a flexible but structured advancement system. The design philosophy is coherent and the writing is clear.

The gaps are equally real: combat lacks tactical depth, skills are too undefined for strategic character building, and the fiction-first approach sometimes feels like it's avoiding mechanical specificity rather than embracing it purposefully.

My recommendation: Razorweave works best for tables that prioritize collaborative storytelling with occasional moments of mechanical resolution. For tables that want tactical depth, crunchier combat, or players who enjoy optimization puzzles, supplementary material or house rules will be needed. The foundation is solid enough to build on, but it's clearly a foundation rather than a complete structure for combat-focused play.
