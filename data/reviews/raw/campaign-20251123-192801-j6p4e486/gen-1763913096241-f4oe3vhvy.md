## Narrative Feedback

As someone just getting into tabletop RPGs who loves storytelling but wants solid rules to lean on, I found the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a mixed experience. The book is beautifully organized with its four-part structure (Foundations, Skills/Proficiencies, GM Section, and Reference), and I appreciate the comprehensive Table of Contents that helps me navigate the 29 chapters.

However, as a newbie, I often felt overwhelmed by the abstract concepts introduced early on. Terms like "fiction-first" and "narrative-mechanics interplay" in the Core Concepts chapter made me nervous - I came here for clear rules, not philosophical approaches to gaming. The book seems to assume I'm already sold on this style of play, but I'm skeptical. Where are the hard numbers I can rely on?

The Character Creation chapter (Chapter 6) was helpful, and I liked seeing concrete Attributes in Chapter 7. But then the "Actions, Checks, and Outcomes" section introduced more abstraction that made me uncomfortable. I need to know exactly what dice to roll and when, not just conceptual frameworks.

As a GM who prefers running structured campaigns with clear plot progression, I found the GM Section (Part III) frustrating. Chapters 21-26 on running sessions and campaigns seem designed for improvisational GMs, not someone like me who wants to plan things out. The "Factions, Fronts, and World Pressure" chapter (25) introduces yet more abstract systems when I just want a clear adventure structure.

The Skills Reference (Chapter 15) and Proficiencies Reference (Chapter 17) are genuinely useful - concrete, organized lists I can reference at the table. This is what I need more of. The Glossary (Chapter 28) and Index (Chapter 29) are also excellent resources for a beginner like me.

My biggest concern is that this system seems designed for a certain type of player who embraces narrative abstraction, which isn't me. I want my fantasy game to feel like fantasy, not a generic system that could be anything. The book doesn't give me the genre-specific guidance I'm looking for.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Concepts (Chapter 2)

**Issue:** Heavy reliance on abstract terminology without concrete examples for newcomers

**Impact:** New players may struggle to understand foundational concepts before learning actual rules

**Location:** Introduction to fiction-first philosophy and narrative principles

### 2. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes (Chapter 8)

**Issue:** The outcome framework feels too open-ended for players seeking clear mechanical guidance

**Impact:** Players wanting definitive 'you succeed' or 'you fail' results may feel lost in the grey areas

**Location:** Outcome determination sections

### 3. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks (Chapter 9)

**Issue:** Clocks system is abstract and may be confusing for traditional RPG players

**Impact:** GMs new to narrative mechanics may struggle to implement clocks effectively

**Location:** Clock mechanics explanation

### 4. Running Sessions (Chapter 21)

**Issue:** Session guidance assumes improvisational comfort that railroad-style GMs may lack

**Impact:** GMs who prefer structured adventures may feel unsupported in their playstyle

**Location:** Session flow and management advice

### 5. Character Creation (Chapter 6)

**Issue:** Lacks step-by-step numbered checklist for newbie-friendly creation

**Impact:** First-time players may miss steps or feel unsure if they've completed character creation correctly

**Location:** Overall chapter structure

### 6. Genre/Setting Content

**Issue:** No dedicated genre content - system feels generic rather than genre-specific

**Impact:** Players seeking a particular aesthetic (fantasy, sci-fi, etc.) don't get targeted support

**Location:** Throughout book - missing genre chapters


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a well-organized, professionally structured rulebook that will appeal to experienced players who enjoy narrative-focused systems. However, as a storyteller newbie who prefers concrete rules and structured play, I found myself frequently at odds with the book's philosophical approach. The abstract concepts introduced early create a barrier for newcomers like me who haven't yet developed comfort with fiction-first mechanics.

The book's strengths - comprehensive reference sections, clear organization, and the helpful Glossary and Index - are somewhat overshadowed by its assumption that readers will embrace the narrative-forward approach. For traditional GMs who want clear adventure structures rather than improvisational frameworks, the GM section may feel incomplete.

My recommendation: this book is better suited for players with some RPG experience who are looking to embrace more narrative-focused gameplay. True newcomers seeking a conventional entry point into tabletop gaming, or genre purists wanting dedicated setting content, should look elsewhere or approach this system with adjusted expectations. A supplementary "Quickstart for Traditional Players" guide would significantly improve accessibility for my demographic.
