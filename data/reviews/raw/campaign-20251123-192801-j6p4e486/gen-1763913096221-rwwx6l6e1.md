## Narrative Feedback

As someone completely new to tabletop RPGs, I picked up this rulebook with equal parts excitement and trepidation. I'm deeply drawn to method acting in games - I want to fully inhabit my character, feel their emotions, and let the story emerge from authentic roleplay. This rulebook's "fiction-first" philosophy spoke directly to my soul.

The opening chapters about core principles resonated deeply with me. "Fiction First, Mechanics Second" - yes! This is exactly what I was hoping to find. I want to BE my character, not calculate optimal moves. The emphasis on player agency, honest GM presentation, and meaningful failures all align with my evangelical belief that narrative should drive everything.

However, as a complete newbie, I found myself frequently overwhelmed. The book introduces so many concepts - Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, Clocks, Checks with their outcome tiers - and while each is explained clearly enough, keeping track of how they all interact together is daunting. I'm a systems thinker by nature, but this is a LOT of system to integrate at once.

Character creation was particularly challenging. I loved the narrative approach - starting with concept and identity elements before mechanics feels right to me. But when I got to Skills and Proficiencies, the "open list" approach that requires GM collaboration felt intimidating for a newcomer. I don't have enough context to know what's reasonable yet!

The combat chapter worried me. I appreciate that it uses Resolve Clocks instead of hit points - that's more narrative and thematic. But four different combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw), plus positioning, plus Tags, plus Conditions... I'm not sure I could run this smoothly as a player without significant practice.

I want to play in a very specific genre - probably noir mysteries or gothic horror - and while the book claims genre flexibility, most examples feel quite general. I need more concrete genre-specific guidance.

My GM style preference (highly structured scenarios) conflicts somewhat with this system's improvisational nature. The book assumes GMs and players will collaborate fluidly, but I'd prefer more rails to follow while I learn.

Overall, this rulebook captures my fiction-first values beautifully in its philosophy, but the mechanical density may slow my adoption as a brand new player.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Character Creation - Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Open-ended skill/proficiency selection assumes familiarity with RPG conventions

**Impact:** Newbies may struggle to create appropriate custom skills without extensive GM hand-holding

**Location:** Steps 4-5 in Chapter 6

### 2. Combat Basics

**Issue:** Multiple overlapping mechanical systems introduced simultaneously

**Impact:** First-time players may feel overwhelmed trying to track actions, positioning, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks all at once during combat

**Location:** Sections on Core Combat Actions and Positioning

### 3. Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** Insufficient guidance for structured/railroad play styles

**Impact:** Players who prefer more GM-directed experiences may feel unsupported by the highly collaborative framework

**Location:** Chapter 5 overview

### 4. Core Principles

**Issue:** Excellent philosophy but assumes reader already understands why fiction-first matters

**Impact:** New players who don't yet have context for traditional vs. fiction-first play may not fully appreciate the principles

**Location:** Chapter 4 throughout

### 5. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Three distinct tracking systems introduced together

**Impact:** Cognitive load is high for someone still learning basic resolution mechanics

**Location:** Chapter 9


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a thoughtfully designed fiction-first system that would deeply satisfy a method actor's desire for authentic character immersion - if they can get past the learning curve. The philosophy is inspiring and the mechanics genuinely support narrative play. However, for a complete newbie like me, the system density is intimidating. I would need a patient, experienced GM and probably several sessions before I felt comfortable enough to truly inhabit my character rather than constantly referencing rules. The book would benefit from a "Quick Start" section that strips mechanics to bare essentials for first sessions, and more genre-specific example scenarios to help players like me who want clear genre boundaries. Score: 6.5/10 - Beautiful design philosophy, challenging onboarding.
