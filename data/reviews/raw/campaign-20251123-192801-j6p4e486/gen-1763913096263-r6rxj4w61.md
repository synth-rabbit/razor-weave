## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has spent countless hours running games and analyzing systems from a tactical perspective, I find Razorweave's Core Rulebook to be a fascinating study in design philosophy tension. The book's commitment to fiction-first gaming aligns perfectly with my evangelical belief that narrative should drive mechanics - every page reinforces this principle with examples that demonstrate how story creates meaningful moments.

The writing is exceptionally clear. Each chapter builds logically on the previous, and the examples throughout genuinely illuminate the concepts rather than just illustrating them. The character creation flow in Chapter 6 is particularly well-structured, guiding new players through identity-building before mechanical choices. I appreciate how the system encourages collaboration between players and GMs to create custom Skills and Proficiencies.

However, as a Tactician who also needs concrete numbers to plan and optimize, I find myself frustrated by the lack of specific DC benchmarks and outcome probabilities. The system describes difficulty tiers conceptually but doesn't provide enough numerical guidance for me to understand the actual odds of success at different skill levels. When I'm planning a character's approach to a challenge, I need to understand the probability space - not just the narrative consequences.

The attribute spread (2/1/1/0) is elegant but thin. I'd like to see more detailed guidance on how attribute values interact with difficulty thresholds. The partial success mechanic is brilliant narratively but mechanically underspecified - what determines when a partial success applies versus a full success or failure? As someone comfortable with complexity, I can handle more nuance here.

The flexibility this system offers for different play styles genuinely excites me. Chapter 5's treatment of GMless play, duet play, and asynchronous play shows thoughtful design consideration. This genre flexibility will serve groups well across many campaign types.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, Outcomes

**Issue:** Insufficient numerical guidance for difficulty tiers

**Impact:** Tacticians cannot accurately assess risk-reward tradeoffs when planning approaches. Players who need concrete numbers have difficulty optimizing character builds or predicting success probabilities.

**Location:** Core resolution system description

### 2. Chapter 3: How to Use This Rulebook

**Issue:** Missing probability tables or DC benchmarks

**Impact:** GMs must intuit appropriate difficulty without reference points. Inconsistent difficulty calibration across different tables may result. Players cannot meaningfully weigh mechanical choices.

**Location:** Resolution system overview

### 3. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Attribute spread limitations unclear

**Impact:** The 2/1/1/0 spread is described but its mechanical implications are not explored. How does a 2 in Reason compare to a 1 in terms of success rate? This information would help players make informed choices.

**Location:** Step Three: Assign Attributes

### 4. Chapter 4: Core Principles of Play

**Issue:** Partial success triggers undefined

**Impact:** The brilliant partial success mechanic lacks clear criteria for when it applies. This may lead to inconsistent application across different GMs and sessions.

**Location:** Partial Success Is a Core Story Beat section

### 5. Chapter 14-15: Skills System

**Issue:** Skill bonus interaction with difficulty unstated

**Impact:** Skills are described narratively but their mechanical weight in checks is ambiguous. A Tactician needs to understand how skill investment translates to improved outcomes.

**Location:** Skills reference sections


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a thoughtfully designed fiction-first TTRPG that will satisfy narrative-focused players who trust their GM to calibrate challenge appropriately. The writing quality is excellent, the structure is logical, and the design philosophy is coherent and well-communicated.

For Tacticians like myself who combine narrative passion with analytical thinking, the system creates productive tension. I love the fiction-first philosophy but struggle with the lack of mathematical transparency. The system would benefit enormously from an appendix providing probability distributions, DC benchmarks, and guidance on how attribute/skill combinations translate to expected outcomes.

The genre flexibility and multiple play mode support demonstrate mature design thinking. This is not a rigid system - it's a framework that trusts tables to make it their own. That trust is admirable but may frustrate players who want clearer guardrails.

Recommended for groups who prioritize collaborative storytelling over tactical optimization. Tacticians can absolutely enjoy this system but should expect to develop intuition through play rather than upfront analysis. A solid 6.5/10 from my perspective - excellent narrative framework with room for mechanical clarity improvement.
