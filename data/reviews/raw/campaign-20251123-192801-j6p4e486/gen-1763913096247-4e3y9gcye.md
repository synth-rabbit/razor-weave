## Narrative Feedback

As someone who's been GMing and playing for years with a strong storytelling focus, I find this rulebook has some solid bones but struggles to meet my needs in a few key areas.

The fiction-first approach they keep emphasizing sounds promising, but honestly? I'm skeptical. The rulebook says "fiction first" repeatedly, but then throws a lot of mechanical scaffolding at you - Tags, Conditions, Clocks, the 4d6 resolution system, outcome tiers. For someone like me who prefers narrative tools over crunchy mechanics, it feels like the system is trying to have it both ways.

What I do appreciate is the Scene Framer-friendly structure. The guidance on framing scenes, managing pacing, and using Clocks as narrative pressure tools aligns well with how I like to run games. The fronts and factions chapter particularly resonates - I can see myself using those to drive dramatic tension without needing to track a bunch of numbers.

But here's where I struggle: the Skills and Proficiencies chapters are dense. Like, really dense. As a Simplicity Seeker, I was hoping for something more streamlined. Instead, I'm looking at multiple reference tables and lists that feel like they're designed for players who enjoy the mechanical crunch. The fact that there are separate Skills BY ATTRIBUTE and Proficiencies BY DOMAIN suggests a level of complexity that might slow down my scene-focused play style.

The VPC (Virtual Player Character) system is interesting but adds yet another layer to track. For a Hybrid GM/Player like me, I appreciate the flexibility, but it also means more cognitive load during play.

Genre flexibility is another concern. The book presents itself as genre-agnostic with its "generic" Tags and Conditions, but as a Genre-Specific Purist, I find this approach dilutes the thematic power of specific settings. I'd rather have fewer, more evocative tools tailored to a particular genre than a toolkit that tries to cover everything.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Skills System Overview (Chapter 14)

**Issue:** Dense presentation with multiple reference tables

**Impact:** Slows down narrative-focused gameplay; requires frequent lookup during play

**Location:** Skills organized by Attribute structure

### 2. Proficiencies Reference (Chapter 17)

**Issue:** Proficiencies by Domain adds another organizational layer to track

**Impact:** Increases cognitive load for GMs who prefer simpler frameworks

**Location:** Proficiency domains and their cross-references

### 3. Tags, Conditions, Clocks (Chapter 9 and 18)

**Issue:** Three overlapping systems that all modify narrative and mechanical state

**Impact:** While flexible, the interaction between these systems can feel overwhelming for simplicity-focused play

**Location:** Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

### 4. Core Concepts (Chapter 2)

**Issue:** Fiction-first philosophy is stated but mechanical scaffolding dominates later chapters

**Impact:** Creates disconnect between the promised narrative focus and actual play complexity

**Location:** The gap between philosophy (Chapter 2) and implementation (Chapters 14-18)

### 5. Alternative Play (Chapter 26)

**Issue:** VPC system adds complexity for solo/small group play

**Impact:** More tracking overhead for what should be a simpler experience

**Location:** Solo Play with VPC Companions section


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a competent system that tries to bridge narrative and mechanical play. For my particular combination of storytelling focus, scene-framing preference, and desire for simplicity, it partially succeeds but doesn't quite hit the mark.

Strengths: The fronts/factions framework is genuinely useful for creating world pressure. The scene-framing guidance in the GM chapters aligns with how I like to run games. The Clocks mechanic, while adding complexity, does serve as a good narrative countdown tool.

Weaknesses: The Skills and Proficiencies chapters add mechanical weight that conflicts with the stated fiction-first approach. The genre-agnostic design means the Tags and Conditions feel generic rather than evocative. The multiple interlocking systems (Tags + Conditions + Clocks + the resolution system) create more cognitive overhead than I prefer.

My recommendation: Playable, but I'd probably strip out or simplify several subsystems for my table. The core 4d6 resolution and the fronts/Clocks framework are keepers; the detailed Skills/Proficiencies breakdowns are likely to get simplified or ignored in my games. Rating it a 6-7 overall - solid foundation, but more mechanical complexity than my playstyle needs.
