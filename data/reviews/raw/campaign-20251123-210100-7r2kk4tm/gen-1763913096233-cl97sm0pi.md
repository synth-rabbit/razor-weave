## Narrative Feedback

As a long-term GM and systems integrator, I approach this rulebook with appreciation for elegant mechanical frameworks. The Razorweave Core Rulebook succeeds in presenting a cohesive system that respects both narrative flow and mechanical precision - a balance many systems struggle to achieve.

What immediately stands out is the book's structural integrity. The progression from philosophy (Chapters 1-5) through mechanics (Chapters 6-12) to practical application (Chapters 13-26) reflects sound pedagogical thinking. As someone converting away from rigid narrative-first puritanism, I find the system's willingness to integrate mechanics without apology refreshing.

The recently modified chapters deserve particular attention. Chapter 6's character creation process is thorough without being overwhelming - the nine-step framework provides clear scaffolding for new players while remaining flexible enough for experienced ones. The worked examples in this chapter are genuinely helpful, not just token gestures.

Chapter 8's treatment of actions and checks is exceptionally well-designed. The clear distinction between intent and approach, combined with the DC setting framework, gives GMs concrete guidance while preserving meaningful player agency. The margin-of-success system elegantly handles partial success - the mechanical backbone that prevents simple binary outcomes. This is systems design done right.

Chapters 9 and 10 show the most refinement. The Tags/Conditions/Clocks triad is complex, but the book makes the conceptual load manageable through clear examples and consistent application. As a systems integrator, I appreciate the three-layer approach: Tags for situation definition, Conditions for character state, Clocks for narrative momentum. This is more sophisticated than "just roll the dice," but not so heavy as to bury the fiction.

The combat system in Chapter 10 demonstrates particular maturity. The four core action types (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) provide meaningful tactical choices without grid-based accounting. Resolve replaces hit points effectively - it tracks both mechanical durability and narrative resilience simultaneously. The positioning mechanics using Tags feel like a natural extension of the core system rather than bolted-on complexity.

The book's recognition of multiple play modes (group, duet, GMless, solo, asynchronous) is admirable. Unlike many systems that claim modularity, Razorweave actually provides mechanical support for variant play. The GMless and solo rules don't feel like afterthoughts - they're genuine design considerations.

What sets this rulebook apart is its consistency. The core probability framework (4d6, margin-based outcomes) persists throughout. The GMing philosophy in Chapters 21-26 genuinely reflects the system's mechanics rather than contradicting them. The faction system with its standing ladder translates cleanly from mechanical abstraction to table practice.

For long-term play, the advancement system strikes an excellent balance between structure and narrative payoff. Chapter 19's treatment of progression avoids the treadmill of level grind while ensuring that character growth feels earned rather than automatic.

My one reservation: the system demands GMs understand abstraction. Tables comfortable with grid-based tactical combat or strict mechanical simulation may find Razorweave's "resolve how the fiction plays out" approach frustratingly vague. But this is a feature, not a flaw - it's designed for groups comfortable thinking in narrative terms while using mechanics as tools.

For a systems integrator like myself, this rulebook represents genuine innovation. It's not revolutionary - many individual mechanics appear in other systems - but the integration is masterful. The book trusts both GMs and players to think intelligently about fictional causation while providing clear mechanical scaffolding. That's the sweet spot between narrative games and traditional RPGs.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6 - Character Creation

**Issue:** Step-by-step walkthrough could use more guidance on handling contradictory player choices

**Impact:** Groups with conflicting visions during character creation might experience slowdowns or need to improvise resolution procedures

**Location:** The Nine-Step Creation Checklist section

### 2. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** The worked examples use relatively straightforward checks; more complex multi-agent scenarios with mixed outcomes would strengthen understanding

**Impact:** GMs may struggle to adjudicate complex social situations where multiple characters contribute to a single outcome

**Location:** Worked Examples section

### 3. Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** While the conceptual distinction between Tags and Conditions is clear, the practical boundary can blur in improvisation

**Impact:** GMs may inconsistently apply mechanics during fast-paced scenes, creating confusion about when tags vs conditions apply

**Location:** Tags vs. Conditions and Using Tags and Conditions with Checks sections

### 4. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** The interaction between Resolve, Conditions, and positioning requires careful tracking during extended combats

**Impact:** Combat scenes with 4+ opponents can become cognitively demanding, potentially slowing narrative pacing despite mechanical elegance

**Location:** Conditions in Combat and Putting It Together sections

### 5. Chapter 5 - Ways to Play

**Issue:** GMless and solo play rules, while present, receive less mechanical development than group play with GM

**Impact:** Groups attempting these modes may find themselves creating significant house rules to handle situations the core rules don't address

**Location:** GMless Cooperative Play and Solo Play subsections


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a sophisticated, well-integrated system that achieves a difficult balance: mechanics-aware design without mechanical domination. As a systems integrator, I find the internal consistency impressive. The 4d6 framework, Tags/Conditions/Clocks architecture, and resolution approach work together coherently rather than as isolated subsystems.

The book's greatest strength is its willingness to require GMs and players think in abstractions - narrative causation rather than tactical specifics - without sacrificing mechanical clarity. This appeals directly to long-term gaming groups comfortable with system mastery and narrative improvisation simultaneously.

The recently modified chapters (6, 8, 9, 10) show particular polish. Character creation balances thoroughness with accessibility. The check procedure gives GMs concrete guidance while preserving narrative agency. The Tags/Conditions/Clocks framework elegantly handles situation, character state, and momentum. Combat provides tactical meaning without grid accounting.

For experienced groups who appreciate elegant mechanical integration and are comfortable thinking in abstractions, this system excels. It rewards system literacy while remaining accessible to newcomers through good examples and clear structure. The advancement and campaign support materials are genuinely useful rather than generic placeholder content.

Long-term groups will appreciate the depth here. The system supports meaningful character growth, faction play, and campaign momentum through mechanical integration rather than narrative rails. This is a rulebook that supports the kind of long-term, interconnected play that achievers value.

Recommended highly for groups comfortable with moderate mechanical complexity in service of narrative flexibility. Excellent for long-term campaigns where system mastery becomes an asset rather than a barrier.
