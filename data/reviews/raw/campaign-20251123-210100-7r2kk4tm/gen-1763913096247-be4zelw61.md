## Narrative Feedback

As a Tactician who has run countless campaigns across decades of game mastering, I approach this rulebook with an eye for concrete mechanics and strategic depth. The Razorweave Core Rulebook succeeds in what matters most to me: giving me clear, quantifiable rules that support a well-prepared sandbox.

The organization is excellent. I can immediately locate what I need: DC difficulties, action outcomes, mechanical interactions. The progression from concepts through mechanics to reference materials is intuitive and well-indexed. For a system I'm preparing sessions in, this is invaluable.

What impresses me most is how the concrete numbers are built throughout. The 4d6 resolution system, the clock advancement mechanics, the skill difficulty thresholds, the advancement point costs - these are all clearly defined. As someone who appreciates numeric precision, I don't have to guess at how my prepared content will resolve mechanically. The Tags system gives me visual markers I can track at the table. Conditions with clear numerical effects (advantages/disadvantages on checks) let me run a fair, transparent game.

The Prepared Sandbox philosophy aligns perfectly with my approach. I can pre-design locations with Tag sets, prepare NPC stat blocks with clear attributes, set up faction relationships with numerical standing values, and have confidence that my prep will translate directly into play without requiring improvisation of mechanical rulings. Chapters 21-22 on running sessions and campaigns give me the structure I need without constraining my scenario design.

The character creation system offers enough mechanical hooks for interesting builds without overwhelming players. The skill system with proficiency combinations creates tactical depth. The advancement system rewards long-term play with meaningful progression tracking.

I do want more concrete guidance on a few points. The interaction between multiple conditions on a single character could use worked examples. The exact resolution of environmental Tags versus combat Tags during combat sequences needs one additional example scenario. The faction standing system is clear, but a worked example of campaign-long faction pressure resolution would help me model my campaigns better.

As someone converting toward fiction-first principles, I appreciate that this system gives me structure to build story within, rather than asking me to improvise mechanics. The visual cognitive style is well-served by the clear stat blocks, numbered step procedures, and consistent symbolic representations.

The specialized play modes (duet, GMless, solo) feel secondary, which is fine - this is clearly optimized for traditional table play, and that's where my expertise lies. I don't feel the system is compromised by offering alternative modes.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Environment vs Combat Tags distinction could benefit from a worked combat scenario

**Impact:** When preparing tactical encounters, I need clearer rules for how environmental complexity translates into mechanical Tags during combat rounds

**Location:** Environment and Positioning section

### 2. Chapter 12 - Downtime, Recovery, Advancement Overview

**Issue:** Missing worked example of multi-character simultaneous downtime management

**Impact:** When running downtime for a full party with overlapping actions, the mechanics are sound but would benefit from a scenario showing timing and resolution

**Location:** Simultaneous Downtime Activities subsection

### 3. Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, Clocks

**Issue:** Multiple conditions on a single character lacks detailed resolution examples

**Impact:** In tactical scenarios with multiple conditions stacking, I need explicit guidance on how advantages/disadvantages combine

**Location:** Condition Interactions and Resolution section

### 4. Chapter 25 - Factions, Fronts, World Pressure

**Issue:** Campaign-long faction pressure resolution uses abstract narrative language

**Impact:** As a prepared GM, I'd benefit from concrete mechanics showing how faction pressure translates into specific scenario complications over time

**Location:** World Pressure and Faction Actions section

### 5. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, Outcomes

**Issue:** The three outcome system works well but has edge cases in extended sequences

**Impact:** For prepared tactical sequences spanning multiple rounds, I sometimes need explicit ruling on how partial successes interact with initiative and positioning

**Location:** Partial Success and Setback mechanics


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is an outstanding resource for prepared GMs who want mechanical precision paired with narrative flexibility. It delivers concrete numbers, clear procedures, and visual clarity that support sandbox design. As a Tactician and forever GM, I found exactly what I needed: a system that respects my preparation time by translating prep directly into play without requiring constant mechanical improvisation. The skill system, advancement mechanics, faction interactions, and combat procedures are all rock-solid and tactically rich. The book excels at its core mission of providing a focused, mechanically sound system for experienced GMs running traditional table campaigns. My minor requests for additional worked examples don't diminish my assessment that this is one of the most reference-friendly rulebooks I've encountered. This rulebook earns a place on my table and in my campaign prep workflow.
