## Narrative Feedback

As someone who lives and breathes exploration—both as a GM crafting worlds and a player diving into them—I find this rulebook absolutely energizing. The Razorweave Core Rulebook speaks directly to my style: it's built for discovery, surprises, and the kind of emergent gameplay that comes when systems get out of the way and let exploration happen.

What immediately grabbed me is the fiction-first philosophy that actually walks the walk. Unlike systems that claim narrative primacy but then bury you in subsystem mechanics, Razorweave constructs its entire framework around exploration. The progression from foundational concepts through character creation flows like a guided expedition—you're building toward capability, not drowning in options.

The system's pattern-driven structure appeals to my brain deeply. The 4d6 resolution mechanic is refreshingly consistent and transparent. What I particularly love is how Clocks work as mechanical manifestations of exploration pacing. When you're tracking a Progress Clock for uncovering a mystery or a Pressure Clock for a stalking threat, you're not managing abstract mechanics—you're managing the pulse of discovery itself.

Character creation in Chapter 6 strikes the right balance for hybrid GMs/Players like me. Nine steps sounds like a lot, but each step serves the exploration principle. You're not min-maxing attributes; you're defining a character's relationship to the world and their unmet drives. This matters when you're both designing scenarios and inhabiting characters.

However—and here's where my "Needs Concrete Numbers" trait becomes visible—I find myself wanting more explicit guidance on numerical thresholds and mechanical probabilities. When Chapter 8 discusses checks and outcomes, it talks about difficulty frameworks (Average, Hard, Brutal) but doesn't give me precise DC guidelines for how to calibrate encounter difficulty. As someone who runs structured narratives with exploration elements, I need concrete numbers to reliably telegraph challenge levels to my players.

The Skills system in Chapters 14-15 and Proficiencies in 16-17 are well-organized, but the lack of concrete recommendations for skill checks makes it harder to improvise consistent difficulty progressions during play. When a player asks "How hard is it to track these bandits through the Whispering Forest?" I need to know: DC 12? DC 14? The narrative guidance helps, but concrete numerical anchors would let me maintain consistent challenge pacing.

The combat chapter (Chapter 10) excels at describing positioning Tags and environmental mechanics that create exploratory combat spaces. But again, I want to see concrete numerical examples. How many positions matter? What's the engagement distance? The fiction is clear, but the math isn't quantified.

What absolutely works for my Railroad Conductor philosophy is Chapter 21 (Running Sessions). The session structure feels natural—there's enough skeleton to maintain pacing without feeling like I'm forcing players through predetermined beats. The faction system with its standing ladder (Hostile to Honored) is beautifully concrete, which ironically is exactly what I love about it.

The alternative play modes (GMless, solo, asynchronous) feel genuinely supported, unlike systems that pay lip service to variations. This matters for an Explorer who wants to experiment with different table configurations without switching systems entirely.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, Outcomes

**Issue:** Difficulty framework (Average, Hard, Brutal) lacks explicit DC values and numerical guidance for skill checks

**Impact:** Hybrid GMs must interpolate encounter difficulty during play, risking inconsistent challenge pacing that disrupts exploration flow

**Location:** Difficulty Framework and Check Resolution sections

### 2. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** Positioning Tags and engagement mechanics described in narrative terms without explicit range or distance values

**Impact:** GMs improvising exploration-based combat scenarios must guess at meaningful distances, potentially oversimplifying or complicating spatial relationships

**Location:** Positioning and Environment, Combat Range sections

### 3. Chapter 14-15 - Skills Reference

**Issue:** Skill difficulties listed narratively (e.g., 'simple for an expert') rather than with DC anchors

**Impact:** Creates overhead when running exploration scenarios with mixed NPC knowledge levels; harder to telegraph risk to players consistently

**Location:** Skill Difficulty Expectations, Example Checks

### 4. Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, Clocks

**Issue:** Progress Clocks lack recommended segment counts for different exploration paces (quick mysteries vs. multi-session arcs)

**Impact:** Exploration-focused scenarios require manual calibration; four-segment vs. eight-segment vs. twelve-segment Clocks need explicit guidance for narrative scope

**Location:** Clock Structure and Pacing, Segmentation Guidelines

### 5. Chapter 12 - Downtime, Recovery, Advancement

**Issue:** Advancement mechanics mention 'growth triggers' but lack numerical thresholds (sessions played, encounters survived, specific milestones)

**Impact:** Hybrid GMs running episodic exploration campaigns can't reliably predict advancement pacing without trial-and-error

**Location:** Advancement Triggers and Milestone Definition


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is exactly the kind of system I want to run. Its fiction-first foundation aligns perfectly with exploration-driven play, and the mechanical clarity of Clocks and the 4d6 system give me reliable tools to pace discovery. For explorers and hybrid GMs, this is genuinely excellent material.

My feedback revolves around one consistent request: concrete numbers. The rulebook's strength is that it trusts GMs and players to construct their own stories within clear frameworks. But for those of us who need numerical anchors to improvise consistently—especially when running exploration scenarios with variable challenge—explicit DC guidelines, engagement distances, and advancement milestones would transform this from excellent to outstanding.

This system will absolutely become my table's new default for exploration-focused campaigns. The journey through Razorweave rules is itself an exploration of elegant game design. Highly recommended, with the caveat that you'll be adding your own difficulty spreadsheet if you lean toward numerical clarity.
