## Narrative Feedback

As a storyteller who bridges the GM and player experience, I approach this rulebook seeking concrete mechanical anchors that support narrative flow without requiring constant table interpretation. The Razorweave Core Rulebook succeeds brilliantly at this balance, particularly in the revised chapters that introduce DC tables, worked examples, and quick reference sections.

The most significant improvement is the treatment of Difficulty Classes in Chapter 8. The addition of a structured DC table transforms what could be vague guidance into actionable benchmarks. As someone who needs concrete numbers to feel confident making narrative decisions, I appreciate that I now have clear markers: a DC 6 investigation check for "finding obvious clues in a detailed scene" versus a DC 10 for "piecing together subtle patterns." This specificity doesn't diminish storytelling—it liberates it. I can now spend my mental energy on scene framing and character reactions rather than second-guessing difficulty assignments.

The worked examples throughout the book are exceptional. Chapter 6's character creation walkthrough with Kira Valdros uses progressive decision tables that show not just what to choose, but why each choice matters narratively. The consideration tables ("Option Considered | Rejected Because | Selected Because") made me realize how much more useful this pattern is than simple mechanics exposition. This approach honors both the analytical player wanting to understand game logic and the storyteller wanting narrative rationale.

Chapter 9's expanded Quick Reference sections for Tags and Conditions are genuinely useful at the table. I can see these sitting next to my GM notes, answering the "wait, what does Shaken actually prevent?" question without losing the thread of narration. The distinction between Common Tags (environmental/scene-level) and Conditions (character-state) is now immediately clear from the reference format itself.

Chapter 10's Combat Basics benefits enormously from the initiative options quick reference and the worked combat examples. The system previously felt like it could bog down in tracking, but seeing a complete round of play with annotations ("On her turn, Kira declares a Strike against the Thug...") demonstrates that the mechanics move at narrative pace when understood properly. This is exactly the kind of example a hybrid GM/player needs.

Where the book truly shines for my style is the consistent integration of player agency language. Phrases like "declare intent" and "determine approach" appear as bolded concepts throughout, creating a coherent decision tree that players can learn. This isn't just rules—it's a shared language for how we'll play together.

My only minor friction point is that while the quick references are excellent, I sometimes want a full-page "GM Quick Start" that shows a complete simple scene using all the mechanics together (one check with tags affecting it, a condition applied, possibly a clock advanced). The book shows individual pieces beautifully but could benefit from one more integrated example showing how everything connects during actual play.

The flexibility acknowledged in Chapter 5 (Ways to Play) feels earned now. The concrete mechanics support duet play, solo play, and group variants better because we understand the underlying numbers and flow. This wasn't just aspirational design—this is a system that can adapt because the core is now crystal clear.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6 - Character Creation

**Issue:** While the worked example is excellent, some players may feel overwhelmed by nine distinct steps even with clear guidance

**Impact:** Session zero could extend longer than intended; new players might need hand-holding through initial decisions despite clear examples

**Location:** Step One through Step Nine flow, particularly Steps 1-3

### 2. Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** DC table uses narrative ranges ("obvious to anyone careful") alongside numbers—interpretation still requires GM judgment

**Impact:** Two GMs might still assign DC 8 vs DC 9 to the same scenario; the table constrains but doesn't eliminate variance

**Location:** Setting DCs section, DC Table

### 3. Chapter 10 - Combat Basics

**Issue:** The worked examples show tactical positioning well but assume players understand miniatures/grid play, which isn't explicitly required

**Impact:** Theater-of-mind groups might find the examples less applicable; some translation work needed

**Location:** Worked Combat Examples section

### 4. Chapter 9 - Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Issue:** Clock advancement guidance uses phrases like "moderate progress" and "significant progress" which still require GM calibration

**Impact:** Consistency across sessions may vary; GMs with different pacing preferences might advance clocks at different rates

**Location:** Clock Advancement Guide subsection

### 5. Chapters 8-10 Integration

**Issue:** The three chapters (Checks, Tags/Conditions/Clocks, Combat) show mechanics separately but lack a complete scene example showing all mechanics in concert

**Impact:** Hybrid players who understand each piece individually might still struggle to orchestrate them together at the table

**Location:** Chapter transitions between 8-9-10


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook has evolved into something remarkable: a genuinely hybrid rulebook that serves storytellers who need mechanical clarity. The concrete numbers—DC tables, quick references, worked examples—transform vague guidance into playable reality without sacrificing narrative voice or table flexibility.

For a storyteller like me who bridges GM and player perspectives, this book now provides exactly what I need: enough mechanical scaffolding to make confident decisions, but not so much that I'm drowning in subsystems. The added tables and examples in Chapters 6, 8, 9, and 10 are the difference between "this seems interesting but complex" and "I can see how this works and I'm excited to run it."

The system excels at supporting scene framing because the mechanics are clear enough that I can focus on fiction, scene setup, and character consequences rather than table interpretation. The quick references mean less mid-scene page flipping. The worked examples mean new players at my table have a clearer onboarding experience.

This rulebook succeeds because it treats mechanics not as obstacles between story and play, but as enablers of clearer storytelling. That's exactly what converts storytellers like me into system evangelists. Highly recommended for anyone running games at the intersection of narrative and mechanical integrity.
