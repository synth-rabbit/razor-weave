## Narrative Feedback

As someone who appreciates clear mechanical frameworks and precise rule definitions, I find the Razorweave Core Rulebook to be a mixed experience. The system clearly prioritizes narrative flexibility over mechanical precision, which creates both opportunities and frustrations.

**What Works Well:**

The core resolution mechanic (4d6 + modifiers vs DC) is elegantly simple and easy to remember. The DC ladder (12 Easy through 22 Legendary) provides a concrete reference point. The outcome tier system (Critical Success at margin +5, Full Success at 0+, Partial at -1 to -2, Failure at -3 or worse, Critical Failure at -7 or all 1s) gives concrete thresholds to work with.

The Advantage/Disadvantage system is well-defined: +1 Advantage means roll 5d6 keep best 4, +2 means roll 6d6 keep best 4, and they cap at ±2 with clear cancellation rules. This is the kind of precise mechanical framework I can work with.

**What Concerns Me:**

The "fiction first" philosophy, while admirable for storytelling, leaves too much mechanical ambiguity. When the text says "start by imagining what success would look like" for setting DCs, that's subjective guidance, not a procedure. Different GMs will interpret the same situation very differently.

The Resolve Clock system replacing hit points is thematically interesting but mechanically vague. The rulebook says a Full Success on Strike "significantly advances their Resolve," but what does that mean? Two segments? The example with a 6-segment VPC Clock mentions "Full Success ticks 2 segments" almost in passing. This should be a core, prominent rule, not buried in an example.

Combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw) are described conceptually but lack the kind of action economy clarity I'd want. How many of these can I take per turn? The text suggests "one main action" but then adds you can do "something small alongside" if the GM agrees. That's not a rule—that's an invitation to table arguments.

The Skills chapter provides examples rather than exhaustive definitions. While I understand the design intent, this means two tables could interpret the same Skill very differently. The system trusts the table too much and provides too few guardrails.

Advancement is similarly open-ended. "Every few sessions" or "at milestones" are guidelines, not rules. The advancement menu is clear about WHAT you can gain, but HOW MUCH and HOW OFTEN is left to table consensus.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 10: Combat Basics - Resolve Clocks

**Issue:** The damage/tick system for Resolve Clocks is not formally defined. The text mentions Full Success ticks 2 segments only in an example, not as a core rule.

**Impact:** High - Combat resolution will vary wildly between tables without clear tick values.

**Location:** Section: Resolve Instead of Hit Points, Example box

### 2. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, Outcomes - Setting DCs

**Issue:** While the DC ladder is provided (12-22), the guidance for selecting a DC is entirely qualitative ('imagine what success would look like'). No concrete criteria for distinguishing between adjacent tiers.

**Impact:** Medium - Inconsistent difficulty across sessions and GMs.

**Location:** Section: Setting DCs

### 3. Chapter 10: Combat Basics - Turn Structure

**Issue:** Action economy is loosely defined. 'One main action' plus 'something small alongside' lacks the precision needed for tactical play.

**Impact:** Medium - Players will push boundaries on what counts as 'small' actions.

**Location:** Section: Your Turn: Structure and Options

### 4. Chapter 19: Advancement - Timing

**Issue:** Advancement triggers are presented as options (session-based, milestone, downtime) without clear pacing recommendations. 'Every 3-4 sessions' is vague.

**Impact:** Low-Medium - Character power levels may diverge between campaigns.

**Location:** Section: When Advancement Happens

### 5. Chapter 15: Skills Reference

**Issue:** Skills are presented as examples rather than an exhaustive list. No procedure for creating new Skills or validating homebrew additions.

**Impact:** Medium - Table variation in Skill interpretation and scope.

**Location:** Opening paragraph of chapter


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a competent narrative-first RPG system that will appeal to groups who prioritize collaborative storytelling over mechanical rigor. The core dice mechanic is solid and the Advantage/Disadvantage system is well-designed.

However, as a tactically-minded player who values concrete numbers and predictable systems, I find too much of the rulebook relies on table consensus and GM judgment rather than defined procedures. The Resolve Clock system, in particular, needs formalization—combat outcomes should not depend on whether your GM read the one example that mentions tick values.

I rate this system 6/10 for practical usability in my preferred play style. Groups who embrace fiction-first gaming will likely rate it higher. Groups who want tight tactical combat simulation should look elsewhere. The system knows what it wants to be—it just doesn't provide enough mechanical scaffolding for those of us who think better with dice pools than with narrative beats.
