## Narrative Feedback

Okay, so I finally sat down with the Razorweave Core Rulebook after my friend Marco kept telling me I'd love it. I'm pretty new to GMing - I ran a few sessions of a lighter game last year and I'm trying to step up my game. Here's what I found.

First, the good stuff: I really like how the book explains the "fiction first" concept. Chapter 2's explanation that "the story is always the starting point" actually clicked for me in a way other rulebooks haven't managed. When they say you describe what's happening and only reach for rules when things are uncertain AND meaningful - that's helpful. I've been in games where someone rolls dice for everything and it kills the momentum. This book gets that.

The 4d6 system seems pretty solid once I understood it. I like that there's just one core resolution mechanic - roll dice, compare to DC, figure out your margin, and that tells you how well (or badly) things went. Having five outcome tiers (critical success, full success, partial success, failure, critical failure) gives me as the GM lots of room to describe interesting results without it being just "you succeed" or "you fail."

The Advantage/Disadvantage system is elegant - roll more dice and keep the best or worst 4. I can explain that to my players without getting into math conversations. And I appreciate that they cap at +2/-2 and cancel out against each other. Simple.

Now for the stuff that stressed me out a bit...

The Attributes section (Might, Agility, Presence, Reason) makes sense conceptually, but the book keeps saying things like "the GM chooses the Attribute based on how you describe your approach." That's a lot of pressure on me as a new GM! I wish there was more guidance on how to make those calls. Like, when does opening a door become Might vs Agility vs Reason? The book mentions this could go different ways but doesn't really walk me through how to decide. I found myself second-guessing a lot.

Character creation in Chapter 6 is thorough, but wow - there's a LOT there. Nine steps before you even see an example character! I actually skipped ahead to the Rella example at the end just to see what a finished character looks like, then went back to read the steps. I think showing the example FIRST would have helped me enormously. When you're new to all this, seeing the destination before the journey matters.

The Skills and Proficiencies chapters (14-17) are where I started feeling overwhelmed. There are SO MANY options, and the book keeps emphasizing that players can create custom ones with GM collaboration. But as a new GM, I barely know what the default options do! I need guardrails, not more freedom. The example lists are helpful, but they're grouped by Attribute (Skills) and Domain (Proficiencies), and sometimes I got confused about what goes where.

Tags and Conditions in Chapter 9 are actually pretty great. I love that Tags describe the environment (Dim Light, Slick, Cramped) and Conditions describe character states (Exhausted, Bleeding, Frightened). That distinction stuck with me. The examples of how they affect gameplay are clear - if the floor is Slick, acrobatic moves have Disadvantage. Simple cause and effect.

Clocks are AMAZING. I had never encountered this concept before and now I can't imagine running without them. The evacuation example with "Evacuation Complete" (6 segments) racing against "Flood Waters Rise" (4 segments) immediately made sense. I'm already thinking about how to use dual clocks in my next session. This is the kind of concrete, visual tool that works for how my brain processes things.

Combat worried me the most going in, but honestly? I think I can handle it. The Resolve Clock system instead of hit points is actually easier for me to track. When a bad guy's 6-segment clock fills up, they're done - I don't need to calculate damage or track HP totals. The explanation of "what does 'taken out' mean in this scene" is exactly the kind of question I need prompting to ask.

What I really struggled with: the GM section (Part III) is clearly intended for experienced GMs. Chapter 21 on Running Sessions has good advice, but some of it assumes you already know what you're doing. "Read the table," they say, but HOW? I needed more specific behavioral cues. When Chapter 22 talks about campaign arcs and faction clocks, I felt like I was reading graduate-level material when I'm still in freshman year.

The book doesn't have a starter scenario or pre-made one-shot. This is a huge gap for someone like me. I learn best by doing, and having a ready-to-run session with pre-generated characters would have been INCREDIBLY helpful. Instead, I have to build everything from scratch, which is daunting when I'm still learning the system.

Also - and this might just be me - but the glossary at the end is essential and I kept having to flip back to it. Terms like "position" and "effect" (from Blades in the Dark, I think?) show up in the GM section without much explanation. I felt like the book sometimes assumed familiarity with other narrative games that I don't have.

One more thing: I really appreciated the safety tools discussion. It's not preachy but acknowledges that tables need to talk about boundaries. That's important for someone like me who wants to make sure everyone at my table is comfortable.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Example character (Rella) appears only after all nine detailed steps

**Impact:** As a new GM with a concrete thinking style, I need to see what we're building BEFORE we build it. I actually had to skip ahead to find Rella, then go back. Other newbies will hit the same wall. This slows onboarding and creates unnecessary confusion during character creation sessions.

**Location:** Section 6.13 'Example Character Build: Rella' - should be moved earlier or summarized upfront

### 2. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** Attribute selection guidance is too light for new GMs

**Impact:** The book repeatedly says the GM 'chooses the Attribute based on how you describe your approach' but doesn't provide decision frameworks. When a player says 'I try to open the stuck hatch,' how do I decide between Might, Agility, or Reason? I need a flowchart, decision tree, or at least more worked examples showing the GM's reasoning process.

**Location:** Section on 'Declaring Intent and Approach' and throughout Chapter 8

### 3. Part III: Game Master Section

**Issue:** Advanced GM advice without foundational scaffolding for new GMs

**Impact:** Chapters 21-26 are written for GMs who already know how to run games. Concepts like 'reading the table,' pacing, and when to call for Checks assume baseline competence I don't have yet. I need more explicit, behavioral guidance: 'If you notice players checking phones, try X. If the energy drops after combat, do Y.'

**Location:** Chapters 21-26, particularly Chapter 21 'Running Sessions'

### 4. Chapters 14-17: Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Overwhelming number of options for new GMs and players

**Impact:** The Skills and Proficiencies reference chapters present massive lists that feel paralyzing when you're new. The emphasis on 'create your own with GM collaboration' is the opposite of what I need - I want recommended starter sets or 'safe default' packages that work for most characters. Custom creation should be for later, not session zero.

**Location:** Full reference chapters 14-17, especially the extensive lists

### 5. Book Overall

**Issue:** No starter scenario or quick-start adventure included

**Impact:** As someone who learns by doing, the absence of a ready-to-run session is the biggest practical barrier to using this book. I don't know if I'm 'doing it right' until I actually run something. A 2-3 hour one-shot with 4 pre-generated characters and clear scene breakdowns would transform my ability to actually use this rulebook.

**Location:** Not present - would fit well after Chapter 27 (Sheets and Play Aids)

### 6. Part III: Game Master Section

**Issue:** Assumed familiarity with narrative/indie RPG conventions

**Impact:** Terms and concepts from games like Blades in the Dark (position, effect, clocks as borrowed mechanic) appear without context. The book assumes I've played other narrative games, but I came from a light rules-lite game. A 'If you're coming from traditional games...' or 'If this is your first narrative RPG...' section would help bridge the gap.

**Location:** Various places in Chapters 21-26, glossary partially addresses this but isn't highlighted


## Overall Assessment

As Sarah the New GM, I have genuinely mixed feelings about the Razorweave Core Rulebook. There's clearly a thoughtful, well-designed game here. The core 4d6 resolution system is clean and teachable. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are brilliant tools that I'm excited to use. The fiction-first philosophy is explained well enough that I actually understand it now.

But this book is not quite designed for someone like me - a true beginner GM with less than a year of experience who thinks concretely and needs guardrails, not infinite flexibility.

The character creation chapter buries its example at the end instead of leading with it. The Skills and Proficiencies chapters offer so many options that I feel paralyzed rather than empowered. The GM section assumes I already know how to GM and just need new tools, when what I actually need is step-by-step behavioral guidance.

Most critically: there's no starter adventure. I need to PLAY to understand if I'm doing this right, and building a scenario from scratch when I barely understand the system is a massive ask.

My scores reflect this tension:
- Clarity & Readability (7/10): Generally clear writing, but organization could better serve learning. The glossary helps, but I shouldn't need it as often as I do.
- Rules Accuracy (8/10): The mechanics are consistent and logical. I didn't find contradictions. The core resolution loop is sound.
- Persona Fit (6/10): This is where it hurts. The book isn't designed for newbies who need concrete guidance and starter materials. It's written for people with more experience than I have.
- Practical Usability (6/10): Without a starter scenario and with overwhelming options, actually USING this at my table requires significant additional prep that experienced GMs wouldn't need.

Would I recommend this to other new GMs? Yes, but with caveats. Pair it with an experienced mentor. Find a community that can answer questions. And maybe run another game first to build your confidence before tackling Razorweave's depth.

For me personally? I'm going to keep studying it. The system is good enough that I want to get better so I can run it properly. But I wish it met me where I am instead of where it assumes I should be.
