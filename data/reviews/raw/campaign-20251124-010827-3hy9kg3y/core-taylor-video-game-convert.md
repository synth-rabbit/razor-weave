## Narrative Feedback

As someone coming from video games where I know exactly what my stats do and can see precise damage numbers, this rulebook is asking me to embrace a lot of ambiguity that I am not used to. The 'fiction first' approach keeps being emphasized but I still do not fully understand when I should roll dice versus when the GM just decides what happens.

The core mechanic of 4d6 plus Attribute versus a DC is pretty clear - that part I can work with. But the attribute values of 0-2 feel tiny compared to video games where I might have 50 Strength. I get that it is a different scale, but it took me a while to understand that a +2 is actually exceptional.

The Resolve Clock system instead of hit points is interesting but confusing. In a video game, when I deal 50 damage I know exactly how close the enemy is to death. Here, the GM ticks a clock based on... what exactly? The fiction? It feels like the GM has too much discretion for someone who wants to strategize.

I appreciate that the Skills can pair with different Attributes depending on approach - that is actually kind of like a video game build where you can lean into different playstyles. But the Proficiency system is vague. Sometimes it gives Advantage, sometimes it lowers the DC, sometimes it lets you skip rolling entirely. I need a clear flowchart, not narrative permission.

The character creation chapter is decent for following steps, but the mechanical payoff feels uncertain. I want to know: if I put my 2 in Agility, exactly how much better will I be at combat? The book keeps telling me it depends on the fiction and the GM.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 7: Characters and Attributes

**Issue:** Attribute scale feels too compressed for meaningful differentiation

**Impact:** Players from video game backgrounds expect larger numerical spreads to feel character power differences

**Location:** Section: Attribute Ratings Scale (0-2 range)

### 2. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Resolve Clock system lacks concrete damage numbers

**Impact:** Cannot calculate optimal strategies or predict combat outcomes reliably

**Location:** Section: Resolve Instead of Hit Points

### 3. Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

**Issue:** When to roll criteria too subjective

**Impact:** Three conditions (Uncertainty, Consequence, Agency) feel like GM judgment calls, not rules

**Location:** Section: When to Roll (and When Not To)

### 4. Chapter 16: Proficiencies System Overview

**Issue:** Mechanical benefit of Proficiencies inconsistent

**Impact:** Cannot plan character builds when Proficiency effects vary by situation

**Location:** Section: Proficiencies, Skills, and Attributes

### 5. Chapter 14: Skills System Overview

**Issue:** Same Skill pairing with different Attributes creates uncertainty

**Impact:** Hard to optimize character when the GM chooses which Attribute applies

**Location:** Section: Skills and Attributes


## Overall Assessment

This rulebook is clearly written for people who are comfortable with narrative-heavy tabletop RPGs, not for someone like me who wants clear mechanical systems I can master. The 4d6 core mechanic is approachable, and I appreciate the structured character creation steps. However, the constant emphasis on 'fiction first' and GM discretion makes me feel like my character build choices might not matter as much as in a video game. I need more tables, more numbers, and more certainty about what my mechanical choices actually do. The Resolve Clock combat system is the biggest departure from what I know - I want to calculate DPS and see health bars, not watch the GM decide when a clock ticks. That said, the book is honest about what kind of game it is. It just might not be the kind of game I was hoping for unless I really commit to the narrative style.
