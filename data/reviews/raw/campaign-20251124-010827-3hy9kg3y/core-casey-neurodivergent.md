## Narrative Feedback

As Casey, a pattern-driven puzzle solver with early intermediate experience, I approached this rulebook looking for clear, consistent systems I could internalize and apply.

**What Works Well for My Brain:**

The 4d6 resolution system is elegantly consistent - I appreciate that every check follows the same procedure. The margin-based outcome tiers (Critical Success +5, Full Success 0+, Partial Success -1 to -2, Failure -3 or worse, Critical Failure -7 or worse) create a predictable pattern I can internalize. This is exactly the kind of systematic structure that helps me feel confident at the table.

The Advantage/Disadvantage system caps at +/-2 with clear dice-keeping mechanics (roll extra d6, keep best/worst 4). The cancellation rules are logical and don't require me to track complex modifier stacks. This pattern-based approach lets me focus on the fiction rather than arithmetic.

The DC ladder (12 Easy, 14 Routine, 16 Tough, 18 Hard, 20 Heroic, 22 Legendary) is memorable and consistent. I can mentally anchor these numbers and quickly assess task difficulty.

**Challenges I Encountered:**

The 'fiction first' philosophy creates some cognitive load for me. While I appreciate the design intent, I sometimes find myself wanting more explicit rules for when to roll versus when not to roll. The three-part test (Uncertainty + Consequence + Agency) helps, but I would benefit from more edge case examples showing exactly where the boundaries are.

The open-ended nature of Skills and Proficiencies feels overwhelming. I understand the flexibility is intentional, but I struggle without a canonical list to reference. The rulebook provides examples, but I keep wanting a definitive 'these are THE Skills' document. This is a system designed for negotiation with the GM, which requires social bandwidth I'd rather spend elsewhere.

Tags and Conditions are conceptually clear (Tags = environment/situation, Conditions = character state), but the lack of an exhaustive mechanical reference in the main chapters means I need to flip between sections frequently. The promise of Chapter 18 having extended references is helpful, but I'd prefer inline quick-reference tables.

**Pattern Recognition Notes:**

I notice the Intent + Approach pattern appears consistently throughout. This is a learnable structure: state what you want, describe how you're doing it, GM determines if roll needed and which Attribute applies. This predictability helps me engage confidently.

The book's structure follows a logical progression (concepts -> characters -> resolution -> reference), which my brain appreciates. I can build mental models layer by layer.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 6 - Skills and Proficiencies

**Issue:** Open-ended lists without canonical references create decision paralysis

**Impact:** High cognitive load during character creation; uncertainty about whether custom choices are appropriately scoped

**Location:** Step Four: Choose Skills and Step Five: Choose Proficiencies

### 2. Chapter 8 - When to Roll

**Issue:** The three-part test is helpful but edge cases remain ambiguous

**Impact:** I need more worked examples showing borderline situations where the GM might or might not call for a roll

**Location:** When to Roll (and When Not To) subsection

### 3. Chapter 9 - Tags Reference

**Issue:** Common Tags are listed but exhaustive mechanical effects are deferred to Chapter 18

**Impact:** Requires context-switching during play; I prefer inline quick-reference tables

**Location:** Common Tag Categories subsection

### 4. Chapter 3 - How to Use This Rulebook

**Issue:** Keyboard shortcuts section is excellent but buried mid-chapter

**Impact:** This navigation aid should be more prominent for readers who process information non-linearly

**Location:** Keyboard Shortcuts subsection

### 5. Character Creation Flow

**Issue:** Nine-step process is clear but feels lengthy

**Impact:** Would benefit from a one-page visual flowchart summary for quick reference during session zero

**Location:** Step One through Step Nine

## Overall Assessment

This rulebook demonstrates thoughtful, systematic design that largely aligns with my pattern-driven learning style. The 4d6 + margin resolution system, consistent DC ladder, and structured Advantage/Disadvantage mechanics create predictable patterns I can internalize.

The 'fiction first' design philosophy works well once you understand it, but the upfront cognitive investment is substantial. As a puzzle solver, I appreciate systems I can optimize within - but this system intentionally resists optimization in favor of narrative flexibility. This is philosophically sound but occasionally frustrating when I want clear answers.

My primary challenges center on the open-ended nature of Skills/Proficiencies and the distributed placement of reference material. I would strongly benefit from consolidated quick-reference sheets, canonical skill lists (even if marked as 'examples'), and more explicit boundary cases in the resolution rules.

Overall, this is a well-structured rulebook that rewards patient reading and re-reading. For neurodivergent players like myself who thrive on pattern recognition, the core mechanics are satisfyingly consistent. The flexibility that some find liberating requires extra scaffolding for me to navigate confidently. Score: 7.5/10 average, with room to improve through better reference consolidation.
