## Narrative Feedback

As a solo player who's spent years exploring narrative-driven games, I find this rulebook hits many of the right notes for immersive, fiction-first play. The text repeatedly emphasizes that story comes first and mechanics support the narrative - this resonates deeply with how I approach games.

The modular structure works well for exploration-focused play. I appreciate that the system doesn't force a linear path through the rules. The emphasis on 'what happens next?' as the core question aligns perfectly with the experimental, discovery-oriented mindset I bring to the table.

However, as someone who primarily plays solo or GMless, I found the material weighted heavily toward traditional GM-led play. Chapter 26 on Alternative Play mentions solo play, but I needed to hunt for it. The core loop seems designed around the GM presenting situations and players responding - workable for solo play, but requiring adaptation.

The fiction-first principles shine throughout. The examples show characters acting in the world first, with mechanics emerging from fictional positioning. This is exactly how I want to engage with a system - not as a game to be optimized, but as a framework for discovery.

The Clocks and Tags system offers rich potential for solo play - I can see using Clocks to simulate world pressure without a GM. But the guidance for doing so independently is thin. I found myself mentally translating 'the GM decides' into 'I'll use an oracle or make a judgment call' repeatedly.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Chapter 5: Ways to Play the Game

**Issue:** Solo play mentioned but not deeply supported

**Impact:** Solo players must do significant adaptation work to use the core systems independently

**Location:** Ways to Play section - Alternative Play referenced but details in later chapter

### 2. Chapter 26: Alternative Play

**Issue:** Alternative play chapter buried in GM section

**Impact:** Solo players and GMless groups may not discover relevant guidance until deep into reading

**Location:** Part III placement - requires reading through GM-focused content first

### 3. Core Resolution System

**Issue:** GM-centric language throughout Check resolution

**Impact:** Every Check description assumes a GM is present to adjudicate, complicating solo interpretation

**Location:** Chapters 8 and throughout - persistent GM references in resolution

### 4. Tags and Conditions System

**Issue:** Tag creation guidance assumes GM authority

**Impact:** Solo players need additional guidance for when and how to apply Tags independently

**Location:** Chapter 9 and Chapter 18 - Tag application rules

### 5. Exploration and Social Play

**Issue:** Discovery mechanics assume GM-controlled revelations

**Impact:** Explorer playstyle hindered when GM controls all unknown elements

**Location:** Chapter 11 - exploration procedures rely on GM revealing information


## Overall Assessment

The Razorweave Core Rulebook is a solid fiction-first system that will serve many tables well. For experienced players like myself who value narrative emergence and experimental play, the core principles align beautifully with how we approach games.

My main concern is accessibility for solo and GMless play. The system's bones would support solo play admirably - the Clock system, narrative positioning, and flexible outcome tiers all translate well to independent play. But the text assumes a GM at nearly every turn, requiring solo players to do translation work that could be better supported.

For traditional group play with a GM, I'd rate this higher. For my primary mode of solo exploration, the adaptation burden brings down practical usability. I'd love to see a dedicated solo play companion or expanded Chapter 26 content.

Rating Summary: Clarity (8) - well-organized and readable. Rules Accuracy (8) - internally consistent system. Persona Fit (7) - fiction-first philosophy matches, but GM-centric structure doesn't. Practical Usability (6) - requires significant adaptation for my playstyle.
