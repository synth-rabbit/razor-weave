## Narrative Feedback

As a busy parent who gets maybe one evening a week to game, I found this rulebook to be a mixed experience. Let me break it down:

**What Works:**
The 'Fiction First' philosophy really speaks to me - I do not want to spend my precious gaming time arguing about rules minutiae. The book makes it clear that story comes first, which means I can focus on having fun rather than memorizing every detail. The Core Concepts chapter (Chapter 2) is a nice quick overview that helps me get oriented.

The 'When to Roll (and When Not To)' section is genuinely helpful. I appreciate that the game tells me NOT to roll for every little thing - only when there is uncertainty, consequence, and agency. That keeps things moving, which is critical when my gaming sessions might get interrupted by kids needing something.

The Resolve Clock system instead of hit points is elegant. Visual trackers are easier to manage than tracking numbers, and my brain appreciates anything that reduces bookkeeping.

**What Struggles:**
This book is MASSIVE - over 50,000 words according to my estimate. As someone who cannot sit down and read for hours, the sheer length is intimidating. While the book says I can start playing after Chapters 1-6, that is still a lot to absorb. I wish there was a 'Quick Start' one-pager that summarized the absolute essentials.

The character creation process has nine steps. Nine! Each step references other chapters, which means a lot of page-flipping. For someone with limited time, this feels overwhelming. I would love a streamlined 'first character' guide that gets me playing in 20 minutes.

The four Attributes (Might, Agility, Presence, Reason) plus Skills plus Proficiencies creates a lot of moving parts to track. I found myself having to re-read sections to understand how they all connect. A simple diagram showing the relationship between Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies would help tremendously.

The combat chapter, while well-written, introduces concepts like Maneuvers, Set Ups, and multiple action types. For casual play, this feels like more complexity than I need. Where is the 'simple combat' option?

**Bottom Line:**
This is clearly a well-crafted system with strong design principles. The fiction-first approach and flexible play styles (including solo play) are great for my lifestyle. However, the depth and breadth of content makes it hard to just pick up and play. I would need to invest significant time upfront to feel confident running or playing in a game - time I do not always have.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Book Length and Structure

**Issue:** The 52,000+ word rulebook is overwhelming for time-constrained readers

**Impact:** Players like me may never get past the initial chapters before giving up

**Location:** Overall document structure

### 2. Chapter 6: Character Creation

**Issue:** Nine-step character creation process with many cross-references

**Impact:** First-time character creation could take 1-2 hours, which is my entire available gaming window

**Location:** id="ch-06-character-creation"

### 3. Quick Start / Onboarding

**Issue:** No dedicated quick-start guide or one-page rules summary

**Impact:** New players must read multiple full chapters before feeling ready to play

**Location:** Chapters 1-6

### 4. Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Issue:** Combat introduces many concepts (Resolve, Maneuvers, Set Ups, Actions) at once

**Impact:** Casual players may feel overwhelmed during first combat encounters

**Location:** id="ch-10-combat-basics"

### 5. Visual Aids and Diagrams

**Issue:** Lack of visual summaries showing how Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies connect

**Impact:** Understanding the mechanical relationships requires re-reading text multiple times

**Location:** Chapters 7-8


## Overall Assessment

For a Casual Gamer with 1-3 years of experience who values simplicity, this rulebook presents a solid system wrapped in too much documentation. The core design philosophy (fiction-first, collaborative play, flexible stakes) aligns well with casual play preferences. However, the execution demands more upfront investment than a time-constrained player like me can easily provide.

**Recommendation:** The system itself would rate higher if paired with a condensed 'Essentials' document. As it stands, I would need a more experienced player to teach me the game rather than learning from the book alone. Rating it 6.5/10 overall - good bones, needs better scaffolding for casual players.
