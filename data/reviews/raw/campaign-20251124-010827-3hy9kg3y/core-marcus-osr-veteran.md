## Narrative Feedback

As someone who has run dungeon crawls and OSR games for nearly two decades, I approach this rulebook with a very specific lens: does it give me concrete, reliable procedures I can run at the table without ambiguity?

The 4d6 core resolution system is interesting - roll 4d6, add Attribute and bonuses, compare to DC (12-22 ladder), and derive margin for outcome tiers. That is mechanical enough that I can work with it. The Advantage/Disadvantage system (roll 5d6 or 6d6, keep best/worst 4) with a cap at plus or minus 2 is clean and predictable.

However, my skepticism about fiction-first design is not assuaged. The book repeatedly emphasizes that "fiction comes first" and mechanics "support the story." This philosophy concerns me because it places enormous weight on GM adjudication for when to call for checks, what DCs to set, and how to interpret Tags and Conditions. For an experienced GM, this flexibility might be welcome. For consistent, reliable play, it introduces variance that depends entirely on the GM's judgment.

The DC ladder (12 Easy, 14 Routine, 16 Tough, 18 Hard, 20 Heroic, 22 Legendary) is helpful, but the guidance for when to apply which DC is vague - "imagine what success would look like" and "use lower DCs when characters have strong fictional positioning." What does "strong fictional positioning" mean in concrete terms? How do I know if a character has it?

Tags and Conditions are essentially narrative flags that grant Advantage/Disadvantage or modify DCs. While the concept is sound, the implementation feels too loose. The book says Tags "typically" do certain things but provides no authoritative list of what each Tag mechanically does. Dim Light "might impose Disadvantage" - might? I need to know definitively.

The Clock system is the strongest mechanical element. It provides concrete tracking for multi-stage challenges and racing threats. I can use this at the table with confidence.

Combat actions (Strike, Defend, Move, Set Up, Withdraw) are clearly defined, which I appreciate. But the lack of initiative rules and the vague guidance on when to "zoom in" to structured combat versus handling it through conversation leaves too much to GM fiat.

Character creation is solid procedurally - concept first, then Attributes (2/1/1/0 spread), Skills (rank 0-3), Proficiencies, and gear. This is a workable framework.

Overall, this is a competent modern narrative-leaning system that will frustrate GMs who want authoritative rulings over rulings-at-the-table philosophy. The mechanical bones are there, but they are wrapped in too much "collaborative storytelling" language that undermines the referee role I prefer.

## Issue Annotations

### 1. Core Resolution (Chapter 8)

**Issue:** DC setting guidance is insufficiently precise

**Impact:** GMs must improvise difficulty for every situation without clear benchmarks beyond abstract difficulty labels

**Location:** Setting DCs section - 'Start by imagining what success would look like'

### 2. Tags and Conditions (Chapter 9)

**Issue:** Tags lack definitive mechanical effects

**Impact:** 'Dim Light might impose Disadvantage' - ambiguous language creates inconsistent rulings across sessions

**Location:** What Tags Do section - 'Tags typically grant Advantage or Disadvantage'

### 3. Combat Basics (Chapter 10)

**Issue:** No explicit initiative or turn order procedure

**Impact:** Groups must invent their own turn structure, leading to potential disputes about action timing

**Location:** Combat Basics chapter - no initiative section found

### 4. When to Roll (Chapter 4)

**Issue:** Over-reliance on GM judgment for check triggers

**Impact:** 'A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain' places subjective assessment at the core of resolution

**Location:** Fiction First, Mechanics Second section

### 5. Skills System (Chapter 14-15)

**Issue:** Skill bonuses not clearly quantified in core resolution

**Impact:** The relationship between Skill ranks (0-3) and check bonuses is not explicitly stated in the resolution chapter

**Location:** Actions, Checks, and Outcomes - skill bonus calculation unclear


## Overall Assessment

Razorweave presents a mechanically coherent resolution system (4d6+Attribute vs DC, with Advantage/Disadvantage modifiers and five outcome tiers) wrapped in a fiction-first philosophy that will appeal to narrative-focused groups but frustrate traditional GMs seeking authoritative procedures.

Strengths: Clean dice mechanics, well-defined Attribute spread, clear outcome tier definitions, solid Clock system for complex challenges, and comprehensive character creation steps.

Weaknesses: Excessive reliance on GM judgment for when mechanics apply, vague Tag/Condition effects, missing initiative procedures, and DC-setting guidance that prioritizes fictional interpretation over concrete benchmarks.

For my style of play - where the GM serves as neutral referee interpreting a consistent world - this system requires significant house-ruling to tighten the mechanical frameworks. The bones are good, but the flesh is too soft for reliable, reproducible rulings.

Rating: Serviceable for narrative groups, requires modification for traditional play. 5.75/10 overall.
