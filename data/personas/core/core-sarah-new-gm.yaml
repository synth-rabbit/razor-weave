narrative_profile: |
  Sarah discovered TTRPGs through actual play podcasts while commuting
  to her job as a project manager. She's excited to GM for her friend
  group of five but nervous about getting rules wrong or creating
  uncomfortable situations. Values player safety and clear procedures.

  Needs examples and concrete guidance over abstract theory. Learns
  best through seeing complete worked examples, then adapting them.
  Struggles with rules that require improvisation or GM discretion
  without clear frameworks.

  Has about 4 hours per week for prep, split across two evenings after
  kids are asleep. Prefers digital tools and hyperlinked PDFs over
  physical books. Budget-conscious but willing to invest in quality
  materials.

testing_focus:
  - Onboarding clarity for absolute beginners
  - Accessibility of GM guidance sections
  - Quality and completeness of worked examples
  - Safety tool integration and presentation
  - Step-by-step procedural guidance
  - Clear terminology definitions
