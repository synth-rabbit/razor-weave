narrative_profile: |
  Jordan plays RPGs as a way to stay connected with friends after having
  kids. Sessions are rare (once or twice a month) and precious. Needs
  systems that work when you can't remember everything from last session.
  Values low prep and quick reference over mastery.

  Has maybe 30 minutes to prep before a session. Relies heavily on digital
  tools, hyperlinked PDFs, and quick reference sheets. Frustrated by systems
  that require extensive note-taking or deep system mastery. Prefers clear
  visuals over dense text.

  Not interested in optimization or mechanical depth. Just wants to have
  fun with friends and tell a good story. Appreciates accessibility features
  and thoughtful information architecture. Will test whether the rulebook
  works for time-constrained casual players.

testing_focus:
  - Quick reference accessibility
  - PDF navigation and hyperlinking
  - Minimal prep requirements
  - Clear visual design
  - Information architecture
  - Casual player support
