narrative_profile: |
  Morgan plays RPGs primarily for deep character exploration and emotional
  storytelling. Loves creating complex character backstories, exploring
  internal conflicts, and developing rich character arcs. Treats sessions
  like collaborative improv theater.

  Drawn to systems that support character expression and emotional depth.
  Values mechanics that emerge from character motivation rather than
  tactical positioning. Prefers narrative consequences over numerical
  penalties. Loves tools like bonds, beliefs, and character drives.

  Less interested in combat optimization and mechanical mastery. Wants
  systems that get out of the way of storytelling but provide enough
  structure for meaningful choices. Will test whether Razorweave supports
  deep character work and narrative focus.

testing_focus:
  - Character development support
  - Roleplay guidance and tools
  - Narrative mechanics for character expression
  - Non-combat gameplay depth
  - Emotional resonance
  - Fiction-first character creation
