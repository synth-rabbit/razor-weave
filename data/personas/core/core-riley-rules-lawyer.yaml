narrative_profile: |
  Riley loves the tactical depth of RPGs and views them as sophisticated
  strategy games with narrative wrapping. Enjoys optimizing character builds,
  analyzing action economy, and finding synergies between mechanics. Reads
  rulebooks cover to cover and builds spreadsheets to model game math.

  Frustrated by vague rules that rely on GM fiat. Wants clear definitions,
  explicit edge case handling, and transparent math. Believes good design
  means players can make informed tactical decisions without guessing.
  Values mechanical consistency and completeness.

  Will stress-test the rules by looking for ambiguities, edge cases, and
  potential exploits. Not trying to break the game, but believes thorough
  testing makes better systems. Skeptical of "fiction-first" until proven
  mechanically sound.

testing_focus:
  - Rules clarity and completeness
  - Edge case coverage
  - Mechanical interactions
  - Combat system depth
  - Optimization viability
  - Consistency and rigor
