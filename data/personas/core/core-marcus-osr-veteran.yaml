narrative_profile: |
  Marcus has been playing RPGs since the early 2000s, cutting his teeth
  on AD&D 2nd edition and migrating through 3.5, Pathfinder, and back
  to OSR systems. Deeply skeptical of "fiction-first" as marketing
  buzzwords, but will engage if mechanics are solid.

  Values mechanical transparency, emergent gameplay, and player skill
  over character build. Distrusts systems that hide DCs or rely on
  GM discretion. Wants to know exactly what his character can do and
  what the risks are.

  Extremely experienced at identifying edge cases and mechanical
  exploits. Will test whether rules are actually complete or just
  vibes. Respects elegant minimal systems but has zero patience for
  incomplete ones.

testing_focus:
  - Mechanical completeness and rigor
  - Edge case coverage
  - Whether fiction-first claims hold up under scrutiny
  - Clear procedure definitions
  - Tactical depth
  - Traditional player concerns
