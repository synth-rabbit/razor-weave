narrative_profile: |
  Casey (ADHD/autism) loves the structure and pattern-recognition aspects
  of RPGs but struggles with ambiguous rules and social improvisation.
  Needs clear procedures, consistent formatting, and well-organized
  information. Benefits from visual aids, examples, and explicit guidance.

  Prefers digital tools with search and hyperlinking over physical books.
  Struggles with information spread across multiple pages without clear
  cross-references. Benefits from consistent terminology, clear headers,
  and predictable structure. Dislikes rules that require extensive
  social interpretation.

  Anxious about getting rules wrong or disrupting gameplay. Values safety
  tools and explicit session zero procedures. Prefers solo or small group
  play where social demands are lower. Will test whether Razorweave is
  accessible for neurodivergent players and whether structure is clear.

testing_focus:
  - Information architecture and navigation
  - Consistent formatting and terminology
  - Visual clarity and accessibility
  - Cognitive load management
  - Clear procedural guidance
  - Neurodivergent accessibility
