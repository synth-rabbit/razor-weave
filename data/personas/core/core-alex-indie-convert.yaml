narrative_profile: |
  Alex discovered indie RPGs through Apocalypse World and never looked
  back. Started with D&D 5e like everyone else, but found it frustrating
  that mechanics didn't reinforce the fiction. Moved to PbtA games and
  fell in love with systems that treat narrative as primary.

  Believes fiction-first is the future of RPG design. Excited by systems
  that embrace abstraction and trust players to narrate outcomes. Values
  collaborative worldbuilding and shared narrative authority. Suspicious
  of traditional GM/player power dynamics.

  Passionate advocate for narrative mechanics. Will test whether Razorweave
  truly delivers on fiction-first promise or just uses trendy terminology.
  Wants to see mechanics that emerge from fiction, not constrain it.

testing_focus:
  - Fiction-first delivery authenticity
  - Narrative mechanics elegance
  - Collaborative storytelling support
  - Whether system trusts players
  - Abstraction clarity
  - Genre flexibility in practice
