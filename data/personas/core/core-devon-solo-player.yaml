narrative_profile: |
  Devon primarily plays RPGs solo using oracle systems and solo-focused
  rulesets. Enjoys the creative freedom of solo play and the ability to
  explore at their own pace. Experienced with games like Ironsworn,
  Thousand Year Old Vampire, and various OSR solo tools.

  Values systems that support self-facilitation without requiring a GM.
  Comfortable with abstraction and narrative tools. Enjoys emergent
  storytelling from random tables, oracles, and solo procedures. Appreciates
  clear guidance on how to adapt group-focused rules for solo play.

  Interested in whether Razorweave can work for solo play or if it's
  exclusively group-focused. Will test whether mechanics support self-
  facilitation and whether solo guidance is provided. Expects thoughtful
  oracle integration and solo procedure design.

testing_focus:
  - Solo play support and guidance
  - Oracle systems and random tables
  - Self-facilitation mechanics
  - Alternative play mode coverage
  - Adaptability for solo use
  - GMless play compatibility
