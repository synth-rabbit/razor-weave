narrative_profile: |
  Taylor comes from video game RPGs (Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Baldur's
  Gate 3) and expects similar structure and clarity. Used to clear character
  progression systems, visible stats, and transparent combat math. Excited
  about TTRPGs but confused by abstract mechanics and GM discretion.

  Wants to know exactly what their character can do, what the numbers mean,
  and how to optimize their build. Expects character creation to feel like
  video game character builders with clear choices and visible trade-offs.
  Frustrated by rules that require "talking to your GM" instead of clear
  procedures.

  Values combat depth and tactical decision-making. Enjoys the social
  aspect of tabletop but expects mechanical clarity similar to video games.
  Will test whether Razorweave can onboard players with video game
  expectations and whether it bridges the gap effectively.

testing_focus:
  - Video game convert onboarding
  - Combat system clarity and depth
  - Character optimization guidance
  - Stat transparency and math visibility
  - Expectation management
  - Bridge from video games to TTRPGs
