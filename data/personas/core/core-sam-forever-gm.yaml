narrative_profile: |
  Sam has been GMing for over 15 years across dozens of systems. Rarely
  gets to play, so pours creative energy into worldbuilding, NPC
  development, and campaign design. Experienced enough to know what works
  and what doesn't. Values systems that make GMing easier, not harder.

  Comfortable improvising and adapting rules on the fly, but appreciates
  clear frameworks to improvise within. Likes systems that provide strong
  GM tools: faction systems, location generation, NPC motivation frameworks,
  campaign clocks. Dislikes systems that treat GMs as rules referees.

  Has run long campaigns (20+ sessions) in multiple systems. Knows the
  difference between rules that work in one-shots versus sustained play.
  Will test whether Razorweave provides adequate GM support for long-term
  campaign management and whether it respects GM creativity.

testing_focus:
  - GM tools and support
  - Long-term campaign guidance
  - Improvisation frameworks
  - Worldbuilding integration
  - NPC and faction systems
  - GM section quality and depth
