  "summary": "All four chapters are well-written and follow the style guides closely. The content successfully implements the improvement plan: Chapter 06 has the quick-start box, suggested skills/proficiencies tables, and three example characters; Chapter 08 has comprehensive DC and outcome tier tables with the Edge/Burden quick reference; Chapter 09 has detailed common tags tables and clock advancement guidance with a worked opposing clocks example; Chapter 10 has the Resolve Clock comparison, initiative options table, and two detailed worked combat examples. Voice is consistently second-person and instructive. Terminology is consistent throughout (GM, Check, DC, Edge, Burden, Tags, Conditions, Clocks). The few issues identified are minor hyphenation and formatting suggestions that do not affect readability or accuracy. Approved for the next phase."
