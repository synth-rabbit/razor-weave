# Iteration 1 Notes

## Post-Validation Fixes

Applied after validation approval:

1. **VPC Definition** - Added inline definition on first use in Chapter 10:
   - "VPC (Vital Player Character—a significant NPC)"
   - Location: 10-combat-basics.md, line 21

2. **Rella's Skills Consistency** - Fixed inconsistency in Chapter 06:
   - Changed "Analysis" to "Machinery Handling" in Example Characters section
   - Now matches the step-by-step example at line 131
   - Location: 06-character-creation.md, line 300

## Template Observation

**Chapter 09 (Tags, Conditions, Clocks) as Reference Content Template**

Chapter 09 showed the strongest improvement (+0.74 average delta, +1.01 persona_fit). The patterns that worked well:

1. **Categorized Quick-Reference Tables**
   - Environmental Tags, Situational Tags, Atmospheric Tags
   - Each with: Tag name, Typical Effect, Common Sources

2. **Clock Advancement Guide**
   - Clear outcome-to-effect mapping table
   - Multi-Clock decision guidance
   - ASCII decision flowchart

3. **Worked Opposing Clocks Example**
   - Named clocks with segment counts
   - Round-by-round progression
   - Check details with DC and margin
   - Clear outcome showing which clock filled first

These patterns can be applied to future reference-heavy chapters (equipment, abilities, advancement) to improve practical usability and persona fit.
