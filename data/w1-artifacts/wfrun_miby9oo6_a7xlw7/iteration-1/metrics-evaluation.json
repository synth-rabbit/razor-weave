  "approved": true,
  "reasoning": "The modifications achieved substantial improvements across all dimensions. Overall score improved from 6.9 to 7.5 (+0.6), exceeding the +0.3 approval threshold. All four targeted dimensions showed meaningful improvement: clarity_readability +0.8, rules_accuracy +0.3, persona_fit +0.8, practical_usability +0.5. No dimension showed any regression. Chapter-level analysis confirms consistent improvements across all four modified chapters, with Chapter 09 (Tags, Conditions, Clocks) showing the strongest gains including a significant +1.01 improvement in persona_fit. The quick-reference tables, worked examples, and comparison boxes added during this iteration successfully addressed the original review issues.",
