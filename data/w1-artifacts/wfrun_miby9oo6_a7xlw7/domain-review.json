  "summary": "The four chapters demonstrate excellent internal consistency. All mechanical systems are correctly implemented: DC ladder values (12/14/16/18/20/22) are used consistently; outcome tier thresholds (Critical +5, Full 0+, Partial -1/-2, Failure -3 to -6, Critical Failure -7 or all 1s) are applied correctly in all examples; Edge/Burden mechanics follow the defined rules including the ±2 cap and cancellation rules; Clock sizes (4/6/8 segments) and advancement rates (1-2 for Full Success, 2-3 for Critical) are consistent between Chapter 09 definitions and Chapter 10 combat examples; Attribute arrays in example characters all follow the 2/1/1/0 spread. The worked combat examples in Chapter 10 accurately demonstrate the resolution system with correct margin calculations and appropriate Clock ticks. Cross-chapter references are appropriate, with Chapter 09 building on Chapter 08's Check system and Chapter 10 integrating Tags, Conditions, and Clocks as defined in Chapter 09. The three minor issues identified do not affect mechanical accuracy or playability. Approved for the next phase."
