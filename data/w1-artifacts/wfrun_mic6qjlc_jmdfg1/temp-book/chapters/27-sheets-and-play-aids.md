## 27. Sheets and Play Aids

Sheets and play aids translate the structure of this rulebook into tools you can put on the table. They help players track characters, GMs plan sessions and campaigns, and the whole group keep important references close at hand. You can print them, copy them into a digital notebook, or adapt them to your preferred tools.

### Player-Facing Sheets

Player-facing sheets focus on characters and their immediate perspective. At minimum, most campaigns benefit from three, which are provided as templates in `source/codex/sheets/`:

- **Core Character Sheet** (`core_rulebook_character_sheet.md`): Tracks identity, Attributes (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN), Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, personal Clocks, gear, and key relationships. It leaves space for narrative details (goals, secrets, threads) alongside mechanics.
- **Advancement & Threads Tracker** (`core_rulebook_advancement_tracker.md`): A place to note personal goals, unresolved hooks, Downtime projects, and advancement choices from Chapter 19.
- **Session Log** (`core_rulebook_session_log.md`): A one-page log to track current objectives, important clues, memorable moments, and changing Tags, Conditions, and Clocks.

When you build or adapt a character sheet, favor clarity over density. Group related information together: core stats near Skills, Proficiencies near background and role, current Conditions near Tags and Clocks. Consider a dedicated area for "fiction first" notes—things your character believes, fears, or wants.

### GM-Facing Sheets

GM sheets support prep and improvisation. They help you track fronts, factions, NPCs, and open questions without rewriting the entire rulebook each time. Common GM-facing sheets in `source/codex/sheets/` include:

- **GM Session Prep Worksheet** (`core_rulebook_gm_session_prep.md`): A page for today's session: key questions, opening situation, important NPCs, Clocks you expect to see, and Tags that define major locations or scenes.
- **Campaign & Fronts Sheet** (`core_rulebook_campaign_fronts_sheet.md`): Tracks long-term threats, factions, fronts, and the Clocks that represent their plans. It pairs naturally with Tags such as *Under Pressure*, *In Decline*, or *On the Rise*.
- **NPC and VPC Profiles** (`core_rulebook_npc_vpc_profile.md`): Short templates for recurring characters, including their role, core motivation, Tags (for example, *Charming*, *Overworked*, *Ruthless*), and any Conditions or Clocks tied to them.
- **Mystery or Scenario Frameworks:** Grids or mind-maps for investigations, intrigue, or multi-step scenarios showing connections between locations, clues, and factions.

Use GM sheets as living documents. Cross out, annotate, and redraw as the campaign changes. If a front or faction no longer matters, retire its sheet and create a new one for the pressures that now define your world.

### Mechanical Reference Sheets

Mechanical reference sheets condense rules you use frequently into quick-look tables. They should never replace the chapter text, but they can reduce page-flipping during intense scenes. Useful references in `source/codex/sheets/` include:

- **DC Ladder & Outcome Tiers** (`core_rulebook_reference_dc_tiers.md`): A table showing DC 12–22 with examples, plus the margin bands for Critical, Full, Partial, Failure, and Critical Failure.
- **Tags & Conditions Quick Lookup** (`core_rulebook_reference_tags_conditions.md`): A subset of the most common entries from Chapter 18 for fast use.
- **Clock Templates** (`core_rulebook_reference_clocks_templates.md`): Blank 4/6/8 segment Clocks you can photocopy or redraw as needed.

Many groups like to keep these references at the center of the table or on a shared digital board so that everyone can see how consequences and odds are being judged.

### Using and Adapting Existing Sheets

If you are working from earlier editions or companion books, you may already have a library of sheets: character templates, GM prep forms, encounter planners, and more. Most of them can be adapted to this Core Rulebook with minimal changes:

- Replace older stat or dice assumptions with the 4d6 system, DC ladder, and outcome tiers described in Part I.
- Update any references to superseded mechanics (for example, outdated stress or tier systems) to use Tags, Conditions, and Clocks instead.
- Align Skill and Proficiency fields with the open lists and examples in Chapters 14–17.

When in doubt, treat existing sheets as prototypes. Copy the layout you like, then relabel sections so that they match the language and structure of this book.

### Building Your Own Sheets

The best sheets are the ones you actually use. As your campaign develops, you may discover that you need a new kind of tracker—a heist staging sheet, a travel log, a faction treaty tracker. When you design a new sheet:

- Start from the questions you need to answer at the table ("Who is angry with us?", "What do we owe?").
- Give each sheet a clear purpose and a small number of sections.
- Include space for Tags, Conditions, and Clocks where they naturally apply.
- Label any connections to chapters (for example, "See Chapter 9 for Tag guidance").

You do not need to formalize every idea into a sheet. A simple half-page sketch can carry an arc of play. When a sheet keeps getting reused or recopied, consider turning it into a clean template for your group.

> **Example – Campaign Dashboard**
> One group creates a "campaign dashboard" sheet with three columns: Fronts (and their Clocks), Factions (and their current Tags), and Characters (with one or two key Conditions or edges each). At the start of every session, they update this sheet together. It becomes a shared map of pressures and opportunities that keeps everyone oriented without needing to reread every note.

### Printable Sheet Layouts

The following layouts mirror the sheet templates in `source/codex/sheets/` so you can print them directly from this rulebook. You can also treat them as visual references when building digital versions.
