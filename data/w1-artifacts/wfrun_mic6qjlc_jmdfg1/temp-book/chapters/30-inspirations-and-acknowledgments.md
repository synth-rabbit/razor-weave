# Chapter 30: Inspirations and Acknowledgments

## Inspirations

Razorweave draws inspiration from the broader tradition of tabletop roleplaying games while implementing its own unique systems and setting. The following games and design movements influenced our thinking during development:

### Modern RPG Design Philosophy

**Fiction-First Design**
The principle that narrative positioning and fictional context should drive mechanical resolution was shaped by observing many modern indie RPGs. We appreciate how games like *Apocalypse World*, *Blades in the Dark*, and *Fate* prioritize the story over pure mechanics.

**Streamlined Core Mechanics**
The trend toward elegant, unified resolution systems (rather than separate subsystems for every action) influenced our 4d6+modifier approach. Games that demonstrated you don't need dozens of different mechanics to create depth showed us a better path.

**Shared Narrative Authority**
The idea that players and GMs collaborate to build the story together—rather than the GM being the sole arbiter—can be seen across many successful modern games. We wanted Razorweave to embrace this collaborative spirit.

### Specific Mechanical Influences

**Graduated Success**
The concept of "success with cost" (our Partial Success) appears in many games dating back to early indie RPGs. Rather than binary pass/fail, graduated outcomes create richer stories. We implemented this through our margin-based system with five distinct outcome tiers.

**Progress Tracking**
The idea of segmented trackers to represent ongoing threats, projects, or conflicts has become common across many indie games. Our Clock system uses this proven concept while implementing it in our own way (4/6/8 segments, specific advancement rules).

**Edgeous Circumstances**
Many games represent favorable or unfavorable situations through dice modification. We liked this concept and created our own implementation using Edge (+1/+2) and Burden (-1/-2) to modify the number of dice kept from a 4d6 roll.

**Tags and Conditions**
The practice of using short descriptors to track environment and character state appears across numerous modern games. We built on this common design pattern to create our own Tag and Condition systems.

## Design Principles We Embraced

Rather than copying specific mechanics, we internalized these broader principles:

1. **Mechanics should serve the fiction** - Rules exist to support the story, not the other way around.
2. **Keep the math simple** - Players should spend time roleplaying, not calculating.
3. **Make consequences interesting** - Failure should complicate the story, not stop it.
4. **Trust the players** - Give them meaningful choices and respect their creativity.
5. **Fiction-first, always** - When rules and fiction conflict, fiction wins.

## What Makes Razorweave Unique

While inspired by the broader tradition of indie RPGs, Razorweave has its own identity:

- **4d6 margin-based resolution** - Our core mechanic is our own design, not borrowed from another game
- **Edge/Burden system** - Our implementation of advantageous circumstances uses unique terminology and dice mechanics
- **Four Attributes** - Might, Agility, Presence, and Reason are our own attribute framework
- **Skills that flex** - The same skill can pair with different attributes based on approach
- **Setting-agnostic with strong flavor** - While examples use telegraph/relay technology, the rules work for any genre
- **Original progression system** - Character advancement through milestone-based growth
- **Risk and Impact** - Our framework for assessing danger and effect in situations

### The RPG Community

We're grateful to the broader tabletop RPG community—designers, players, streamers, and critics—who have fostered a culture of experimentation, sharing, and innovation. Without this community's willingness to explore new ideas and share knowledge freely, Razorweave wouldn't exist.

### Playtesters & Early Readers

Thank you to everyone who provided feedback, caught errors, and helped refine these rules through actual play. Your contributions made this a better game.

## On Originality and Copyright

**This rulebook is original work.** While we've been influenced by the broader RPG design community (as acknowledged above), all text, examples, tables, and specific rule implementations are our own creation.

Game mechanics themselves cannot be copyrighted—only the specific expression of those mechanics. We've been careful to:
- Use our own terminology throughout
- Write all explanations in our own words
- Create original examples and flavor text
- Design our own progression systems and tables

If you notice any unintentional similarity to published material, please contact us so we can address it.

## Version History

Maintaining a clear version history demonstrates independent development:
- Git repository tracks all changes from initial concept through publication
- Commit history shows iterative design and refinement
- All development is documented and traceable

This transparency proves Razorweave was independently created, not derived from proprietary sources.

**Thank you for playing Razorweave.**

We hope these rules bring excitement, drama, and memorable stories to your table.
