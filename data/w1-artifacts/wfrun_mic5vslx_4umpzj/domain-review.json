    "status": "pass",
    "analysis": "The core 4d6 system with Edge/Burden provides approximately +2.5 average per level of Edge and -2.5 per level of Burden, creating meaningful but not overwhelming modifiers. DC ladder spacing of 2 points per tier aligns well with these modifiers. Clock sizes and advancement rates create appropriate pacing: a 4-segment mook can be defeated in 2-3 successful Strikes, a 6-segment standard threat in 3-5 actions, and an 8-segment boss requires sustained pressure or tactical preparation. The Partial Success tier (-1 to -2 margin) occupies roughly 15-20% of the probability space, ensuring meaningful 'succeed at cost' outcomes.",

    "status": "strong",
    "evidence": [
      "Character creation begins with concept before any mechanical choices",
      "Checks require uncertainty, consequence, and agency (not just difficulty)",
      "Tags as 'shared vocabulary' rather than rigid mechanical categories",
      "Resolve Clocks represent narrative pressure rather than abstract HP",
      "Combat stakes set before fighting to determine what 'taken out' means",
      "Worked examples consistently show fiction driving mechanical choices"
    ]
  },
  "summary": "All four chapters demonstrate excellent game design quality and mechanical consistency. The core resolution system (4d6 + Attribute vs DC, with Edge/Burden modifiers) is mathematically sound and narratively flexible. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks work together cohesively to make fictional positioning mechanically meaningful. Combat uses the same resolution framework as other scenes, maintaining system coherence while adding appropriate structure for tactical moments. The fiction-first philosophy is consistently maintained throughout, with worked examples demonstrating how narrative considerations drive mechanical choices. Minor suggestions offered are quality-of-life improvements rather than corrections. These chapters are ready for publication.",
  "recommendation": "APPROVE - All chapters pass domain review with high marks for mechanical accuracy, design coherence, and playability."
