## 6. Character Creation

Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule before you start. This chapter guides you step by step and tells you when to reference later chapters for details.

> **Quick-Start: 10-Minute Character**

> Need a character fast? Use this streamlined path for one-shots or time-pressed sessions:
>
> 1. **Concept in one sentence:** "A [role/background] who [defining trait or goal]."
> 2. **Attributes:** Use the standard array: 2 in your primary, 1 in two others, 0 in one.
> 3. **Skills:** Pick 3 from the Suggested Skills list below.
> 4. **Proficiencies:** Pick 2 from the Suggested Proficiencies list below.
> 5. **Gear:** Choose clothing, a backpack, and 2-3 items that fit your concept.
>
> You now have a playable character. Fill in name, background, and goals as you play. Return to the full chapter later to add depth.

### Learning by Example

Some players prefer to see a full character before reading detailed steps. If you want to follow a character build from start to finish, you can skip ahead to the Example Characters section later in this chapter and return to each step as needed.

### The Creation Flow

Character Creation follows a clear sequence. You begin with story driven questions, then add mechanical structure, then return to fiction to finalize your concept. Each step builds on the previous one.

1. Step One: Choose a Concept
1. Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements
1. Step Three: Assign Attributes
1. Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies
1. Step Four: Choose Skills
1. Step Five: Choose Proficiencies
1. Step Six: Determine Starting Gear
1. Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships
1. Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads
1. Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit

### Step One: Choose a Concept

Every character begins with a concept. A concept is the short answer to the question, who is this person. It is the foundation for every choice you make later in the process. The concept does not depend on mechanics. It does not require a long backstory. It is a clean expression of identity, role, and theme.

Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for discovery. A concept like retired scout with a guilty conscience offers a clearer direction than simply fighter. The first concept suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world. The second is mostly a job title.

> **Example**
> A player chooses the concept former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns. This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours, delicate tools, and unanswered questions.

Your concept should tell you what kind of scenes you want to be in, what skills you might have learned, and what challenges might matter to you. If you feel stuck, talk with the GM and the other players. The group can help you find a concept that fits the tone of the campaign.

### Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements

Identity elements are the personal details that give your character depth. They are the details that help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at once. The goal is to add enough information that the character feels real.

Useful identity elements include:

- Name and pronouns
- Origin or home environment
- Everyday role or profession before the story begins
- Notable habits and mannerisms
- First impressions and social style
- One or two key experiences that shaped them

These details are most helpful when they connect to your concept. If your concept involves quiet work and technical skill, identity elements that reflect that focus will make the character feel grounded.

> **Example**
> The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.

You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character. For now, capture the parts that feel most important.

### Step Three: Assign Attributes

Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character tends to approach challenges when there is no time to prepare a careful strategy. Attributes are not personality traits. They are expressions of how your character acts when the moment demands action.

The system uses four Attributes:

- **Might (MIG)**: Physical strength, force, and raw endurance.
- **Agility (AGI)**: Balance, coordination, stealth, and quick reaction.
- **Presence (PRE)**: Social force, confidence, emotional expression, and leadership.
- **Reason (RSN)**: Logic, analysis, memory, and structured thinking.

New characters begin with the following Attribute spread.

- One Attribute at 2
- Two Attributes at 1
- One Attribute at 0

No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability. Characters begin competent but not exceptional in every area. As the campaign progresses, advancement rules will allow Attributes to grow.

Assign these values based on your concept and identity elements. Ask yourself which Attribute your character relies on most often, which areas they find challenging, and which weaknesses might create interesting story moments.

#### Archetype Attribute Priorities

The table below shows recommended Attribute spreads for common character archetypes. These are starting points, not requirements. Your concept may suggest a different arrangement.

| Archetype | Primary (2) | Secondary (1, 1) | Weakness (0) | Example Concepts |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Combatant** | MIG or AGI | The other physical + PRE or RSN | PRE or RSN | Mercenary, bodyguard, athlete, enforcer |
| **Face** | PRE | RSN + AGI or MIG | MIG or AGI | Diplomat, con artist, performer, negotiator |
| **Scholar** | RSN | PRE + AGI | MIG | Researcher, analyst, engineer, physician |
| **Generalist** | Any | Two complementary | Any | Scout, investigator, jack-of-all-trades |

> **What This Means in Play - Combatant**
> With MIG 2 or AGI 2, you excel when violence or physical challenges arise. You hit harder, move faster, or endure longer than others. Your weakness in PRE or RSN means social manipulation or complex analysis will be harder. You rely on teammates for those challenges, or you approach them through action rather than finesse.

> **What This Means in Play - Face**
> With PRE 2, you shine in conversations, negotiations, and moments of emotional tension. You read people well and project confidence. Your physical weakness means you avoid direct combat when possible and rely on others to handle threats you cannot talk your way around.

> **What This Means in Play - Scholar**
> With RSN 2, you excel at analysis, research, and technical problem-solving. You notice patterns others miss and solve puzzles efficiently. Your MIG 0 means physical confrontations are dangerous for you. You prepare, plan, and let others take point when strength matters.

> **What This Means in Play - Generalist**
> A balanced spread means you can contribute to many situations without dominating any. You adapt to what the scene requires. This flexibility comes at the cost of peak performance. You will rarely be the best at any single task, but you will rarely be useless either.

> **Example - Annotated Build: Rella (Scholar Archetype)**
>
> Rella is analytical and steady. Her player considers the Attribute options:
>
> **Decision: Primary Attribute**
> *Choice:* RSN 2
> *Why:* Rella's concept centers on pattern recognition, cipher analysis, and technical knowledge. RSN directly supports these activities. MIG or PRE would contradict her established identity as a quiet, cerebral character.
>
> **Decision: Secondary Attributes**
> *Choice:* AGI 1, PRE 1
> *Why:* AGI reflects her steady hands and careful movement through tight maintenance spaces. PRE 1 (not 0) acknowledges that while quiet, she can connect with others when needed. Both support her background without overshadowing her technical focus.
>
> **Decision: Weakness**
> *Choice:* MIG 0
> *Why:* Physical labor was never central to Rella's life. This weakness creates interesting tension: she cannot force her way through problems and must rely on cleverness or allies.
>
> **Playstyle This Enables:**
> Rella excels at RSN-based Checks: decoding messages, analyzing evidence, recalling technical details, spotting logical flaws. She contributes meaningfully to careful movement (AGI) and occasional social moments (PRE). Physical confrontations put her at risk, encouraging creative problem-solving rather than direct action.
>
> **Alternative Build Comparison:**
> If Rella's player wanted a more physically capable version, they might choose AGI 2, RSN 1, PRE 1, MIG 0. This "Technical Infiltrator" variant trades analytical depth for mobility and stealth, shifting Rella toward a character who sneaks past problems rather than solving them intellectually.

> **Example - Annotated Build: Varn (Face Archetype)**
>
> Varn is a charming ex-courier who trades in secrets. His player walks through the Attribute decisions:
>
> **Decision: Primary Attribute**
> *Choice:* PRE 2
> *Why:* Varn's concept is built around social manipulation, reading people, and projecting confidence. PRE is the obvious choice for someone whose survival depends on talking his way through dangerous situations.
>
> **Decision: Secondary Attributes**
> *Choice:* AGI 1, RSN 1
> *Why:* AGI supports quick reflexes from navigating crowded spaces and making fast escapes when charm fails. RSN reflects his sharp memory for names, faces, debts, and the web of connections he maintains.
>
> **Decision: Weakness**
> *Choice:* MIG 0
> *Why:* Varn avoids physical confrontation entirely. His weakness is deliberate: he has structured his life to never be in a position where strength matters. When violence threatens, he talks, runs, or hides.
>
> **Playstyle This Enables:**
> Varn dominates social encounters: persuasion, deception, intimidation through confidence, reading intentions. His AGI lets him escape trouble; his RSN lets him remember who owes what to whom. Physical combat is genuinely dangerous for him, creating tension when talking fails.
>
> **Alternative Build Comparison:**
> A "Streetwise Survivor" variant might choose AGI 2, PRE 1, RSN 1, MIG 0. This shifts Varn toward a character who relies more on physical evasion and less on pure charm, useful in campaigns with more action and less intrigue.

### Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies

This system does not rely on a fixed or exhaustive list of Skills or Proficiencies. The rulebook provides examples and frameworks, but players are encouraged to work with their GM to define custom entries that reflect their character's experiences, training, and background.

Skills and Proficiencies serve different purposes.

- **Skills** are action based competencies. They are used directly in Checks when your character attempts something under pressure or uncertainty.
- **Proficiencies** are narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines that your character understands well and that shape how the GM interprets the fiction.

Open lists and collaboration allow the system to support many different genres and character concepts without requiring constant balance adjustments. Because the resolution system and advantage rules keep extremes in check, creative choices stay within a stable range.

The GM has final approval over the scope of any custom Skill or Proficiency. A good entry is grounded in the setting, clear in purpose, and neither so broad that it covers everything nor so narrow that it rarely matters.

### Step Four: Choose Skills

Skills represent learned abilities and practiced competencies. They describe what your character has done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. Skills connect directly to action. When your character makes a Check, a Skill often shapes their approach.

Skills answer the question, what have you practiced enough to apply under stress. They cover actions such as moving quietly, reading a room, patching an injury, climbing, or analyzing a pattern. Skills are usually written as verbs or verb like phrases.

> **Suggested Skills**
>
> A Skill should be broad enough to apply in multiple situations but specific enough to feel distinct.
>
> **Too broad:** "Good at everything physical."
> **Too narrow:** "Tying sailor knots."
> **Just right:** "Athletics" or "Acrobatics."
>
> | Category | Example Skills |
> |----------|----------------|
> | **Physical** | Athletics, Acrobatics, Climbing, Swimming, Endurance, Brawling |
> | **Social** | Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Empathy, Negotiation |
> | **Mental** | Investigation, Observation, Analysis, Research, Memory, Deduction |
> | **Technical** | Technical Work, Crafting, Machinery, First Aid, Lockpicking, Piloting |
> | **Stealth/Survival** | Stealth, Survival, Tracking, Navigation, Foraging |
>
> Choose 3-4 Skills that fit your concept. You may also create custom Skills with GM approval.

> **Starter Skill Packages**
>
> If you want a fast, balanced starting point, consider these pre-built Skill combinations. Each package supports a common archetype while leaving room for customization.
>
> | Package | Skills | Best For |
> |---------|--------|----------|
> | **Combat Ready** | Athletics, Brawling, Intimidation, Endurance | Characters who expect violence and physical challenges |
> | **Social Operator** | Persuasion, Empathy, Deception, Observation | Characters who navigate through conversation and reading people |
> | **Technical Expert** | Technical Work, Investigation, Observation, Analysis | Characters who solve problems through knowledge and careful study |
> | **Field Agent** | Stealth, Athletics, Observation, Navigation | Characters who move through dangerous environments and gather information |
>
> **When to Use Pre-Built Packages:**
> - You are new to the system and want a reliable starting point
> - You are creating a character quickly for a one-shot
> - You want a clear mechanical identity that matches your concept
>
> **When to Customize Instead:**
> - Your concept does not fit neatly into one archetype
> - You want to blend capabilities from multiple packages
> - You have specific narrative hooks that suggest unusual Skills
> - The campaign has unique demands that standard packages do not address
>
> You can always adjust Skills during early sessions if you find your initial choices do not match your playstyle.

During Character Creation, choose a small set of Skills that reflect your concept and background. These are the actions your character knows how to perform with some confidence. Later chapters describe Skills in more detail and provide example lists grouped by Attribute.

> **Example**
> Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels.

You do not need to optimize your Skills. The best choices are the ones that support the kinds of scenes you want to experience. If your group plans to focus on investigation, travel, or social tension, choose Skills that will shine in those situations.

### Step Five: Choose Proficiencies

Proficiencies represent narrower areas of expertise that influence how the GM interprets the fiction. They describe tools, technologies, environments, or disciplines that your character understands deeply. Proficiencies often do not require a roll at all. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is obvious, or how serious a risk feels.

Proficiencies answer the question, what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly. They often appear as nouns or domain labels, such as medical tools, survey equipment, or small boat navigation.

> **Suggested Proficiencies**
>
> Proficiencies represent specialized knowledge or tool familiarity. They often allow automatic success or avoid Checks entirely for routine applications.
>
> | Category | Example Proficiencies |
> |----------|----------------------|
> | **Tools** | Precision Tools, Medical Instruments, Lockpicks, Climbing Gear, Navigation Equipment |
> | **Knowledge** | Local History, Legal Procedures, Arcane Lore, Engineering Principles, Natural Sciences |
> | **Social Contexts** | Court Etiquette, Criminal Underworld, Academic Circles, Military Protocol |
> | **Environments** | Urban Navigation, Wilderness Survival, Underground Exploration, Maritime Operations |
> | **Vehicles/Craft** | Small Watercraft, Ground Vehicles, Aircraft, Mounted Animals |
>
> Choose 2-3 Proficiencies that reflect your background. Work with your GM to define scope.

During Character Creation, choose a small number of Proficiencies that grow naturally out of your concept and background. Work with the GM to make sure each Proficiency has a clear scope and fits the setting.

> **Example**
> Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.

Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they influence difficulty, consequences, and access to information. A character with the correct Proficiency may identify a hazard more quickly, avoid an unnecessary roll, or reduce the severity of a complication.

### Step Six: Determine Starting Gear

Your character begins play with a small set of equipment that fits their background, reflects their concept, and supports the type of stories they are about to enter. Gear does not provide numerical bonuses. It provides narrative capability, fictional positioning, and a sense of grounded reality.

Starting gear should feel personal and practical. It represents what your character already knows how to use. It also helps the GM understand what kind of situations your character is prepared for.

#### Basic Gear Package

New characters begin with the following items:

- Clothing suited to their environment
- A backpack or satchel
- Basic travel supplies
- A personal item that holds meaning

These are the essentials that allow any character to operate in the world.

#### Concept Driven Gear

In addition to the basic gear, each character chooses up to three items that reflect their background or profession. These items help define who they were before the story begins. They also give the GM material to work with when shaping scenes.

Examples include:

- A well used toolkit
- A compact field journal
- A collection of reference notes
- A handmade navigation compass
- A signal mirror
- A small medical pouch
- A set of precision tools
- A reliable lantern
- A simple musical instrument
- A deck of analysis cards
- A set of rope and climbing spikes

These items should feel directly connected to your concept and identity.

> **Example**
> Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work.

#### Tools and Equipment as Fictional Authority

Gear provides fictional authority. If your character carries the right tools for a task, the GM may:

- Lower difficulty
- Remove uncertainty
- Change the stakes
- Provide clearer approaches

Gear does not guarantee success. It enables meaningful choices and supports your character's expertise.

If the character does not have suitable gear, the GM might increase difficulty or introduce complications. Gear matters most when the environment or situation is demanding.

#### Weapons and Dangerous Tools

If the campaign tone allows for weapons or hazardous tools, characters may begin with one simple item that fits their concept. This might be:

- A pocket knife
- A small baton
- A bow with a few arrows
- A sturdy multi tool
- A simple sidearm, if the genre supports it

Weapons should be grounded in the fiction of your setting. They are not meant to be superior mechanical objects. They are narrative tools that help shape how your character approaches risk.

If your world does not include weapons or includes them only sparingly, this section may be reduced or removed based on GM preference.

#### Custom Gear

The player and GM may collaborate to create custom gear that supports the concept. The item should be:

- Clear in purpose
- Grounded in the setting
- Useful in scenes
- Not mechanically overwhelming

Good custom gear is memorable and unique without dominating the story.

### Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships

Every character comes from somewhere. They have lived a life before the story begins. They have connections, memories, challenges, and unfinished business. Establishing background and relationships gives the character emotional depth and provides the GM with narrative tools that will enrich scenes, challenges, and future arcs.

Background should answer simple questions about where you grew up, what kind of work you used to do, which pressures shaped you, and who influenced your habits. You do not need a long timeline. Focus on the few details that explain your current self.

> **Example**
> Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. The steady routine and quiet tension of relay work shaped her temperament and made her comfortable with long stretches of focused attention.

In addition to background, define one or two meaningful relationships. These might be mentors, rivals, family members, coworkers, or friends. The relationship does not need to be fully detailed. It only needs to be important enough that it might matter later.

> **Example**
> Rella names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing. Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods. The disagreement left tension that has never been resolved.

You do not need to define every relationship up front. Leave space for new connections to emerge in play. When a new NPC feels important, you can add them to your relationship list.

### Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads

Goals and drives explain why your character keeps moving. They are the internal pressures that shape choices and responses. A goal is something concrete your character wants to achieve. A drive is a deeper motivation or fear that pushes them.

Personal threads are unresolved elements in your character's life. They might be unanswered questions, unfulfilled promises, or lingering tensions. These threads give the GM material to weave into future scenes.

> **Example**
> Rella has a goal to decode an anomalous pattern she once intercepted and a drive to avoid causing harm through her work. A personal thread involves the mysterious origin of the pattern and who might have sent it.

Try to define at least one short-term goal, one long-term goal, and one or two personal threads. You can always revise these as the story unfolds.

### Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit

Once you have completed the previous steps, review your character as a whole. Ask whether the concept, identity elements, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, goals, and threads feel like parts of the same person.

Talk with the GM and other players about how your character fits into the campaign. Look for natural connections, shared history, or complementary goals. Adjust details where needed so that the group feels like a cohesive cast.

### Chapter Summary

Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the campaign. By moving from concept to identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, and goals, you build a character who feels grounded and ready for play. Later chapters explain how these elements interact with the core mechanics during sessions.
