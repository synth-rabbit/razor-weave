## 10. Combat Basics

Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core combat actions to shape the fiction.

### Combat as a Scene

Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does not call for "initiative" the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know who acts in what order and how threats respond.

The table can always ask, "Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?" Use structured turns when:

- Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.
- Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.
- Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.

Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration. Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate "combat mode."

### Resolve Instead of Hit Points

The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close someone is to being taken out of a fight.

- **Resolve Clocks** track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC (Vital Player Character—a significant NPC), or enemy can absorb before they are out of the scene.
- **Conditions** such as *Bleeding*, *Exhausted*, or *Stunned* mark lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.

When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your opponent's Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse, depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.

> **Why Resolve Clocks?**
>
> If you are coming from games with hit points, Resolve Clocks may feel unfamiliar. Here is why this system uses them:
>
> **Traditional HP:** A number that decreases. You ask "how many hit points left?" Combat becomes arithmetic—subtract damage, track totals, compare numbers.
>
> **Resolve Clocks:** Fictional pressure that increases. You ask "how close is this character to being taken out?" Combat becomes story—when do they falter, become desperate, finally break?
>
> | HP System | Resolve Clock System |
> |-----------|---------------------|
> | "The orc has 15 HP left" | "The orc's Clock is half full—he's getting desperate" |
> | "I deal 8 damage" | "Full Success on Strike—tick 2 segments" |
> | "He's at 0 HP, he dies" | "Clock fills—he flees, surrenders, or falls" |
> | Outcome is always depletion to zero | Outcome fits the stakes: defeat, capture, retreat |
> | Progress is hidden in numbers | Progress is visible: everyone sees the Clock filling |
>
> This keeps attention on narrative stakes rather than arithmetic, and lets different fights end in different ways.

#### Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?

Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:

- **Fiction first** – A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at "0 HP."
- **Visible progress** – A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.
- **Flexible stakes** – Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.
- **Pacing control** – The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick, cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.

Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and story rather than pure attrition.

#### Clock Sizing Guidelines

The size of a Resolve Clock determines how much punishment a combatant can absorb before being taken out. Use these guidelines to set appropriate Clock sizes:

| Clock Size | Threat Level | Example Combatants |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 4-segment | Mooks, minor threats | Street thugs, guard dogs, panicked civilians, standard henchmen |
| 6-segment | Standard threats | Trained soldiers, dangerous beasts, rival adventurers, skilled enforcers |
| 8-segment | Bosses, major threats | VPCs, elite warriors, supernatural entities, climactic antagonists |

> **GM Guidance - Sizing Clocks to Stakes**
> Match Clock size to narrative importance, not just physical toughness:
> - A scrappy kid protecting their family might have a 6-segment Clock because their determination matters to the story.
> - A hulking bodyguard who exists only as an obstacle might have a 4-segment Clock because the fight is not about them.
> - Consider splitting large threats: instead of one 8-segment Clock, two 4-segment Clocks create more tactical options and dramatic moments.

#### Clock Advancement Rates

When you land a successful Strike or effective combat action, the GM advances the target's Resolve Clock according to the outcome tier:

| Outcome | Standard Strike | Effective Maneuver | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments | Tick 1-2 segments + strong Tag/Condition | Devastating blow; GM chooses higher end for dramatic moments |
| **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments | Tick 1 segment + Tag/Condition | Solid hit; tick 2 for well-positioned attacks or vulnerable targets |
| **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment | Apply Tag/Condition only | Progress at a cost; expect a counter or complication |
| **Failure** | No progress | No progress | Miss or glancing blow; opponent may gain advantage |

> **Example - Clock Advancement in Practice**
> Kira faces a 6-segment enforcer. Her first Strike is a **Full Success** against an unaware target—the GM ticks 2 segments. Her second Strike is another **Full Success**, but now the enforcer is ready—the GM ticks 1 segment. On round three, Kira scores a **Critical Success** while the enforcer is *Exposed*—the GM ticks 3 segments, filling the Clock.

The GM has discretion within these ranges. Factors that push toward the higher end of the range include:
- Target is already suffering Conditions
- Attacker exploits a Tag (such as *Exposed* or *Flanked*)
- Fictional positioning strongly favors the attack
- Weapon or ability is particularly effective against this target

Factors that push toward the lower end include:
- Target has protective Tags (such as *Solid Cover* or *Armored*)
- Attack is opportunistic rather than well-planned
- Target's Conditions suggest they are fighting defensively

> **Example – Enemy Resolve**
> A dangerous VPC has a 6-segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of the fight in a way that fits the story.

Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.

Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what "taken out" means in this scene. Are you trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises about consequences.

### Turns and Order

Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach that fits the scene.

#### Turn Order Options

| Mode | How It Works | Best For | Example Situation |
|------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Conversational** | GM asks "Who acts next?" and rotates spotlight naturally | Small skirmishes, narrative focus, simple fights | A barroom brawl where dramatic timing matters more than tactical precision |
| **Popcorn** | After resolving your turn, you choose who goes next (ally or enemy) | Dynamic fights, unpredictable flow, keeping everyone engaged | A chaotic street fight where initiative shifts based on who seizes opportunities |
| **Rolled** | Each participant rolls AGI or relevant Check; act in order from highest to lowest | Tactical set-pieces, when precise timing matters, competitive scenarios | An ambush where preparation and reflexes determine who strikes first |

> **GM Tip: Match Initiative to Scene Tone**
> - *Tense standoffs* - Use Conversational to build suspense and allow negotiation
> - *Chaotic melees* - Use Popcorn to capture confusion and surprise everyone
> - *Tactical ambushes* - Use Rolled to reward preparation and establish clear sequence
> - *Mixed encounters* - Start Conversational, shift to Rolled when violence erupts

Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands who is up next.

> **Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order**
> A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, "We're in structured turns now," and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.

### Your Turn: Structure and Options

On your turn, you usually:

- Describe what you do in the fiction.
- Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).
- Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.

If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters, it often fits into the same turn.

Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.

### Core Combat Actions

Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:

- **Strike** – Directly attack a target.
- **Maneuver** – Change position, create openings, or control space.
- **Set Up** – Create Edge or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.
- **Defend / Withdraw** – Protect yourself or break contact to recover.

#### Turn Structure Summary

This table summarizes what each combat action accomplishes:

| Action | What It Accomplishes | Typical Attributes | Clock Effects |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Strike** | Deal direct harm or pressure to a target | MIG (melee power), AGI (precision/speed), RSN (aimed shots, exploiting weakness) | **Full Success:** Tick 1-2 segments. **Partial:** Tick 1 segment at a cost. **Critical:** Tick 2-3 segments. |
| **Maneuver** | Change position, apply Tags, create openings, control space | AGI (acrobatics, dodging), MIG (shoving, grappling), RSN (tactical repositioning) | **Full Success:** Tick 0-1 segments + apply Tag. **Partial:** Apply Tag at a cost, no Clock progress. |
| **Set Up** | Grant Edge or helpful Tags to yourself or allies | PRE (calling targets, coordinating), AGI (flanking, feinting), RSN (identifying weaknesses) | No direct Clock progress. Creates advantage for future Strikes. |
| **Defend/Withdraw** | Protect yourself, avoid harm, break contact | AGI (dodging, diving for cover), MIG (blocking, bracing), PRE (intimidating pursuit) | No Clock progress. May clear Conditions or remove attacker Edge. |

> **Note - Choosing Your Action**
> When uncertain which action to use, ask yourself:
> - "Am I trying to hurt them directly?" - **Strike**
> - "Am I trying to change the situation?" - **Maneuver**
> - "Am I trying to help someone else succeed?" - **Set Up**
> - "Am I trying to survive or escape?" - **Defend/Withdraw**

#### Strike

Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot, hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on your opponent's awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.

On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become *Exposed*, suffer a counterblow, or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your opponent a positional or narrative advantage.

Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you commit to repeated Strikes.

#### Maneuver

Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside a weapon.

Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can create *Prone*, strip *Solid Cover*, or apply a useful Tag such as *Exposed* that allies can exploit on later turns.

Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a rope bridge. In sci-fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single Strike.

#### Set Up

Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you grant Edge or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the opening but at some cost.

Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Edge you create.

As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher-tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better positions, cover, and Edge, Strikes become dramatically more effective.

#### Defend / Withdraw

Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover, blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition or yielding ground.

This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or surviving to fight another day.

Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it, the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from "win here" to "escape, regroup, or change the stakes." Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.

### Positioning and Environment

Tags play a major role in combat. *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*, *Fragile Cover*, *Slick*, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or change what is possible at all. Manage position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.

> **Example – Using the Battlefield**
> In a rooftop fight marked as *Elevated* with scattered *Fragile Cover*, one character uses Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting Edge on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats *Elevated* as granting Edge on ranged attacks from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.

### Conditions in Combat

Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being *Stunned* by a concussive blast, *Bleeding* after a severe hit, or *Suppressed* by incoming fire. These Conditions modify subsequent Checks and shape choices.

Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be cleared. For example, *Stunned* might end after you lose your next action, while *Exhausted* may persist until you rest between scenes.

Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both *Bleeding* and *Exhausted* is under pressure each round and rolling with Burden on many actions. Scenes like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.

### Worked Combat Examples

These examples show complete combat sequences with Resolve Clock progression, demonstrating how the system flows in practice. Each example includes tactical annotations explaining key decisions.

---

#### Example 1: The Tense Duel (Rolled Initiative)

**Setup:** Kira, a skilled duelist (AGI 2, Brawling Skill), faces Varro, a rival enforcer. Both have 4-segment Resolve Clocks. The scene is a rain-slicked courtyard (*Slick* Tag). Stakes: first to be taken out loses the dispute and must leave the city.

**Initiative:** Both roll AGI-based Checks. Kira rolls 15, Varro rolls 17. Varro acts first.

> *Tactical Note: Rolled initiative rewards Varro's preparation—he chose the time and place for this confrontation. Kira must now respond from a disadvantage.*

**Round 1 – Varro Strikes First**
- Varro lunges with his blade. AGI Check vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 4d6 (3, 4, 5, 5) = 17. Margin +3.
- *Result:* **Full Success**.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 2 segments (now 2/4). She staggers back.
- *Fiction:* The blade catches her arm—a shallow cut but a solid hit. Rain mixes with blood.

> *Tactical Note: Varro's aggressive opening puts immediate pressure on Kira. With half her Clock already filled, she cannot afford to trade blow for blow.*

**Round 2 – Kira Sets Up**
- Rather than strike back at a disadvantage, Kira circles, watching his footwork, looking for a pattern. **Set Up** action.
- *Roll:* AGI Check vs. DC 14. 4d6 (2, 4, 6, 6) = 18. Margin +4.
- *Result:* **Full Success**.
- *Effect:* Kira gains Edge on her next Strike. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* She notices he overextends on his lunges—his rear foot slides on the *Slick* stones. She can exploit that.

> *Tactical Note: This is the correct play. Down 2 segments with no advantage, Kira uses Set Up to create Edge rather than gambling on a straight Strike. Patience now means devastation later.*

**Round 3 – Varro Strikes Again**
- Varro presses his advantage, not realizing she is baiting him. AGI Check vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 4d6 (1, 3, 4, 5) = 13. Margin -1.
- *Result:* **Partial Success**.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 1 segment (now 3/4), but Varro is now off-balance (*Exposed* Tag).
- *Fiction:* His blade grazes her side, but his foot slips on the wet stone. He stumbles.

> *Tactical Note: The Partial Success still advances Kira's Clock, but the cost to Varro (becoming Exposed) is severe. The momentum is shifting.*

**Round 4 – Kira Strikes**
- Using her Edge from Round 2 and his *Exposed* Tag (another Edge), Kira feints low and strikes high. AGI Check with +2 Edge vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 6d6 keep best 4 (2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6) = 22. Margin +8.
- *Result:* **Critical Success**.
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/4). He reels.
- *Fiction:* Her blade opens a gash on his shoulder. Blood sprays across the wet flagstones. He cries out.

> *Tactical Note: Stacking Edge from Set Up with the situational Edge from Exposed creates devastating results. This is why Set Up matters—Kira's patience converted a losing position into a decisive strike.*

**Round 5 – Varro Attempts to Withdraw**
- Desperate and bleeding, Varro tries to disengage and flee. **Defend/Withdraw** action vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* AGI Check. 4d6 (2, 2, 3, 4) = 11. Margin -3.
- *Result:* **Failure**.
- *Effect:* Varro cannot escape. Kira gets a free response.
- *Fiction:* He turns to run, but his foot slides again on the *Slick* courtyard. He goes to one knee.

**Round 6 – Kira Finishes It**
- With Varro on his knees and unable to defend, Kira presses. The GM rules this is DC 12 (Easy—he is helpless).
- *Roll:* 4d6 (3, 4, 4, 5) = 16. Margin +4.
- *Result:* **Full Success**.
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock fills (4/4). He is taken out.
- *Fiction:* She kicks his blade away and puts her point to his throat. "Yield." He does.

**Outcome:** Kira wins with 3/4 on her Clock—she was close to defeat herself. Varro is alive but humiliated. Per the stakes, he must leave the city. The *Slick* Tag shaped the entire fight, creating the opening Kira needed.

> *Post-Combat Analysis: This duel demonstrates the importance of Set Up actions when behind. Kira's Round 2 Set Up created the Edge that, combined with Varro's Exposed condition, produced the Critical Success that turned the fight. Without that preparation, she would likely have lost a straight exchange.*

---

#### Example 2: The Group Ambush (Popcorn Initiative)

**Setup:** Three PCs (Kira the duelist, Varn the veteran, Rella the scoundrel) ambush four smugglers in a warehouse. Tags: *Cramped* (aisles between crates), *Fragile Cover* (wooden boxes), *Dim Light*. The smugglers share a 6-segment group Resolve Clock (standard threats). Each PC has a 4-segment Clock. Stakes: capture the smugglers and recover stolen goods.

**Initiative:** The GM chooses Popcorn order since this is a chaotic ambush. The PCs struck first, so Kira opens.

> *Tactical Note: Popcorn initiative lets the ambushers capitalize on surprise—they can chain actions before enemies respond. But eventually they must pass to the smugglers, creating tension about when to do so.*

**Round 1 – Kira Strikes from Shadow**
- Kira drops from rafters onto the nearest smuggler. AGI Check vs. DC 12 (Easy—target unaware).
- *Roll:* 4d6 (4, 5, 5, 6) = 20. Margin +8.
- *Result:* **Critical Success**.
- *Effect:* Smuggler Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/6). One smuggler is down immediately.
- *Fiction:* She lands blade-first. The smuggler crumples without a sound. The others spin toward the noise.
- **Kira passes to Rella** (keeping momentum with allies).

> *Tactical Note: Kira exploits surprise for a devastating opening. In Popcorn, she wisely passes to another PC rather than giving enemies a chance to respond.*

**Round 2 – Rella Sets Up**
- Rella throws her lantern at the smugglers' feet, creating chaos. PRE-based **Set Up** vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 4d6 (3, 4, 5, 6) = 18. Margin +4.
- *Result:* **Full Success**.
- *Effect:* The area gains *Hazardous* (fire) and *Smoke* Tags. Varn gains Edge on his next action.
- *Fiction:* Oil splashes and ignites. Two smugglers scramble back, coughing. "There! In the smoke!"
- **Rella passes to Varn** (setting up his Strike).

> *Tactical Note: Excellent teamwork. Rella's Set Up creates battlefield control (Hazardous, Smoke) AND gives Varn Edge. The Tags also impose Burden on smuggler actions requiring clear sight.*

**Round 3 – Varn Strikes Through the Smoke**
- Varn charges through the smoke, using it as cover. MIG-based Strike with +1 Edge vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 5d6 keep 4 (2, 4, 5, 5, 6) = 20. Margin +6.
- *Result:* **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more).
- *Effect:* Smuggler Clock ticks 2 segments (now 5/6). Another smuggler falls.
- *Fiction:* Varn emerges from the flames like a specter, his blade already swinging. A second smuggler drops.
- **Varn passes to Smugglers** (three PCs have acted; fairness requires passing).

> *Tactical Note: The PCs chained three actions before passing, devastating the smugglers. But Popcorn's balance means they now face a response. Varn passes when the odds favor them.*

**Round 4 – Smugglers Fight Back**
- The two remaining smugglers are *Panicked*. One attacks Kira (nearest), one tries to flee.
- Attacking smuggler: AGI Check vs. DC 14, with Burden from *Smoke*.
- *Roll:* 5d6 keep worst 4 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) = 10. Margin -4.
- *Result:* **Failure**.
- *Effect:* No Clock advance on Kira. The attack goes wild.
- Fleeing smuggler: AGI Check vs. DC 16 (the fire blocks easy exits).
- *Roll:* 4d6 (2, 3, 3, 5) = 13. Margin -3.
- *Result:* **Failure**.
- *Effect:* He stumbles into crates, going *Prone*.
- **Smugglers pass to Rella** (trying to split PC actions).

> *Tactical Note: The Smoke Tag Rella created now pays dividends—Burden on smuggler actions. Both smuggler actions fail. Environmental control through Maneuver and Set Up can be more valuable than direct Strikes.*

**Round 5 – Rella Grapples the Runner**
- Rella tackles the *Prone* smuggler to pin him. AGI-based **Maneuver** vs. DC 12 (Easy—he is Prone).
- *Roll:* 4d6 (3, 4, 5, 5) = 17. Margin +5.
- *Result:* **Critical Success**.
- *Effect:* Smuggler is *Restrained*. Clock ticks 1 segment (6/6—filled!).
- *Fiction:* She lands on his back, wrenching his arm behind him. "Stay down!"
- **Combat ends** – Clock filled.

**Outcome:** All four smugglers neutralized in five rounds. Kira has 0/4 on her Clock (untouched). The fire needs handling, but the goods are recoverable. One smuggler can be questioned.

> *Post-Combat Analysis: This fight showcases Popcorn initiative's strength in ambush scenarios. The PCs chained three actions to neutralize half the enemies before passing. Rella's Set Up created multiple advantageous Tags that stacked Burden on enemies, making their response ineffective. Against a prepared enemy, this would have been harder.*

---

#### Example 3: The Desperate Defense (Conversational Initiative)

**Setup:** Kira and Varn must hold a narrow bridge while civilians evacuate behind them. They face the Ironmask, a VPC mercenary captain (8-segment Clock—boss-tier threat), and two of his soldiers (4-segment shared Clock). Tags: *Narrow* (bridge allows only two combatants side-by-side), *Elevated* (long drop below), *Rickety* (structure may fail). Stakes: hold for five rounds until evacuation completes. The GM tracks a 5-segment "Evacuation" Clock alongside the combat.

**Initiative:** Conversational, with the GM rotating spotlight to build tension. The Ironmask opens.

> *Tactical Note: Conversational initiative lets the GM pace the scene dramatically. Holding actions and positioning matter more than speed here.*

**Round 1 – Ironmask Assesses**
- Rather than charge, the Ironmask hangs back and directs his soldiers forward. **Set Up** action (PRE-based) vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 4d6 (4, 4, 5, 6) = 19. Margin +5.
- *Result:* **Critical Success**.
- *Effect:* Both soldiers gain Edge on their attacks. The Ironmask studies the PCs for weaknesses.
- *Fiction:* "The veteran favors his left side. The woman is faster—isolate her. Go."

> *Tactical Note: Smart enemy tactics. The VPC uses Set Up rather than engaging directly, making his soldiers more dangerous while staying safe. PCs should recognize this threat.*

**Round 1 continued – Soldiers Advance**
- Two soldiers advance onto the bridge and Strike at Varn. Group MIG Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 5d6 keep 4 (3, 4, 5, 5, 6) = 20. Margin +6.
- *Result:* **Critical Success**.
- *Effect:* Varn's Clock ticks 2 segments (now 2/4). He staggers under coordinated blows.
- *Fiction:* Their blades come in high and low simultaneously. Varn blocks one but takes the other across his ribs.
- GM ticks Evacuation Clock: 1/5.

> *Tactical Note: The Ironmask's Set Up paid off immediately—soldiers scored a Critical. Varn is in trouble early.*

**Round 2 – Varn Defends**
- Bloodied, Varn falls back into a defensive stance. **Defend/Withdraw** to hold the line rather than retreat. MIG Check vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 4d6 (3, 4, 5, 6) = 18. Margin +4.
- *Result:* **Full Success**.
- *Effect:* Varn removes the *Vulnerable* Tag the Ironmask identified. He creates *Braced* Tag for himself.
- *Fiction:* He sets his feet, raises his shield, and bellows "Come on then!" The soldiers hesitate.

> *Tactical Note: Defend/Withdraw is the right call here. Varn is hurt; continuing to Strike would be reckless. His Full Success removes the enemy's advantage and creates protection.*

**Round 2 continued – Kira Strikes the Soldiers**
- Kira exploits the soldiers' hesitation. AGI Strike vs. DC 14 (soldiers, not the boss).
- *Roll:* 4d6 (4, 5, 5, 6) = 20. Margin +6.
- *Result:* **Critical Success**.
- *Effect:* Soldier Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/4).
- *Fiction:* Her blade finds a gap in one soldier's guard. He goes down clutching his arm. The other backs up.
- GM ticks Evacuation Clock: 2/5.

> *Tactical Note: Kira correctly targets the soldiers rather than the Ironmask. Reducing the number of enemies is more important than slowly chipping at the boss.*

**Round 3 – Ironmask Enters the Fight**
- With one soldier down, the Ironmask steps onto the bridge himself. **Strike** vs. Kira (the faster threat). MIG Check vs. DC 16 (Kira is skilled).
- *Roll:* 4d6 (5, 5, 6, 6) = 22. Margin +6.
- *Result:* **Critical Success**.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/4). She is nearly taken out.
- *Fiction:* His blow sends her reeling. Only Varn's arm keeps her from going over the edge.
- *Fiction (Ironmask):* "You should have run with the sheep."

> *Tactical Note: Boss-tier enemies hit hard. Even with a good DC, the Ironmask's Critical nearly ends Kira. The PCs need to change tactics.*

**Round 3 continued – Remaining Soldier Strikes Varn**
- Emboldened, the remaining soldier attacks Varn. MIG Check vs. DC 14, but Varn is *Braced* (Burden).
- *Roll:* 5d6 keep worst 4 (2, 2, 3, 4, 6) = 11. Margin -3.
- *Result:* **Failure**.
- *Effect:* No Clock advance. The blow glances off Varn's shield.
- GM ticks Evacuation Clock: 3/5.

**Round 4 – Kira Maneuvers Desperately**
- Nearly out, Kira cannot trade Strikes with the Ironmask. She uses the *Rickety* Tag—stamping hard on a weak plank to unbalance him. **Maneuver** (AGI) vs. DC 16.
- *Roll:* 4d6 (4, 5, 5, 6) = 20. Margin +4.
- *Result:* **Full Success**.
- *Effect:* Ironmask gains *Off-Balance* Tag. The bridge gains *Damaged* Tag. Kira ticks 1 segment on his Clock (now 1/8).
- *Fiction:* The plank cracks. The Ironmask stumbles, grabbing a rope to steady himself. The whole bridge sways.

> *Tactical Note: Brilliant adaptation. Kira cannot out-fight the Ironmask, but she can use the environment. The Maneuver creates an opening AND advances his Clock.*

**Round 4 continued – Varn Finishes the Soldier**
- Varn presses the remaining soldier. MIG Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Roll:* 4d6 (3, 4, 5, 6) = 18. Margin +4.
- *Result:* **Full Success**.
- *Effect:* Soldier Clock fills (4/4). The last soldier is down.
- *Fiction:* Varn's blade catches him across the helm. He drops.
- GM ticks Evacuation Clock: 4/5.

**Round 5 – Ironmask Rages**
- Alone and *Off-Balance*, the Ironmask attacks wildly. MIG Strike vs. Kira with Burden.
- *Roll:* 5d6 keep worst 4 (1, 2, 4, 5, 6) = 12. Margin -2.
- *Result:* **Partial Success**.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock fills (4/4)—she is taken out! But the attack damages the bridge further.
- *Fiction:* His blade catches her shoulder. She falls back, rolling toward the far end of the bridge. "Kira!"

> *Tactical Note: The Partial Success still takes Kira out of the fight, but the cost—bridge damage—matters for what comes next.*

**Round 5 continued – Varn Holds Alone**
- Varn must hold one more round. He uses **Defend/Withdraw** to block the Ironmask's path without attacking.
- *Roll:* MIG Check vs. DC 16. 4d6 (3, 4, 5, 6) = 18. Margin +2.
- *Result:* **Full Success**.
- *Effect:* Varn holds the line. The Ironmask cannot advance.
- *Fiction:* "You cannot save them all," the Ironmask snarls. Varn says nothing, shield up, bleeding, immovable.
- GM ticks Evacuation Clock: 5/5. **Evacuation complete.**

**Resolution – The Bridge Falls**
- With civilians safe, Varn backs away and cuts the bridge ropes. The *Damaged* and *Rickety* Tags make this automatic.
- *Fiction:* The Ironmask lunges, but the bridge collapses beneath him. He catches a rope, dangling over the gorge. Varn doesn't look back.

**Outcome:** Civilians evacuated. Kira is wounded but alive (taken out means she is out of combat, not dead—per the stakes). Varn has 2/4 on his Clock. The Ironmask survives—he will return. The Evacuation Clock reaching 5/5 before both PCs went down meant victory.

> *Post-Combat Analysis: This fight shows how defensive play and environmental manipulation can defeat a superior enemy. Kira's Round 4 Maneuver using the Rickety Tag was the key moment—direct confrontation with the Ironmask was suicide, but exploiting the terrain created options. The parallel Evacuation Clock created tension separate from combat success.*

### Putting It Together

A typical combat turn might look like this:

1. The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.
1. You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.
1. The GM sets DC, notes any Edge/Burden, and clarifies stakes.
1. You roll **4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.
1. The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.

Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when Edge and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a series of disconnected attacks.

The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs, VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre-flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.

### Chapter Summary

Combat uses the same Check system as other scenes, focused through Resolve Clocks, core combat actions (**Strike**, **Maneuver**, **Set Up**, **Defend/Withdraw**), and environmental Tags. Choose an initiative mode that fits the scene tone—Conversational for dramatic pacing, Popcorn for dynamic flow, or Rolled for tactical precision. Use the Turn Structure Summary table to quickly reference what each action accomplishes. Size Resolve Clocks appropriately (4-segment for mooks, 6-segment for standard threats, 8-segment for bosses) and advance them according to outcome tier (1-2 segments on Full Success, 2-3 on Critical). The worked examples demonstrate how Clocks, Tags, Conditions, and tactical decisions combine into dynamic fights with meaningful stakes—whether a tense duel, a coordinated ambush, or a desperate last stand.
