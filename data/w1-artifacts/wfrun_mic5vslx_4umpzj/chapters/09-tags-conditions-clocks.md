## 9. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive. They connect description to mechanics so that rain, fear, injuries, crowds, and looming deadlines all matter at the table. This chapter explains what each of these tools is for, how to use them, and how they interact with Checks.

### Tags vs. Conditions

**Tags** describe **the environment or situation**. They belong to places, scenes, objects, or circumstances: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, *Crowded*, *Fragile Cover*. Tags affect what you can do in a space and how you do it.

**Conditions** describe **your character's state**. They follow you from one location to the next until cleared: *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*, *Frightened*, *Restrained*. Conditions affect your actions wherever you go.

Tags and Conditions are the shared vocabulary the table uses to talk about advantages, risks, and lingering consequences. They are not extra subsystems to memorize. They are the names you give to things you are already describing.

### What Tags Do

A Tag is a short descriptor applied to a scene, location, object, or situation. It becomes a flag: "remember this when resolving actions here." Tags typically:

- Grant Edge or Burden on certain Checks.
- Raise or lower DCs for specific actions.
- Change position or effect (how risky an action feels or how big its impact is).

You do not tag every detail. A room is just a room until its darkness, instability, crowd, or sacred significance matters to what characters are attempting. Tag the things that will shape decisions.

### How Tags Affect Checks

Tags typically grant +1 Edge when favorable or -1 Burden when unfavorable. Multiple Tags stack up to a +/-2 cap. GMs may also adjust DC by 2 instead of applying Edge or Burden when that better fits the fiction.

**The Core Principle:** A Tag that helps your action grants +1 Edge. A Tag that hinders your action imposes -1 Burden. When multiple Tags apply, combine their effects but cap the total at +2 Edge or -2 Burden.

**Alternative Approach:** Instead of Edge or Burden, the GM may adjust the DC by 2 in either direction. This is useful when the Tag affects difficulty rather than your chances of performing well.

> **Example - Single Tag Application**
> A character attempts to sneak past guards in a room marked *Dim Light*. The darkness helps concealment, so the GM grants +1 Edge on the Stealth Check. The character rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4.

> **Example - Multiple Tags Stacking**
> The same character is sneaking through a *Dim Light* warehouse that is also *Cluttered* with crates providing hiding spots. Both Tags favor stealth, so the GM grants +2 Edge (the maximum). The character rolls 6d6 and keeps the best 4.

> **Example - Opposing Tags**
> A character tries to climb a wall that is *Slick* from rain but has *Abundant Handholds*. The *Slick* Tag would impose -1 Burden, while *Abundant Handholds* would grant +1 Edge. These cancel out, so the character rolls a standard 4d6 with no modifier.

> **Example - DC Adjustment Instead of Edge/Burden**
> A character attempts to pick a lock in *Total Darkness*. Rather than imposing Burden (which still gives a chance of success), the GM decides the darkness makes the task fundamentally harder and increases DC from 14 to 16. The character's skill matters more than luck here.

### Common Tags Quick Reference

> Use this table during play to quickly identify how Tags affect actions.
>
> **Environmental Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Burden on vision-based actions; Edge on Stealth | Dusk, candlelight, fog, shuttered windows |
> | *Darkness* | Severe Burden or impossible for sight-based tasks | Night without light sources, underground |
> | *Slick* | Burden on movement and balance Checks | Rain, ice, oil spills, wet stone |
> | *Cramped* | Burden on wide swings and large movements | Narrow passages, crowded rooms, tunnels |
> | *Elevated* | Edge on ranged attacks from above; risk of falling | Rooftops, balconies, cliff edges |
> | *Solid Cover* | Edge on defense; blocks line of sight | Stone walls, heavy furniture, vehicles |
> | *Fragile Cover* | Limited protection; can be destroyed | Wooden crates, thin walls, market stalls |
> | *Unstable* | Risk of collapse; Burden on careful actions | Old bridges, crumbling floors, scaffolding |
>
> **Situational Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Outnumbered* | Burden on defense; enemies may gang up | Multiple foes vs. fewer defenders |
> | *Flanked* | Burden on defense against flanking attacks | Enemies on opposite sides |
> | *Surprised* | Cannot act in first round; Burden on initial reactions | Ambush, failed awareness Check |
> | *Exposed* | Burden on defense; easy target | No cover, caught in open ground |
> | *Hazardous* | Risk of harm from environment; may tick threat Clocks | Fire, toxic fumes, electrical danger |
> | *Surveillance* | Actions may be observed and reported | Guards, cameras, informants nearby |
>
> **Atmospheric Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Tense* | Social missteps escalate quickly; Burden on calming actions | Standoffs, negotiations, high stakes |
> | *Chaotic* | Burden on coordination; opportunities for misdirection | Riots, battles, emergencies |
> | *Formal* | Burden on informal approaches; Edge for proper etiquette | Courts, ceremonies, official meetings |
> | *Suspicious* | Burden on trust-building; increased scrutiny | After crimes, with strangers, in enemy territory |

You can invent new Tags that fit your setting. The important part is agreeing at the table what a Tag does in practice: which actions it helps, which it hinders, and how it shapes consequences.

> **Example - Tags in a Warehouse Fight**
> The GM describes a warehouse full of stacked crates, narrow aisles, and oil-spotted floors. They assign the Tags *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, and *Slick*.
> *Cramped* makes wide swings and large weapons awkward. *Fragile Cover* means wooden crates can be shredded by fire, potentially stripping cover away. *Slick* imposes Burden on fast movement or acrobatic maneuvers. Every decision in this scene now has texture.

### What Conditions Do

Conditions represent persistent states that modify what a character can safely attempt. They are the mechanical mark left by consequences. When something important happens to you—injury, fear, strain, affliction—it often becomes a Condition.

Conditions typically:

- Impose Burden on certain actions.
- Limit available options (cannot run, cannot act this turn, cannot speak clearly).
- Threaten further harm if ignored (ongoing damage, ticking Clocks).

### How Conditions Affect Checks

Like Tags, Conditions typically impose -1 Burden on relevant actions. Multiple Conditions can stack up to the -2 Burden cap. The GM may instead adjust DC by 2 when the Condition affects task difficulty rather than performance quality.

> **Example - Condition Imposing Burden**
> A character with the *Exhausted* Condition attempts to sprint across a courtyard. Physical exertion while exhausted is harder, so the GM imposes -1 Burden on the AGI-based Check. The character rolls 5d6 and keeps the worst 4.

> **Example - Multiple Conditions Stacking**
> A character who is both *Exhausted* and *Wounded* tries to climb a fence while fleeing pursuit. Both Conditions affect physical performance, so the GM imposes -2 Burden (the maximum). The character rolls 6d6 and keeps the worst 4.

> **Example - Condition Limiting Options**
> A character with the *Restrained* Condition cannot simply run away. Before attempting to flee, they must first break free or receive help. The Condition does not just impose Burden—it changes what actions are available.

### Examples of Common Conditions

A full alphabetical list appears in the Glossary. Here are a few you will see often:

- **Exhausted** - Burden on demanding physical actions until you rest or receive meaningful aid.
- **Bleeding** - Time pressure from an untreated wound. If not stabilized, it may tick a personal Clock or escalate to worse states.
- **Restrained** - You are held or pinned. You cannot move freely and must break free or be helped.
- **Dazed** - Disoriented; Burden on perception and reaction until you recover.
- **Frightened** - Burden on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when you rally, escape, or defeat the source.

> **Example - From Event to Condition**
> A character fails a Check while crossing a compromised catwalk. Rather than simple damage, the GM describes how they slam into the railing and twist their knee. They gain the Condition *Exhausted* or *Weakened*, representing reduced stamina. Future physical actions are harder until they rest or receive treatment.

| *Blinded* | Condition | -2 Burden on sight-based actions; some actions impossible | Flash, injury, darkness | Restore sight, adapt approach |

> **Note**
> This table covers the most common Tags and Conditions. GMs and players can create new ones as needed. When inventing new Tags or Conditions, specify: the mechanical effect (Edge, Burden, or DC adjustment), what triggers it, and how it clears.

### Using Tags and Conditions with Checks

Tags and Conditions do not require new rules. They plug directly into the Check system:

- Tags often grant Edge or Burden on Checks that interact with them.
- Conditions usually impose Burden or limit which approaches are reasonable.
- Some Tags shift DCs or change position and effect instead of modifying dice directly.

When you are about to roll, quickly review which Tags and Conditions are relevant. Ask: "Does this make the action easier, harder, or riskier?" Then adjust Edge/Burden, DC, or consequences accordingly.

> **Example - Tag and Condition Interaction**
> In a horror-tinged mystery, a character stalks through a foggy graveyard at night. The scene has Tags *Dim Light* and *Obscured*. The character is also *Frightened* from a previous encounter.
> When they attempt to sneak past patrolling figures, *Dim Light* and *Obscured* might grant Edge on Stealth, but *Frightened* could impose Burden on actions taken while the threat is visible. The GM weighs these factors, cancels opposing modifiers as needed, and describes how the character's shaky nerves show up in the fiction.

### Introducing and Clearing Conditions

Conditions should follow naturally from events. A failed Check in a hazardous area might cause *Bleeding* or *Poisoned*. Exposure to overwhelming sights might cause *Frightened*. Pushing beyond safe limits might cause *Exhausted*.

When you introduce a Condition, state:

- What it represents in the fiction.
- How it affects actions (which Checks it modifies and how).
- How it can be cleared (time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock).

Minor Conditions should clear quickly once addressed. Major Conditions may persist across several scenes or form the basis for character-driven goals.

### What Clocks Are

Clocks are segmented trackers that answer "how close are we?" for goals and threats. A Clock is a circle or track divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments. As actions succeed, time passes, or events occur, segments fill. When the Clock completes, something happens.

Use Clocks to represent:

- **Long-term goals** - Research projects, faction plans, character endeavors.
- **Mounting threats** - Approaching storms, advancing enemies, spreading plagues.
- **Ticking dangers** - Rituals completing, bombs counting down, collapsing structures.
- **Faction projects** - Off-screen activities of NPCs and organizations.

### Clock Advancement Guide

Understanding when and how Clocks advance is crucial for pacing and tension. Use these guidelines:

> **Clock Advancement by Outcome**
>
> | Outcome Tier | Progress Clock Effect | Threat Clock Effect |
> |--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
> | **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments | No threat advance |
> | **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments | No threat advance |
> | **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment | May tick threat Clock 1 segment |
> | **Failure** | No progress | Tick threat Clock 1-2 segments |
> | **Critical Failure** | No progress | Tick threat Clock 2-3 segments |

#### Multi-Clock Guidance

When multiple Clocks are active, use this decision process:

1. **Identify the primary Clock.** Ask: "Which Clock does this action most directly affect?" Advance that Clock based on the outcome.

2. **Consider secondary effects.** If the action is loud, risky, or draws attention, ask: "Does this also affect a threat Clock?" If yes, tick it.

3. **Handle ambiguous actions.** When an action could affect multiple Clocks:
   - If the player's intent was clear, honor that intent
   - If uncertain, advance the Clock most connected to their stated approach
   - For truly split actions, consider ticking both at reduced rates

> **Decision Flowchart: Which Clock Advances?**
>
> ```
> Action Taken
>     │
>     ▼
> Does the action directly target a specific Clock?
>     │
>     ├─ YES → Advance that Clock based on outcome
>     │         │
>     │         ▼
>     │    Was the action loud, risky, or attention-drawing?
>     │         │
>     │         ├─ YES → Also tick the most relevant threat Clock
>     │         └─ NO  → Done
>     │
>     └─ NO → Which Clock is most affected by this approach?
>              │
>              ▼
>         Advance that Clock; consider threat Clocks if failure occurred
> ```

### Advancing Clocks

Clocks advance in several ways:

- **Success-based** - Successful Checks tick a project Clock forward.
- **Time-based** - Segments fill as scenes pass or as in-world time moves.
- **Event-based** - Specific narrative events advance background or faction Clocks.

Partial successes often advance a Clock and introduce a complication. Exceptional successes may jump a Clock by more than one segment. Failures might leave a Clock unchanged while pushing forward a related threat Clock.

### Opposing Clocks: A Worked Example

> **Example - Investigation vs. Cover-Up**
>
> The group is investigating a corrupt official while the official works to destroy evidence.
>
> **Clocks:**
> - "Expose the Official" - 6-segment Clock (investigation progress)
> - "Cover-Up Complete" - 4-segment Clock (enemy countermeasures)
>
> **Round 1:** The investigator searches the official's office.
> - *Check:* RSN-based Investigation against DC 16 (Tough—the office has been partially cleaned)
> - *Result:* Full Success (margin +2)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 2 segments. Found a ledger with suspicious entries.
> - *Threat Clock:* No advance—the search was quiet and unnoticed.
>
> **Round 2:** The investigator questions a nervous clerk.
> - *Check:* PRE-based Persuasion against DC 14 (Routine)
> - *Result:* Partial Success (margin -1)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 1 segment. Clerk reveals a name but is visibly frightened.
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 1 segment. The clerk will warn the official.
>
> **Round 3:** The official learns of the investigation and begins destroying documents.
> - *Event-based:* GM ticks "Cover-Up" 1 segment automatically (faction action).
> - "Cover-Up" now at 2/4 segments.
>
> **Round 4:** The investigator tries to intercept the document destruction.
> - *Check:* AGI-based Stealth against DC 16 (Tough—guards are alert)
> - *Result:* Failure (margin -4)
> - *Effect:* No progress on "Expose."
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 2 segments. Guards catch the investigator; documents are burned.
> - "Cover-Up" fills to 4/4—evidence destroyed!
>
> **Outcome:** The Cover-Up Clock filled first. The official escapes immediate exposure, but the investigator has partial evidence (3/6 on "Expose"). The story continues with new stakes: can they find other witnesses before the official silences them?

### Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

These tools are most powerful when used together:

- Tags set the stage: terrain, lighting, crowds, magical effects.
- Conditions show how previous events cling to characters and shape their options.
- Clocks track momentum toward outcomes that matter over time.

A single scene might involve a *Hazardous* Tag, characters who are *Exhausted*, and a "Structural Collapse" Clock. Every roll becomes a meaningful choice about risk, effort, and timing.

> **GM Guidance - Start Small**
> You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene. Start with one or two Tags that matter, a few Conditions that arise naturally, and a single important Clock. Add more only when they clarify the fiction rather than clutter it. When in doubt, ask: "Does this tool make the situation clearer and more interesting?" If yes, use it.

### Chapter Summary

Tags describe environments and situations; Conditions describe character states; Clocks track progress toward outcomes. Tags typically grant +1 Edge when favorable or -1 Burden when unfavorable, stacking up to +/-2. GMs may adjust DC by 2 as an alternative to Edge/Burden. Use the Quick Reference table for fast lookup of common Tags and Conditions during play. Apply the Clock Advancement Guide to maintain consistent pacing. When multiple Clocks compete, let the fiction guide which advances. These tools work together to make the world feel responsive and stakes feel real.
