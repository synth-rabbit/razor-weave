## 8. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

This chapter describes the core resolution engine of the game. Whenever a character takes an action and the outcome is uncertain, consequential, and within their reach to influence, the table may call for a Check. Checks turn intent and approach into dice, and dice back into story beats. Understanding how to call for, perform, and interpret Checks is essential for both players and the GM.

### When to Roll (and When Not To)

You roll when the GM calls for a Check. The GM should only do this when three conditions are all true:

- **Uncertainty**: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal conditions does not roll.
- **Consequence**: Failure or partial success would introduce tension, cost, or change. If failure just means "try again until it works," do not roll.
- **Agency**: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Do not roll for things entirely outside the characters' control.

If all three are present, a Check is appropriate. If one or more are missing, the GM either says "yes" and narrates success, or "no" and explains why it is impossible or out of scope. Checks are tools for focusing on interesting uncertainty, not a gate in front of every action.

> **Example - When to Roll**
> *Trigger:* A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous.
> *Assessment:* The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character's choices matter. The GM calls for a Check.
> *Counter-example:* The same character crossing a sturdy bridge in calm weather does not roll. Success is assumed; the story moves forward.

### The Core Check Procedure

Every Check follows this seven-step procedure:

1. **Declare Intent and Approach.** The player states what they want to achieve (intent) and how they are trying to achieve it (approach).

2. **GM Assesses if Check Needed.** The GM evaluates uncertainty, consequence, and agency. If all three are present, proceed. If not, narrate success or explain why the action fails without a roll.

3. **Determine Attribute and Modifiers.** The GM selects the relevant Attribute based on approach, identifies applicable Skills, and notes any Proficiencies that apply.

4. **Set DC.** The GM sets the Difficulty Class using the DC ladder, adjusting for fictional positioning. Note any Tags, Conditions, or circumstances that grant Edge or Burden.

5. **Roll 4d6.** The player rolls 4d6 (adjusting dice kept for Edge or Burden), adds the Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects.

6. **Calculate Margin.** Subtract the DC from the roll total. Margin = Roll - DC.

7. **Interpret Outcome.** The table identifies the outcome tier based on margin and describes what happens in the fiction. Update Clocks, Tags, or Conditions as appropriate.

> **Check Procedure Quick Reference**

> | Step | Action | Who |
> |------|--------|-----|
> | 1 | Declare intent and approach | Player |
> | 2 | Assess if Check needed | GM |
> | 3 | Determine Attribute and modifiers | GM |
> | 4 | Set DC and note Edge/Burden | GM |
> | 5 | Roll 4d6, add modifiers | Player |
> | 6 | Calculate margin (Roll - DC) | Player |
> | 7 | Interpret outcome, update fiction | Table |

### Declaring Intent and Approach

When you declare an action, you state two things:

- **Intent**: What you want to achieve in the fiction.
- **Approach**: How you are trying to achieve it.

Intent focuses the scene. Approach determines which Attribute, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and Conditions are relevant. The more concrete and grounded your description, the easier it is for the GM to set an appropriate DC and for the group to picture the moment.

> **Example - Intent and Approach**
> *Intent:* "I want to get the factory foreman to delay shipment of the crates."
> *Approach:* "I speak with her in private, emphasize the safety risks, and show her evidence of the faulty wiring we found."
> The GM recognizes this as a PRE-based approach with a relevant social Skill and possibly a Proficiency related to safety procedures or technical documentation.

### Setting DCs: The DC Decision Flowchart

Setting the right DC is one of the GM's most important tasks. Use this flowchart to guide your decisions:

**Step 1: Is This Fiction-Trivial?**
If a competent character could accomplish this task without meaningful risk or uncertainty under current conditions, do not call for a Check. Say "yes" and narrate success.

> **Example - Fiction-Trivial**
> A locksmith picking a standard household lock in her workshop with proper tools and no time pressure. No Check needed—she succeeds.

**Step 2: What Is the Baseline Difficulty?**
Consider the task itself, independent of circumstances. Use the DC ladder to establish the starting point:

| DC | Difficulty | Baseline Description |
|----|------------|---------------------|
| **12** | Easy | The task itself is simple; success is expected for anyone with basic competence |
| **14** | Routine | The task requires training or focus but presents no unusual challenge |
| **16** | Tough | The task demands skill, precision, or specialized knowledge |
| **18** | Hard | The task pushes the limits of professional competence |
| **20** | Heroic | The task is remarkable; few could even attempt it |
| **22** | Legendary | The task approaches the impossible; success would be remembered |

**Step 3: What Modifiers Apply?**
Adjust based on fictional positioning. Rather than changing the DC, consider whether circumstances warrant Edge or Burden:

| Factor | Effect | Examples |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Favorable Tags | Grant Edge | *Solid Cover*, *High Ground*, *Well-Lit* |
| Unfavorable Tags | Impose Burden | *Dim Light*, *Slick*, *Cramped* |
| Proper Tools | Grant Edge | Right lockpicks, quality rope, specialized equipment |
| Improvised Tools | Impose Burden | Using a knife as a screwdriver, makeshift bandages |
| Ample Time | Lower DC by one tier or grant Edge | Taking an hour instead of minutes |
| Time Pressure | Raise DC by one tier or impose Burden | Guards approaching, timer counting down |
| Allied Setup | Grant Edge | An ally's prior **Set Up** action |
| Relevant Proficiency | Grant Edge | Domain knowledge that directly applies |

#### Worked Examples by DC Tier

> **Example - DC 12 (Easy)**
> *Victorian Mystery:* A constable examines a broken window latch to determine if it was forced from outside. The damage is obvious, the light is good, and he has time to look carefully. DC 12 RSN-based Check.
> *Result:* With a margin of +2, he notices not only the forced entry but scuff marks suggesting the intruder wore hobnailed boots.

> **Example - DC 14 (Routine)**
> *Sci-Fi Station:* An engineer reroutes power through backup conduits during a planned maintenance window. The task requires training but conditions are normal. DC 14 RSN-based Check with Technical Work Skill.
> *Result:* With a margin of 0, she completes the reroute cleanly. Power flows through backup systems without incident.

> **Example - DC 16 (Tough)**
> *Cozy Town:* A baker tries to calm the mayor's anxious spouse before the festival speech, despite their history of disagreements. The social stakes are real and the relationship is strained. DC 16 PRE-based Check.
> *Result:* With a margin of -1, the baker calms them down but inadvertently promises to cater their anniversary party for free—a **Partial Success** with obligation.

> **Example - DC 18 (Hard)**
> *Fantasy Wilderness:* A ranger tracks a wounded beast through rocky terrain after heavy rain has washed away most signs. The conditions are poor and the quarry is cunning. DC 18 RSN-based Check with Tracking Skill, Burden from *Rain-Washed* Tag.
> *Result:* With a margin of -4, the ranger loses the trail entirely—**Failure**. The beast circles back, and now the hunter becomes the hunted.

> **Example - DC 20 (Heroic)**
> *Noir City:* A private eye attempts to tail a paranoid crime boss through crowded streets without being spotted. The target is experienced, watchful, and has counter-surveillance training. DC 20 AGI-based Check with Stealth Skill.
> *Result:* With a margin of +1, the detective maintains the tail successfully, following the boss to a secret meeting location.

> **Example - DC 22 (Legendary)**
> *High Fantasy:* A diplomat attempts to convince two warring kings to declare a truce in the midst of a battlefield, with arrows still flying overhead. This is a setting-defining moment. DC 22 PRE-based Check with Edge from a sacred artifact both kings revere.
> *Result:* With a margin of +5, a **Critical Success**—not only do the kings agree to parley, but the diplomat's words inspire nearby soldiers to lay down arms, beginning a true ceasefire.

### Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions

Rather than constantly adjusting the DC, the game often represents favorable or unfavorable circumstances through **Edge** and **Burden**.

> **Edge and Burden Quick Reference**
>
> | Modifier | Dice Change | Common Sources |
> |----------|-------------|----------------|
> | **+1 Edge** | Roll 5d6, keep best 4 | Good positioning, helpful Tag, ally assistance, right tools |
> | **+2 Edge** | Roll 6d6, keep best 4 | Exceptional setup, multiple advantages combined, perfect conditions |
> | **-1 Burden** | Roll 5d6, keep worst 4 | Unfavorable Tag, minor Condition, poor visibility, improvised tools |
> | **-2 Burden** | Roll 6d6, keep worst 4 | Severe Condition, multiple disadvantages, hostile environment |
>
> **Stacking:** Multiple sources combine into a single level, capped at +/-2. If you have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (e.g., +2 Edge and -1 Burden = +1 Edge).

Edge and Burden usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies, or prior setup actions. They represent the table's shared sense that the character is favored or hindered in this moment. Multiple sources combine into a single level of Edge or Burden and are capped at +/-2—several small edges do not create infinite Edge, and multiple problems do not push you below -2. If a character would have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (for example, +2 and -1 becomes +1) until only one side remains, then apply the final level.

Tags and Conditions described in earlier chapters provide a shared vocabulary for these modifiers: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, or *Exposed* might impose Burden; *Solid Cover* or *Marked* might grant Edge in specific contexts or to specific parties.

### Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

When a Check is called for, follow this procedure:

1. Roll **4d6**, adjusting the number of dice kept if Edge or Burden applies.
2. Add the relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects.
3. Compare the total to the DC to find the **margin** (Roll - DC).

The margin determines the outcome tier:

- **Critical Success**: Margin of +5 or more.
- **Full Success**: Margin of 0 to +4.
- **Partial Success**: Margin of -1 to -2.
- **Failure**: Margin of -3 to -6.
- **Critical Failure**: Margin of -7 or worse, or all 1s on the dice.

### Interpreting Outcomes

Every outcome tier should change the situation. The GM and players work together to describe what the dice mean in the fiction.

- **Critical Success** - You achieve more than you aimed for. Extra benefits, stronger position, or accelerated progress.
- **Full Success** - You get what you wanted with no significant cost. The scene moves forward cleanly.
- **Partial Success** - You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect. Momentum continues, tension rises.
- **Failure** - You do not achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Threats advance, resources strain, or positions worsen.
- **Critical Failure** - Things go significantly wrong. Use sparingly for dramatic beats: broken tools, dangerous exposure, or major escalations.

> **Outcome Tiers Quick Reference**
>
> | Margin | Outcome Tier | Typical Result | Example |
> |--------|--------------|----------------|---------|
> | **+5 or more** | Critical Success | Exceed your goal with bonus benefits | Pick the lock silently AND notice the trap behind it |
> | **0 to +4** | Full Success | Achieve your intent cleanly | Pick the lock without issue |
> | **-1 to -2** | Partial Success | Succeed with cost or complication | Pick the lock but make noise or damage your picks |
> | **-3 to -6** | Failure | Do not succeed; situation worsens | Lock resists; guards become suspicious |
> | **-7 or worse** (or all 1s) | Critical Failure | Significant setback or escalation | Lock jams; alarm triggers; tool breaks |

> **Example - Cross-Genre Check**
> *Trigger:* In a cozy town, a character tries to calm a panicked neighbor during a storm. In a sci-fi station, a character tries to reassure a frightened technician during a systems failure.
> *Roll:* Both are PRE-based Checks against DC 14 (Routine) with an appropriate social Skill. The cozy scene might grant Edge if the characters have a strong existing relationship.
> *Consequence:* Full success calms the NPC and stabilizes the scene. Partial success calms them but attaches a new obligation or rumor. Failure escalates the panic, spreading fear or misinformation.

### Partial Success Toolkit

Partial successes are where Razorweave shines. A margin of -1 to -2 means the character achieves their intent but pays a price. The cost should flow naturally from the fiction—what could go wrong in this moment? Use these examples as inspiration, organized by scenario type.

#### Combat Complications

When a character succeeds at a combat action but rolls a **Partial Success**, consider these complications:

> **Example - Take Damage but Succeed (Strike)**
> *Situation:* Kira lunges to disarm an opponent in a rooftop fight.
> *Roll:* AGI-based Check against DC 16, margin -2.
> *Resolution:* She knocks the blade from his hand, but he scores a cut across her forearm in the exchange. Tick 1 segment on the opponent's Resolve Clock, but Kira takes 1 segment on her own Resolve Clock from the wound.

> **Example - Expend Resources (Maneuver)**
> *Situation:* Marcus dives behind crates to avoid gunfire while repositioning.
> *Roll:* AGI-based Check against DC 14, margin -1.
> *Resolution:* He reaches cover safely, but his satchel catches on a nail and tears open. One item of the GM's choice spills out and is left behind in the open.

> **Example - Create Exposure (Set Up)**
> *Situation:* Yara feints to create an opening for her ally.
> *Roll:* PRE-based Check against DC 14, margin -2.
> *Resolution:* Her feint works—ally gains Edge on their next attack. However, Yara overextends and gains the *Exposed* Tag until her next turn.

#### Social Complications

Social **Partial Successes** often create obligations, spread information, or shift relationships in unexpected ways:

> **Example - Succeed with Obligation**
> *Situation:* Detective Chen convinces the informant to reveal the meeting location.
> *Roll:* PRE-based Check against DC 16, margin -1.
> *Resolution:* The informant talks, but extracts a promise: Chen must warn him before any raid. Chen now owes a debt that may complicate future operations.

> **Example - Success Draws Attention**
> *Situation:* Lady Ashworth persuades the duchess to support her charity.
> *Roll:* PRE-based Check against DC 14, margin -2.
> *Resolution:* The duchess agrees enthusiastically—so enthusiastically she announces it loudly. Now everyone at the party knows Lady Ashworth's business, including her rivals.

> **Example - Partial Information Given**
> *Situation:* The scholar tries to get the archivist to share restricted records.
> *Roll:* PRE-based Check against DC 16, margin -1.
> *Resolution:* The archivist provides the records, but only a redacted copy. Key names and dates are blacked out. The character has something, but not everything.

#### Exploration Complications

Exploration **Partial Successes** typically cost time, resources, or position:

> **Example - Succeed with Time Cost**
> *Situation:* Ravi picks the lock on the warehouse door while guards patrol nearby.
> *Roll:* AGI-based Check against DC 14, margin -2.
> *Resolution:* The lock opens, but it takes longer than expected. Tick 1 segment on the "Guards Approach" Clock. The group is inside, but time pressure has increased.

> **Example - Succeed with Resource Cost**
> *Situation:* Elena navigates her group through treacherous mountain passes.
> *Roll:* RSN-based Check against DC 16, margin -1.
> *Resolution:* They find the path, but the route is harder than expected. Mark off one unit of supplies (rations, torches, or similar) for the extended journey.

> **Example - Succeed with Position Cost**
> *Situation:* Jin climbs the cliff face to reach the cave entrance above.
> *Roll:* MIG-based Check against DC 16, margin -2.
> *Resolution:* He reaches the ledge, but dislodges rocks in the process. Anyone below is alerted to their presence. The group has arrived, but lost the element of surprise.

#### Investigation Complications

Investigation **Partial Successes** often provide information with caveats—incomplete data, false leads mixed with truth, or unwanted attention:

> **Example - Succeed with False Lead**
> *Situation:* Inspector Vance examines the crime scene for clues about the murderer.
> *Roll:* RSN-based Check against DC 14, margin -1.
> *Resolution:* Vance finds useful evidence: a torn button from an expensive coat. However, he also finds a planted clue (a monogrammed handkerchief) that points toward an innocent party. The GM notes privately which clue is misleading.

> **Example - Succeed with Exposure**
> *Situation:* Mei hacks into the corporate database to find shipping records.
> *Roll:* RSN-based Check against DC 18, margin -2.
> *Resolution:* She downloads the records successfully, but triggers a silent alarm. Security does not know who accessed the files yet, but they know someone did. A "Trace the Intruder" 6-segment Clock begins.

> **Example - Succeed with Incomplete Information**
> *Situation:* Brother Thomas researches the cult's history in the monastery archives.
> *Roll:* RSN-based Check against DC 14, margin -1.
> *Resolution:* He finds records of the cult's founding and early activities, but the crucial pages covering their current leadership have been torn out. Someone else has been here first.

> **Example - Succeed with Unwanted Discovery**
> *Situation:* Agent Park interviews witnesses about the suspicious fire.
> *Roll:* PRE-based Check against DC 14, margin -2.
> *Resolution:* Witnesses confirm arson, providing useful details. However, one witness mentions seeing Agent Park's own partner near the scene that night. The investigation has become personal.

#### Crafting Your Own Partial Success Complications

When none of the examples above fit, ask these questions to generate appropriate costs:

1. **What could go wrong mechanically?** (Resources expended, equipment damaged, time lost)
2. **What could go wrong fictionally?** (Attention drawn, information leaked, relationships strained)
3. **What could go wrong positionally?** (Cover lost, advantage surrendered, terrain changed)
4. **What could go wrong informationally?** (False leads introduced, incomplete data, unwanted discoveries)

The best partial success costs emerge naturally from the fiction. If a character is picking a lock during a tense infiltration, noise or time are natural costs. If they are negotiating with a crime lord, obligations or leaked information make sense. Let the scene guide you.

### Group Checks and Assistance

Many actions involve more than one character. Rather than rolling for everyone separately every time, the GM can use:

- **Assistance**: One character leads the action, another assists. If the assistance is credible in the fiction, the leader gains Edge or a small bonus.
- **Representative Checks**: One Check stands in for a coordinated group effort. The outcome tier describes how the whole group fares.
- **Split Risks**: Two or more characters each roll, and the GM focuses on the most interesting combination of results rather than tracking every detail.

Pick the method that best fits the moment. Use single rolls when you want quick resolution. Use individual rolls when it is important that different characters face different consequences.

### Checks and Clocks

Some obstacles are too big for a single Check. Instead, the GM creates a **Clock** with several segments. Successful Checks tick the Clock forward; failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks.

Use Clocks when:

- Characters are working toward a long-term goal, such as investigating a mystery or repairing a ship.
- A danger is mounting over time, such as a collapsing tunnel, spreading fire, or advancing enemy force.
- Two or more forces are racing toward different outcomes (opposing Clocks).

> **Example - Clock and Checks**
> *Trigger:* The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.
> *Clocks:* "Evacuation Complete" (6 segments) and "Flood Waters Rise" (4 segments).
> *Rolls:* Each scene, characters make MIG, AGI, PRE, or RSN Checks based on their chosen contributions—lifting sandbags, coordinating crowds, analyzing routes. Successes advance the evacuation clock; failures or partials tick the flood clock or create new complications.
> *Outcome:* Which clock fills first determines whether the district is saved, partially saved, or overwhelmed.

### Keeping Momentum

Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt:

- Use Partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action.
- Let Failures create new problems, reveal information, or shift the situation rather than blocking all paths.
- Allow retries only when the circumstances or approach meaningfully change.

The goal is not to punish characters for rolling poorly. The goal is to discover what happens next when risk meets intent. If the table keeps that in view, Checks will feel like natural beats in the story rather than interruptions.

### Chapter Summary

Checks are the core resolution tool: declare intent and approach, assess whether a roll is needed, set DC and modifiers, roll 4d6, and interpret the outcome. The seven-step procedure ensures consistency across all situations. Edge and Burden adjust dice rather than targets. Outcome tiers—from Critical Success to Critical Failure—shape consequences. Use the DC Decision Flowchart to set appropriate difficulties, and draw from the Partial Success Toolkit to create meaningful costs that drive the story forward. The quick-reference tables support play at the table, keeping the action flowing while maintaining mechanical clarity.
