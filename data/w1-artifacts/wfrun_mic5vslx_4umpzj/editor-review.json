  "summary": "All four chapters pass editorial review with high marks for style compliance, terminology consistency, and content quality. The modifications successfully address all five issues identified in the improvement plan. Chapter 8 (Actions, Checks, Outcomes) and Chapter 10 (Combat Basics) show exceptional improvement with comprehensive procedural guidance, worked examples, and quick reference materials. Chapter 6 (Character Creation) provides excellent onboarding with the Quick-Start box and archetype guides. Chapter 9 (Tags, Conditions, Clocks) delivers the mechanical clarity requested with complete quick reference tables and clock advancement guidelines. Minor formatting suggestion for Chapter 6 regarding Tag/Condition italics in archetype sections, but this does not warrant revision. Recommend proceeding to publication review."
