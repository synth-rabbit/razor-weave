## 7. Characters and Attributes

This chapter deepens the character framework introduced in Character Creation. It explains how
        Attributes define what your character is naturally good at, how those ratings interact with intent and
        approach, and how to think about Attribute growth over time. Skills and Proficiencies add texture and
        specialization. Attributes provide the core pillars those details rest on.

### Attributes Overview

Every character has four Attributes:

- **Might (MIG)**– Physical power, endurance, and resilience.
- **Agility (AGI)**– Speed, precision, balance, and reflexes.
- **Presence (PRE)**– Charisma, willpower, and social influence.
- **Reason (RSN)**– Logic, perception, memory, and analytical thinking.

Attribute ratings are small numbers that reflect how strongly each pillar shows up in play. During
        Character Creation, you assign a starting spread (usually 2, 1, 1, 0) across MIG, AGI, PRE, and RSN.
        Those ratings are then added to relevant checks throughout the campaign.

Attributes are always interpreted through the fiction. A high MIG character does not simply "have +2."
        They push through heavy doors, endure long marches, and soak physical hardship more easily. A high RSN
        character spots patterns, recalls obscure details, and notices when something does not fit.

### Attribute Ratings and What They Mean

Attribute ratings are intentionally compact. Most characters begin with values between 0 and 2. This
        keeps the focus on intent, approach, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and the `4d6` dice
        results instead of on large numerical bonuses.

As a general guideline:

- **0**– Unremarkable. You can attempt normal tasks with no special edge or penalty.
- **1**– Competent. You are noticeably capable in this area compared to an average person.
- **2**– Exceptional. You stand out in most situations that rely on this Attribute.

When you make a Check, you roll**4d6**, sum the dice, and add your Attribute rating (and
        any other bonuses or penalties). You compare that total against a Difficulty Class (DC) from the
        standard ladder (typically DC 12–22). The difference between your total and the DC is the margin, which
        determines the outcome tier. A higher Attribute nudges those margins upward without guaranteeing any
        particular result.

#### Why the 0–2 Scale Matters

The bounded Attribute scale is an intentional design choice, not a limitation. By keeping numbers small, Razorweave ensures that every point represents a significant capability difference while maintaining focus on the story rather than arithmetic. If you are coming from video games or other tabletop systems with larger stat ranges, understand that this compression is a feature: it prevents characters from becoming numerically invincible and keeps even high-Attribute characters engaged with the fiction.

Each point on the scale meaningfully shifts your probability of success. Consider a Routine Check against DC 14:

| Attribute | Approximate Success Rate | What It Feels Like |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| +0 | ~38% | You succeed when luck favors you. Stakes feel real. |
| +1 | ~50% | Coin-flip odds. You are competent but not dominant. |
| +2 | ~62% | You succeed more often than not. Expertise shows. |

These probabilities shift further with Edge, Burden, and other modifiers—but the baseline tells an important story. A +2 Attribute does not guarantee success. It provides a meaningful edge while leaving room for tension, surprise, and the consequences that drive narrative forward. The dice remain the primary variable, and your choices about intent, approach, and positioning matter more than raw numbers.

> **Note**
> If you are accustomed to systems where a high stat trivializes challenges, Razorweave will feel different. Here, even your strongest Attribute invites drama. A character with MIG 2 is exceptionally strong—and will still occasionally struggle with that heavy door. This is not a flaw. It is where stories happen.

### Choosing Your Starting Spread

During Character Creation, you assign a small array of values across your four Attributes. The default
        array is:

- One Attribute at**2**
- Two Attributes at**1**
- One Attribute at**0**

This spread creates characters who are competent across several areas with a clear primary strength and
        one relative weakness. You can think of this as your character's natural "starting shape" before Skills,
        Proficiencies, Tags, and gear are layered on.

A useful way to choose your spread is to ask three questions:

- Which Attribute describes how you most often solve problems when under pressure?
- Which Attribute fits your concept but should remain a supporting strength rather than your main focus?
- Which Attribute would be interesting to struggle with?

Answering these questions usually reveals where to place your 2, your two 1s, and your 0. You are not
        optimizing a build—you are deciding what kind of situations will feel natural, challenging, or risky for
        this character.

### Attributes and Archetypes

Different spreads suggest different kinds of characters. The table below offers a few example archetypes.
        You do not need to use these labels at the table—they are here to help you think about possibilities.

Example Attribute Spreads and Archetypes

| Spread                     | Example Archetype         | Notes                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MIG 2, AGI 1, PRE 1, RSN 0 | Front-line problem solver | Leads with physical action and presence; relies on others for deep analysis.      |
| MIG 0, AGI 2, PRE 1, RSN 1 | Scout or infiltrator      | Excels at movement and precision; must negotiate around brute-force obstacles.    |
| MIG 1, AGI 0, PRE 2, RSN 1 | Negotiator or leader      | Strong in social scenes; needs help when delicate physical work is required.      |
| MIG 1, AGI 1, PRE 0, RSN 2 | Analyst or investigator   | Solves problems through observation and planning; may struggle to command a room. |

Use these examples as prompts, not prescriptions. You can apply any spread to any concept. A physically
        powerful scholar or a socially adept scout can be just as compelling as the "expected" combinations.

### Attributes, Intent, and Approach

Attributes are chosen based on*how*your character attempts something, not on what they would
        like to roll. The GM listens to your intent (what you are trying to achieve) and your approach (how you
        attempt it), then chooses the Attribute that best matches that description.

The same fictional goal can be resolved with different Attributes depending on approach:

- Prying open a stuck hatch with brute force might call for**MIG**.
- Picking the lock or working delicate mechanisms might call for**AGI**.
- Coaxing someone on the other side to open it might call for**PRE**.
- Analyzing the structure to find a weak point might call for**RSN**.

This flexibility keeps Attributes tied to the story. You do not choose an Attribute from a menu. You
        describe what your character does. The Attribute follows naturally from that description.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Calling for an Attribute**When a player describes intent and approach, repeat back what you heard in your own words, then say
>         which Attribute you think applies and why. If the table disagrees, adjust together. The goal is shared
>         understanding, not surprise rulings. If two Attributes seem equally valid, choose the one that fits the
>         character's established habits, or offer the player a choice with different risks attached.

### Working with Low Attributes

A rating of 0 is not a punishment. It means your character does not naturally lean on that Attribute
        when things get tense. The game expects you to have at least one area where you are merely ordinary.

Low Attributes shape the story in interesting ways:

- A low MIG character might avoid direct contests of strength and instead look for tools, allies, or alternate routes.
- A low AGI character might favor careful planning over risky stunts.
- A low PRE character might rely on written communication, intermediaries, or quiet influence.
- A low RSN character might lean on intuition, experience, or other party members for analysis.

Play your weaknesses honestly and creatively. They provide hooks for growth, tension, and teamwork.
        When a situation hinges on your low Attribute, it does not mean you should stay silent. It means the
        stakes are higher, and failure may reveal something important about who you are.

#### Embodying Limitations as Character Identity

A low Attribute is not merely a mechanical gap—it is an invitation to develop distinctive behaviors, habits, and coping strategies that make your character memorable. The most compelling characters are defined as much by how they handle their limitations as by how they leverage their strengths.

**Low MIG – Physical Limitations**

Characters with low Might develop workarounds for situations that demand raw strength or endurance. Consider how your character:

- **Compensates with tools**: Carries a crowbar, lever, or block-and-tackle for heavy lifting. Knows where to find improvised assistance.
- **Delegates physical tasks**: Naturally steps back when brute force is required. Offers to keep watch, handle logistics, or provide moral support while others do the heavy work.
- **Avoids exhausting situations**: Prefers shorter routes over grueling marches. Rests more frequently. May have developed efficient movement habits to conserve energy.
- **Leverages positioning**: When physical confrontation is unavoidable, seeks advantageous terrain, weapons with reach, or surprise rather than trading blows.

> **Example**
> Tomas has MIG 0. When the group needs to barricade a door against pursuers, he does not stand uselessly—he identifies which furniture will wedge most effectively, directs placement, and watches for the moment when the door begins to give. His contribution is expertise, not muscle.

**Low AGI – Deliberate Movement**

Characters with low Agility develop caution and awareness around situations that demand grace, speed, or precision. Consider how your character:

- **Moves deliberately**: Takes extra time on uncertain footing. Places each step with intention rather than rushing. May appear overly careful to others.
- **Avoids precarious situations**: Chooses the ladder over the drainpipe. Takes the long way around rather than the narrow ledge. Voices concern when plans require acrobatic feats.
- **Prepares thoroughly**: Since quick reactions are unreliable, invests in preparation. Checks equipment twice. Scouts approaches in advance.
- **Accepts limitations gracefully**: Knows when to let the nimble party member handle something delicate. Does not pretend capabilities they lack.

> **Example**
> Mira has AGI 0. When the group must cross a rain-slicked rooftop, she does not attempt to keep pace with the scouts. Instead, she finds a different route—through the building—and meets them on the other side. Her path takes longer but carries less risk of a fatal slip.

**Low PRE – Quiet Influence**

Characters with low Presence develop alternative methods for social situations where charisma or force of personality would typically dominate. Consider how your character:

- **Prefers written communication**: Drafts letters, sends messages through intermediaries, or requests time to prepare remarks. The written word allows careful thought without the pressure of immediate response.
- **Builds influence through competence**: Earns respect by demonstrating skill, reliability, or knowledge rather than winning people over with charm. Actions speak where words falter.
- **Avoids the spotlight**: Lets others make speeches, deliver ultimatums, or command attention. Contributes from behind the scenes or through one-on-one conversations rather than group address.
- **Relies on genuine connection**: Forms relationships slowly but authentically. May have a small circle of people who trust them deeply rather than a wide network of acquaintances.

> **Example**
> Jin has PRE 0. When the group needs to persuade a reluctant witness, Jin does not take the lead. Instead, they compile evidence, prepare talking points, and hand the material to the party's more charismatic negotiator. The persuasion succeeds partly because of Jin's unseen groundwork.

**Low RSN – Instinctive Action**

Characters with low Reason develop approaches that rely on intuition, experience, or collaboration rather than analysis. Consider how your character:

- **Trusts gut instincts**: Makes decisions based on feeling, experience, or pattern recognition rather than logical deduction. Acts decisively rather than deliberating.
- **Asks for explanations**: When complex information arises, requests that others break it down. Not ashamed to say, "Explain it to me simply."
- **Values practical knowledge**: Knows how things work through experience rather than theory. Can fix a machine without understanding why the fix works.
- **Leans on trusted allies**: Identifies the party members who excel at analysis and defers to their judgment on matters requiring careful thought.

> **Example**
> Sera has RSN 0. When the group discovers encoded documents, she does not waste time puzzling over them. She hands the papers to the party's analyst and says, "Tell me who to confront when you figure it out." Her contribution will come later, when action is required.

### Roleplay Prompts by Attribute Level

The following tables offer questions to consider at each Attribute level. Use these prompts during character creation, between sessions, or whenever you want to deepen your portrayal. There are no right answers—only opportunities to discover who your character is.

#### Might (MIG) Roleplay Prompts

| Level | Questions to Consider |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0 | How do you compensate for physical limitations? What tools or strategies have you developed? When did you first realize raw strength was not your path? |
| 1 | When do you choose to rely on strength versus other approaches? How do you maintain your physical capability? What physical challenges do you handle confidently? |
| 2 | How do you use your strength to help others? What responsibility comes with physical power? When have you had to hold back to avoid causing harm? |

#### Agility (AGI) Roleplay Prompts

| Level | Questions to Consider |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0 | How do you move through a world that rewards speed and grace? What preparations do you make before risky movement? How do you contribute when the situation demands quick reflexes? |
| 1 | What kinds of physical challenges feel comfortable versus risky? How do you balance caution with necessity? When do you push your limits? |
| 2 | How did you develop your reflexes and precision? What activities showcase your agility? How do you perceive people who move more slowly or clumsily? |

#### Presence (PRE) Roleplay Prompts

| Level | Questions to Consider |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0 | How do you build trust without natural charisma? What communication methods work best for you? How do you feel in large social gatherings versus one-on-one conversations? |
| 1 | When do social situations feel comfortable versus draining? How do you prepare for important conversations? Who taught you what you know about reading people? |
| 2 | How do you handle the attention your presence attracts? When has your influence created unintended consequences? How do you put quieter people at ease? |

#### Reason (RSN) Roleplay Prompts

| Level | Questions to Consider |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0 | How do you make decisions without overthinking? Who do you trust for analysis when the situation demands it? What has your instinct gotten right that logic might have missed? |
| 1 | How do you balance intuition with analysis? What subjects have you studied or learned through experience? When do you know enough to act versus when do you need more information? |
| 2 | How do you explain complex ideas to others? What patterns do you notice that others miss? When has your analytical nature created distance from people who think differently? |

### Examples by Attribute

#### Might (MIG)

Might represents physical strength, raw effort, and bodily resilience. It appears whenever you forcefully
        move, lift, or endure something.

> **Example**
> **Example – MIG Check**
*Trigger:*A storm has washed out a small bridge. The group needs to move a heavy improvised
>         plank into place before the river rises further.
*Roll:*The GM calls for a MIG-based Check using**4d6**against DC 16 (Tough). The
>         character with MIG 2 and the appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`.
*Consequence:*On a full success, the plank is set and the group crosses safely. On a partial
>         success, the plank holds but the character gains a Strained condition. On a failure, the plank slips,
>         and the GM advances a flood Clock.

#### Agility (AGI)

Agility covers balance, precision, and quick reactions. It appears when you dodge, climb, sneak, or
        operate fine mechanisms under pressure.

> **Example**
> **Example – AGI Check**
*Trigger:*A character sprints across slick rooftop tiles to reach a signal mast before an alarm
>         spreads.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 18 (Hard) due to rain and height. The character with AGI 1 and a relevant
>         Skill rolls `4d6+1`. A hazardous Tag on the roof may impose Burden if the group ignored earlier
>         warnings.
*Consequence:*On a full success, they reach the mast in time. On a partial success, they make
>         it but leave evidence behind or trigger a lesser alarm. On a failure, they slip, and the GM ticks a
>         danger Clock or applies a Condition such as Exposed or Dazed.

#### Presence (PRE)

Presence governs social force, confidence, and emotional weight. It appears when you persuade, command,
        intimidate, or rally others.

> **Example**
> **Example – PRE Check**
*Trigger:*The group needs a nervous official to delay a shipment. A character steps forward to
>         make the case.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 14 (Routine) if the request is modest, or higher if the stakes are severe.
>         The character with PRE 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`. Helpful Tags (Shared History) or
>         Proficiencies (Bureaucratic Procedures) may grant Edge.
*Consequence:*On a full success, the delay is granted cleanly. On a partial success, the delay
>         comes with a favor owed or a complication. On a failure, the official refuses and alerts a rival faction.

#### Reason (RSN)

Reason covers analysis, pattern recognition, and careful observation. It appears when you investigate,
        deduce, plan, or notice hidden details.

> **Example**
> **Example – RSN Check**
*Trigger:*A character studies overlapping telegraph logs to determine whether a recent outage is
>         natural or engineered.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 16 (Tough). The character with RSN 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls
>         `4d6+2`. A relevant Proficiency (Telegraph Instruments) may lower the DC or reveal extra context on a
>         success.
*Consequence:*On a full success, they identify the outage as deliberate and tie it to a specific
>         region. On a partial success, they confirm it was engineered but only narrow the possibilities. On a
>         failure, they misinterpret the data and the GM advances a faction Clock based on that error.

### Multi-Attribute Actions and Teamwork

Many scenes involve multiple characters and overlapping actions. Instead of treating every moment as a
        separate Check, think about how Attributes combine across the group.

- One character might use MIG to hold a door while another uses RSN to bypass its lock.
- A PRE-focused character might draw attention so an AGI-focused ally can move unseen.
- Two characters with different strengths might both roll, with the table focusing on the more
          interesting result.

The GM decides whether each character rolls separately, one character rolls with assistance, or a single
        roll represents the group's combined effort. Whichever option you choose, keep intent and approach in
        view. Assistance should make sense in the fiction, not just on the character sheet.

### Attribute Growth Preview

Attributes do not change every session. They grow slowly across a campaign as characters reach important
        milestones, resolve personal threads, and survive significant consequences. Advancement rules appear in
        the Advancement and Long Term Growth chapter later in this book.

When Attributes do increase, the change should feel meaningful in the fiction. A rise in MIG might come
        after a season of hard labor or survival in harsh conditions. A rise in RSN might follow extended study,
        investigative breakthroughs, or hard lessons learned from mistakes. Treat Attribute growth as an
        opportunity to reflect on how the character has changed, not just as a numerical upgrade.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Signaling Growth**When a player increases an Attribute, ask them to describe one moment from the campaign that symbolizes
>         that change. Then add a Tag to the world, a new relationship, or an updated detail on the character's
>         sheet that reflects their growth. This keeps advancement grounded in the shared story rather than only
>         in numbers.
