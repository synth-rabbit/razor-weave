While the strategic plan target of 8.0 is not yet met and the delta threshold of 1.0 is not reached, all four dimensions show positive improvement with no regression. Practical usability showed strongest improvement (+0.7). Approve for human gate review; additional iteration may be needed to reach target 8.0.",
