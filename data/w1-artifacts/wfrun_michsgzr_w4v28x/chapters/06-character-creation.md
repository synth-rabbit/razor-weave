## 6. Character Creation

Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule before you start. This chapter guides you step by step with all the information you need to complete each stage.

> **New to TTRPGs?**
>
> If this is your first tabletop RPG, welcome! Here's what you need to know:
>
> - You describe what your character tries to do; the GM describes the world's response
> - Dice add uncertainty - you roll when success isn't guaranteed
> - Your character sheet tracks what your character is good at
> - There's no "winning" - the goal is collaborative storytelling
> - You can't break anything - the GM and rules help guide the experience
>
> This chapter walks you through creating a character step by step. Take your time, ask questions, and remember that you can always adjust details as you learn the game.

> **Quick Start: 15-Minute Character Creation**
>
> Need a character fast? This streamlined process gets you playing in six steps. Reference the full steps later for additional depth.
>
> 1. **Concept** - Write one sentence: "A [role/background] who [defining trait or goal]."
> 2. **Attributes** - Assign the standard array: 2 in your primary, 1 in two others, 0 in one.

### Meet Rella: A Complete Character

Before diving into the creation steps, here is a complete character to show what you are building toward. Rella demonstrates how concept, mechanics, and story elements come together into a playable whole. You can reference her sheet as you work through each step.

**Rella — The Technical Specialist**

**Concept:** Former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns.

**Identity Elements:**
- Name: Rella (she/her)
- Origin: Canyon relay settlement
- Profession: Telegraph maintenance and cipher analysis
- Habits: Thinks before speaking, keeps detailed notes, prefers quiet spaces
- Appearance: Practical layered clothing, steady hands, worn tool belt

**Attributes:**
| Attribute | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Might (MIG) | 0 | Physical labor was never her strength |
| Agility (AGI) | 1 | Steady hands and careful movement in tight spaces |
| Presence (PRE) | 1 | Quiet but capable of connecting when needed |
| Reason (RSN) | 2 | Analytical mind, pattern recognition, technical knowledge |

**Skills:** Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, Machinery Handling

**Proficiencies:** Telegraph Instruments, Precision Tools

**Gear:**
- Travel satchel
- Compact communication toolkit
- Notebook filled with cipher fragments
- Insulated lantern

**Background:** Grew up near a canyon relay hub, spent years maintaining communication lines and logging message patterns.

**Relationship:** Isten, a former coworker and mentor. Their friendship ended over a dispute about unsafe repair methods.

**Goals:**
- Short-term: Decode an anomalous pattern she intercepted
- Long-term: Understand where the strange messages originate

**Drive:** Avoid causing harm through her work.

---

Notice how Rella's elements connect: her RSN 2 reflects her analytical nature, her Skills describe actions she performed during years of relay work, her Proficiencies represent the specialized knowledge she accumulated, and her gear supports her technical role. Her background explains where these capabilities came from, her relationship provides story hooks, and her goals give her reasons to take action.

As you work through the steps below, you will see how each decision builds toward a similarly cohesive result.

---

### The Nine-Step Creation Checklist

Character Creation follows nine steps. Each step is self-contained with all the guidance you need to complete it. Work through them in order, checking off each as you finish.

---

#### Step 1: Choose a Concept

**Goal:** Define who your character is in one or two sentences.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Write a short phrase that captures your character's role, background, and defining trait
- [ ] Ensure the concept suggests what scenes you want to be in
- [ ] Verify the concept fits the campaign tone (discuss with your GM if unsure)

**Guidance:**

A concept is the short answer to the question: who is this person? It does not depend on mechanics or require a long backstory. Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for discovery.

| Weak Concept | Strong Concept | Why It Works |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| "Fighter" | "Retired scout with a guilty conscience" | Suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world |
| "Smart person" | "Former telegraph engineer searching for meaning in strange patterns" | Implies profession, habits, and motivation |
| "Healer" | "Field medic who refuses to let anyone die alone" | Shows values, experience, and emotional stakes |

**Questions to help define your concept:**
- What did your character do before the story begins?
- What makes them different from others in a similar role?
- What drives them to take risks?

> **Example**
> A player chooses the concept "former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns." This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours, delicate tools, and unanswered questions.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to describe your character in a single sentence that excites you.

---

#### Step 2: Define Core Identity Elements

**Goal:** Add personal details that make your character feel real.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Choose a name and pronouns
- [ ] Note their origin or home environment
- [ ] Describe their everyday role before the story begins
- [ ] List one or two notable habits or mannerisms
- [ ] Describe how others perceive them at first meeting
- [ ] Identify one or two key experiences that shaped them

**Guidance:**

Identity elements help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at once. Focus on details that connect to your concept.

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Name and pronouns | How others address them | Rella (she/her) |
| Origin | Where they learned to see the world | Canyon relay settlement |
| Former role | What shaped their skills | Telegraph maintenance technician |
| Habits | Behavioral shortcuts for roleplay | Thinks before speaking, keeps detailed notes |
| First impressions | How NPCs initially react | Quiet but competent, overlooked in crowds |
| Formative experiences | Emotional depth and backstory hooks | Years of isolated work, one unexplained message |

You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character.

> **Example**
> The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to describe your character walking into a room and how people react to them.

---

#### Step 3: Assign Attributes

**Goal:** Distribute your character's four core capabilities.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the four Attributes and what each represents
- [ ] Assign the standard array: one at 2, two at 1, one at 0
- [ ] Verify your choices match your concept
- [ ] Note which Attribute is your weakness and consider story opportunities

**Guidance:**

Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character approaches challenges when there is no time to prepare.

| Attribute | Abbreviation | What It Represents |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Might** | MIG | Physical strength, force, raw endurance, carrying capacity |
| **Agility** | AGI | Balance, coordination, stealth, quick reaction, fine motor control |
| **Presence** | PRE | Social force, confidence, emotional expression, leadership, performance |
| **Reason** | RSN | Logic, analysis, memory, structured thinking, technical understanding |

**Standard Starting Array:**
- One Attribute at **2** (your primary strength)
- Two Attributes at **1** (competent areas)
- One Attribute at **0** (your weakness)

No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability with room to grow.

> **Attribute Priorities by Archetype**
>
> Use these common builds as starting points. Adjust based on your specific concept.
>
> ---
>
> **Physical Archetype (MIG Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | MIG | 2 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | RSN | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Warriors, laborers, athletes, enforcers, survivalists
>
> *Secondary options:* AGI for mobile fighters, PRE for intimidating leaders
>
> *Example concepts:* Retired mercenary seeking redemption, dock worker who breaks up fights, traveling blacksmith with a past
>
> ---
>
> **Agile Archetype (AGI Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | AGI | 2 |
> | RSN | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Scouts, thieves, acrobats, sharpshooters, pilots, surgeons
>
> *Secondary options:* RSN for careful planners, PRE for flashy performers
>
> *Example concepts:* Rooftop courier who sees everything, circus performer turned spy, ship's navigator with steady hands
>
> ---
>
> **Social Archetype (PRE Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | PRE | 2 |
> | RSN | 1 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Diplomats, con artists, leaders, performers, investigators, negotiators
>
> *Secondary options:* RSN for manipulative schemers, AGI for charming rogues
>
> *Example concepts:* Ex-courier who knows everyone's secrets, traveling actor gathering intelligence, disgraced noble rebuilding reputation
>
> ---
>
> **Analytical Archetype (RSN Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | RSN | 2 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Scholars, engineers, doctors, detectives, strategists, researchers
>
> *Secondary options:* AGI for careful craftspeople, PRE for lecturers and teachers
>
> *Example concepts:* Telegraph engineer decoding strange patterns, field archaeologist piecing together lost history, medical examiner who speaks for the dead

> **Example**
> Rella is analytical and steady. Her player chooses Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0. This emphasizes her careful thinking, modest coordination, quiet presence, and relative physical weakness.

**When you finish this step:** Your Attribute spread should reflect what your character is good at and what challenges them.

---

### Skills vs Proficiencies at a Glance

Before selecting Skills and Proficiencies, review this comparison to understand how each works differently in play.

| Aspect | Skills | Proficiencies |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **What It Represents** | Actions you can take | Knowledge and tool familiarity |
| **When You Use It** | When attempting Checks | To justify approaches or gain Edge |
| **Example** | Stealth, Observation | Lockpicking Tools, Local History |
| **How It Helps** | Adds +1 to applicable Checks | Enables approaches or provides Edge |

**The Key Distinction:** Skills describe *doing* while Proficiencies describe *knowing*. A character with the Stealth Skill has practiced moving quietly and adds +1 when making Stealth-related Checks. A character with Lockpicking Tools Proficiency understands how locks work and owns the right equipment. Both matter, but they answer different questions about your character.

---

#### Step 4: Choose Skills

**Goal:** Select 3-4 learned abilities your character can rely on under pressure.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the Suggested Skills table below
- [ ] Select 3-4 Skills that fit your concept and background
- [ ] Consider creating custom Skills with GM approval if needed
- [ ] Ensure Skills support the kinds of scenes you want to experience

> **Understanding Skills**
>
> Skills describe what your character is good at *doing*. When a Skill applies to a Check, you add +1 to your roll result. This +1 represents competent training—the difference between someone who has practiced an action under pressure and someone relying on raw talent alone.
>
> Think of Skills as answering: *What actions has my character practiced?*
>
> When you attempt something related to a Skill you possess, you bring experience and training to bear, adding +1 to your Check. When you attempt something without a relevant Skill, you can still try—you just rely on your Attribute alone without the +1 bonus.

**Guidance:**

Skills are action-based competencies. They describe what your character has done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. When you make a Check, a Skill often shapes your approach.

Skills answer the question: what have you practiced enough to apply under stress?

| Category | Example Skills |
|----------|----------------|
| **Physical** | Athletics, Acrobatics, Climbing, Swimming, Endurance, Brawling |
| **Social** | Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Empathy, Negotiation |
| **Mental** | Investigation, Observation, Analysis, Research, Memory, Deduction |
| **Technical** | Technical Work, Crafting, Machinery, First Aid, Lockpicking, Piloting |
| **Stealth/Survival** | Stealth, Survival, Tracking, Navigation, Foraging |

**Skill Scope Guidelines:**

| Too Broad | Too Narrow | Just Right |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| "Good at everything physical" | "Tying sailor knots" | Athletics |
| "Social expert" | "Lying to guards" | Deception |
| "Technical genius" | "Fixing one brand of telegraph" | Technical Work |

**Custom Skills:** You may create Skills that do not appear on the list. Work with your GM to ensure custom Skills are grounded in the setting, clear in purpose, and neither too broad nor too narrow.

> **Example**
> Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels. When she makes a Check related to any of these Skills, she adds +1 to her result.

**When you finish this step:** You should have 3-4 Skills that describe what your character does well.

---

#### Step 5: Choose Proficiencies

**Goal:** Select 2-3 areas of specialized knowledge or tool familiarity.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the Suggested Proficiencies table below
- [ ] Select 2-3 Proficiencies that grow from your concept and background
- [ ] Discuss scope with your GM to ensure clarity
- [ ] Consider how Proficiencies change what your character knows automatically

**Guidance:**

Proficiencies represent narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines your character understands deeply. Proficiencies often do not require a roll. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is obvious, or how serious a risk feels.

Proficiencies answer the question: what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly?

| Category | Example Proficiencies |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Tools** | Precision Tools, Medical Instruments, Lockpicks, Climbing Gear, Navigation Equipment |
| **Knowledge** | Local History, Legal Procedures, Arcane Lore, Engineering Principles, Natural Sciences |
| **Social Contexts** | Court Etiquette, Criminal Underworld, Academic Circles, Military Protocol |
| **Environments** | Urban Navigation, Wilderness Survival, Underground Exploration, Maritime Operations |
| **Vehicles/Craft** | Small Watercraft, Ground Vehicles, Aircraft, Mounted Animals |

**How Proficiencies Work:**

Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they provide fictional authority:

| Situation | Without Proficiency | With Proficiency |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Identifying a mechanical fault | Requires a Check (DC 16) | Automatic recognition of common issues |
| Repairing delicate equipment | Check with higher stakes | Check with reduced consequences |
| Understanding technical documents | May not attempt | Can attempt with normal difficulty |
| Noticing environmental hazards | GM describes obviously | Character spots subtle signs |

> **Example**
> Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.

**When you finish this step:** You should have 2-3 Proficiencies that represent your character's specialized expertise.

---

#### Step 6: Determine Starting Gear

**Goal:** Select equipment that fits your background and supports your character's capabilities.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Record the basic gear package (all characters receive this)
- [ ] Choose up to three concept-driven items
- [ ] Select one weapon or dangerous tool if appropriate to the campaign
- [ ] Consider one custom item with GM approval if desired

**Guidance:**

Gear provides fictional authority, not numerical bonuses. It represents what your character already knows how to use and what situations they are prepared for.

**Basic Gear Package (all characters):**
- Clothing suited to their environment
- A backpack or satchel
- Basic travel supplies
- A personal item that holds meaning

**Concept-Driven Items (choose up to 3):**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Technical Tools** | Toolkit, precision instruments, repair kit, measuring devices |
| **Recording/Reference** | Field journal, reference notes, analysis cards, maps |
| **Navigation/Survival** | Compass, signal mirror, reliable lantern, rope and spikes |
| **Medical/Care** | Medical pouch, first aid supplies, herbal remedies |
| **Social/Performance** | Musical instrument, fine clothing, forged papers, contact list |
| **Combat (if appropriate)** | Pocket knife, baton, bow with arrows, simple sidearm |

**Gear as Fictional Authority:**

| If You Have the Right Gear | The GM May... |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Tools for the job | Lower the DC of related Checks |
| Equipment that fits the situation | Remove uncertainty for routine tasks |
| Specialized items | Provide access to approaches others cannot attempt |

| If You Lack Appropriate Gear | The GM May... |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| No tools available | Increase DC by one tier (e.g., DC 14 to DC 16) |
| Improvised equipment | Introduce complications on partial success |
| Wrong tools entirely | Require creative fictional justification |

> **Example**
> Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work.

**When you finish this step:** You should have a gear list that supports your character's role and feels personal.

---

#### Step 7: Establish Background and Relationships

**Goal:** Define where your character comes from and who matters to them.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Write 2-3 sentences about where you grew up and what shaped you
- [ ] Note what kind of work or role you had before the story begins
- [ ] Name at least one meaningful relationship (mentor, rival, family, friend, or enemy)
- [ ] Leave space for new relationships to emerge in play

**Guidance:**

Background provides context for your character's abilities and perspectives. Relationships give the GM material for scenes, challenges, and future story arcs.

**Background Questions:**
- Where did you grow up?
- What pressures shaped your early life?
- What was your everyday role before the story began?
- Why did you leave that life (or why are you still in it)?

**Relationship Types:**

| Type | Story Potential |
|------|-----------------|
| **Mentor** | Source of wisdom, possible debt or expectation |
| **Rival** | Competition, tension, grudging respect |
| **Family** | Obligations, love, complicated history |
| **Friend** | Support, shared history, someone to protect |
| **Enemy** | Danger, unfinished business, source of conflict |
| **Colleague** | Professional respect, shared knowledge, potential ally |

You do not need to define every relationship up front. Name one or two that feel important now. Add others as they emerge in play.

> **Example**
> Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. She names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing. Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods.

**When you finish this step:** You should have a sense of your character's past and at least one named NPC who matters to them.

---

#### Step 8: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads

**Goal:** Establish what motivates your character and what unresolved elements create story potential.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Define at least one short-term goal (achievable within a few sessions)
- [ ] Define at least one long-term goal (campaign-spanning aspiration)
- [ ] Identify a core drive (deeper motivation or fear)
- [ ] Note one or two personal threads (unresolved questions or tensions)

**Guidance:**

Goals and drives explain why your character keeps moving. Personal threads give the GM material to weave into future scenes.

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Short-term goal** | Concrete, achievable objective | "Decode the anomalous pattern I intercepted" |
| **Long-term goal** | Major aspiration that shapes the campaign | "Understand where the strange messages originate" |
| **Drive** | Underlying motivation or fear | "Avoid causing harm through my work" |
| **Personal thread** | Unresolved question or tension | "The mysterious origin of the pattern—who sent it?" |

**Goal Strength Check:**

| Strong Goal | Weak Goal |
|-------------|-----------|
| Specific and measurable | Vague or abstract |
| Connected to your concept | Disconnected from character |
| Creates story opportunities | Ends story or removes tension |
| Involves other characters | Achievable alone without conflict |

> **Example**
> Rella has a goal to decode an anomalous pattern she once intercepted and a drive to avoid causing harm through her work. A personal thread involves the mysterious origin of the pattern and who might have sent it.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to explain what your character wants and why they are willing to take risks to get it.

---

#### Step 9: Final Review and Campaign Fit

**Goal:** Ensure your character works as a cohesive whole and fits the group.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review all previous steps for internal consistency
- [ ] Verify concept, identity, mechanics, and story elements align
- [ ] Discuss with GM and other players how your character connects to the group
- [ ] Adjust details to create natural connections and complementary capabilities
- [ ] Confirm your character is ready for play

**Guidance:**

A complete character should feel like a coherent person. All the elements—concept, identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, and goals—should support each other.

**Internal Consistency Check:**

| Question | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| Does the concept match the mechanics? | High RSN for analytical characters, high MIG for physical ones |
| Do Skills reflect the background? | A former soldier should have combat or survival Skills |
| Does gear fit the profession? | Technical characters carry tools; social characters carry props |
| Do goals create story momentum? | Goals should lead to action, not avoid it |

**Group Integration Questions:**
- Why would your character travel or work with this group?
- What shared history or complementary goals connect you?
- What tensions exist that create interesting roleplay?
- What gaps in group capability does your character fill?

**When you finish this step:** Your character sheet is complete and you are ready to play.

### Worked Examples

This section presents two complete character builds with annotated decision-making at each step. These examples show different archetypes and explain the reasoning behind each choice.

---

#### Worked Example 1: Kira Valdros — Combat-Focused Character (MIG/AGI)

**Final Concept:** Former military scout turned bounty hunter who uses precision and overwhelming force.

---

**Step 1: Choosing the Concept**

*The player wants a combat-effective character who can hold their own in dangerous situations. They consider several options:*

| Option Considered | Rejected Because | Selected Because |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| "Fighter" | Too generic—no personality or history | — |
| "Retired soldier" | Common trope, needs more specificity | — |
| "Military scout turned bounty hunter" | — | Suggests combat training, tracking skills, and motivation to take dangerous jobs |

*Decision: "Former military scout turned bounty hunter" provides clear combat capability (military training), useful non-combat skills (scouting, tracking), and built-in story hooks (why did they leave the military? what do they hunt?)*

**Final Concept:** Former military scout turned bounty hunter who uses precision and overwhelming force.

---

**Step 2: Defining Identity Elements**

*The player builds on the concept to create specific details:*

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Name** | Kira Valdros (she/her) | Strong name that sounds capable; pronouns established |
| **Origin** | Border fortress settlement | Military backgrounds often come from frontier areas; suggests tough upbringing |
| **Former Role** | Scout and forward observer for garrison force | Explains both combat and reconnaissance skills |
| **Habits** | Checks exits when entering rooms; sleeps light; prefers high ground | Military training creates lasting behavioral patterns |
| **First Impression** | Alert, dangerous, professional | Bounty hunters project competence to attract clients |
| **Key Experience** | A mission went wrong, civilians died, she left the service | Creates guilt, motivation for bounty work (making amends), and emotional depth |

**Identity Summary:**
- Name: Kira Valdros (she/her)
- Origin: Border fortress settlement
- Profession: Former military scout, current bounty hunter
- Habits: Checks exits, sleeps light, prefers high ground
- Appearance: Athletic build, practical clothing, several visible scars, always armed
- Formative experience: Left military after a mission resulted in civilian casualties

---

**Step 3: Assigning Attributes**

*The player wants combat effectiveness. They review the archetypes:*

| Archetype | Fit Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Physical (MIG primary) | Strong fit—military training emphasizes physical capability |
| Agile (AGI primary) | Also strong fit—scouts need stealth and quick reactions |

*Decision: MIG primary with AGI secondary. This creates a character who can hit hard and move well, fitting the "precision and overwhelming force" concept.*

| Attribute | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **MIG** | 2 | Primary. Years of physical training; carries heavy gear; overpowers targets when needed |
| **AGI** | 1 | Secondary. Scout training requires quick movement; combat reflexes from experience |
| **PRE** | 1 | Tertiary. Enough social capability to negotiate with clients and intimidate targets |
| **RSN** | 0 | Weakness. Acts on instinct rather than careful analysis; relies on training over thinking |

*This spread means Kira excels at physical confrontation, handles agile maneuvers adequately, can manage social situations when needed, and struggles with puzzles or careful planning.*

---

**Step 4: Choosing Skills**

*The player needs Skills that support both combat and the bounty hunting profession:*

| Skill Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Brawling | Yes | Direct combat capability; fits military training |
| Athletics | Yes | Running, climbing, general physical actions; essential for chases |
| Tracking | Yes | Finding targets is core to bounty hunting |
| Intimidation | Yes | Useful for both combat (causing enemies to surrender) and negotiation (pressuring informants) |
| Stealth | Rejected | Would be useful, but player prioritizes direct action over sneaking |
| Observation | Rejected | Covered partially by Tracking; RSN 0 makes mental Skills less effective |

**Skills Selected:** Brawling, Athletics, Tracking, Intimidation

> **Why These Skills?**
>
> Kira chose **Brawling** and **Athletics** because her backstory as a military scout means she spent years training for physical confrontation and demanding field operations. These are *actions she performed repeatedly* during her service. When she makes Checks involving these actions, she adds +1 to her result.
>
> She took **Tracking** because finding people is what bounty hunters *do*—it is an action central to her current profession.
>
> **Intimidation** rounds out her Skills because projecting danger and convincing targets to surrender is an *action* that serves both combat and investigation scenes.
>
> Note that she did *not* take Stealth, even though scouts often move quietly. The player decided Kira's approach is more direct—she tracks targets down and confronts them rather than sneaking past obstacles. This is a character choice, not a mechanical requirement.

*These Skills create a character who excels at physical confrontation and pursuit, with social intimidation as a backup approach.*

---

**Step 5: Choosing Proficiencies**

*The player needs Proficiencies that reflect military background and bounty hunting work:*

| Proficiency Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Military Protocol | Yes | Understanding military structures helps when dealing with guards, soldiers, former comrades |
| Weapons Maintenance | Yes | A bounty hunter's equipment must be reliable; prevents gear failures |
| Wilderness Survival | Rejected | Useful but not central to the character concept |
| Criminal Underworld | Yes | Bounty hunters work adjacent to criminals; understanding this world helps find targets |

**Proficiencies Selected:** Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Criminal Underworld

> **Why These Proficiencies?**
>
> Kira took **Military Protocol** because it represents *knowledge* she absorbed during years of service—understanding ranks, procedures, and how military organizations operate. This is not an action she performs; it is context she carries that changes how she interacts with soldiers and guards.
>
> **Weapons Maintenance** is a Proficiency rather than a Skill because it represents *familiarity with tools*—knowing how to clean, repair, and maintain her equipment. She does not roll to maintain her sword; she simply knows how because of this Proficiency.
>
> **Criminal Underworld** represents *knowledge of a social context*. She understands how criminal networks operate, who to ask, and what language to use. This knowledge enables approaches (like finding black market informants) that would be impossible without it.
>
> Compare these to her Skills: Tracking is an *action* she performs (following trails, reading signs). Criminal Underworld is *knowledge* that tells her where to start tracking in the first place.

*These Proficiencies mean Kira automatically understands military ranks and procedures, keeps her equipment in working order without Checks, and knows how to navigate the criminal elements of society.*

---

**Step 6: Determining Starting Gear**

*The player selects gear that supports a combat-ready bounty hunter:*

**Basic Package:**
- Practical travel clothing (sturdy, weather-resistant)
- Military-style pack (organized, durable)
- Basic travel supplies
- Personal item: Dog tags from her unit (reminder of who she was)

**Concept-Driven Items (3):**

| Item | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Reliable sword | Primary weapon; fits setting and military background |
| Reinforced leather armor | Protection without sacrificing mobility |
| Restraints and rope | Bounty hunters need to capture targets, not just fight them |

**Weapon:**
- Sword (already counted above)

**Gear List:**
- Sturdy travel clothing
- Military pack
- Basic supplies
- Dog tags (personal item)
- Reliable sword
- Reinforced leather armor
- Restraints and rope

---

**Step 7: Establishing Background and Relationships**

**Background:**
*Kira grew up in a border settlement where military service was expected. She joined young, showed aptitude for scouting, and spent years on the frontier. A reconnaissance mission went wrong when she reported an enemy position that turned out to be a refugee camp. The garrison acted on her intelligence. She left the service after that, unable to reconcile her role in what happened.*

**Relationship:**

| NPC | Relationship | Story Potential |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Sergeant Marro | Former commanding officer | Still in the military; represents the life Kira left; possible source of contracts or conflict |

*The player leaves room for additional relationships to emerge—targets who become complicated, clients with hidden agendas, other bounty hunters.*

---

**Step 8: Defining Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads**

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Short-term goal** | Complete current contract cleanly | Establishes immediate stakes for early sessions |
| **Long-term goal** | Find a way to make amends for the refugee camp incident | Provides campaign-spanning motivation and emotional weight |
| **Drive** | Prove that her skills can protect instead of harm | Connects to backstory; explains why she takes certain jobs |
| **Personal thread** | Some of the refugees survived—where are they now? | Unresolved question the GM can use |

---

**Step 9: Final Review**

**Consistency Check:**
- Concept (military scout turned bounty hunter) matches MIG/AGI build
- Skills (Brawling, Athletics, Tracking, Intimidation) support combat and pursuit
- Proficiencies (Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Criminal Underworld) reflect background
- Gear (sword, armor, restraints) fits profession
- Goals connect to backstory tragedy

#### Worked Example 2: Delian Osk — Social/Investigative Character (PRE/RSN)

**Final Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden.

---

**Step 1: Choosing the Concept**

*The player wants a character focused on investigation and social manipulation rather than combat. They consider several options:*

| Option Considered | Rejected Because | Selected Because |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| "Detective" | Generic; needs more texture | — |
| "Con artist" | Fun but lacks investigative focus | — |
| "Journalist" | Good but player wants seedier angle | — |
| "Insurance investigator" | — | Combines investigation (finding fraud) with social skills (interviewing) and built-in moral ambiguity |

*Decision: "Disgraced insurance investigator" adds the "disgraced" element for story hooks—why were they disgraced? What did they do? This creates a character who knows how systems work but operates outside them now.*

**Final Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden.

---

**Step 2: Defining Identity Elements**

*The player develops specific details that support an investigative, socially adept character:*

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Name** | Delian Osk (they/them) | Slightly formal name fits professional background; gender-neutral presentation suits someone who observes rather than stands out |
| **Origin** | Major commercial city | Insurance work happens in urban centers; explains understanding of business and bureaucracy |
| **Former Role** | Senior fraud investigator for major insurance firm | Specific title suggests expertise and authority |
| **Habits** | Takes notes constantly; asks questions that seem casual but are not; never sits with back to door | Professional habits from years of investigation |
| **First Impression** | Forgettable until they start talking; then uncomfortably perceptive | Investigators benefit from being underestimated |
| **Key Experience** | Uncovered fraud that implicated powerful people; was discredited and fired rather than allowed to publish findings | Explains "disgraced" element and creates enemies |

**Identity Summary:**
- Name: Delian Osk (they/them)
- Origin: Major commercial city
- Profession: Former senior fraud investigator, current freelance investigator
- Habits: Constant note-taking, probing questions, situational awareness
- Appearance: Unremarkable clothing, plain face, sharp eyes, always has a notebook
- Formative experience: Discovered fraud reaching highest levels; silenced and discredited

---

**Step 3: Assigning Attributes**

*The player reviews archetypes for investigation/social focus:*

| Archetype | Fit Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Social (PRE primary) | Strong fit—investigation requires interviewing, persuading, reading people |
| Analytical (RSN primary) | Also strong fit—investigation requires analysis, deduction, connecting evidence |

*Decision: PRE primary with RSN secondary. The player decides Delian succeeds more through reading people and social manipulation than pure analysis. They get information from people, not just documents.*

| Attribute | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **PRE** | 2 | Primary. Interviews are their main tool; reading people, persuading witnesses, blending in socially |
| **RSN** | 1 | Secondary. Still capable of analysis and deduction; just not their leading strength |
| **AGI** | 1 | Tertiary. Enough coordination to handle basic physical tasks; can run if needed |
| **MIG** | 0 | Weakness. Avoids physical confrontation entirely; relies on wit over strength |

*This spread means Delian excels at social interaction and manipulation, handles analytical work adequately, can manage basic physical situations, and must avoid or talk their way out of fights.*

---

**Step 4: Choosing Skills**

*The player needs Skills that support investigation and social manipulation:*

| Skill Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Investigation | Yes | Core to concept; finding hidden information |
| Persuasion | Yes | Getting people to talk, share information, cooperate |
| Deception | Yes | Sometimes investigation requires pretending to be someone else |
| Observation | Yes | Noticing details others miss; reading body language |
| Empathy | Rejected | Covered somewhat by Observation; Persuasion handles social connection |
| Research | Rejected | Would be useful but RSN is secondary; prioritize PRE-based Skills |

**Skills Selected:** Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation

> **Why These Skills?**
>
> Delian chose **Investigation** because it is the core *action* of their profession—searching rooms, examining documents, following leads. This is something they *do* actively. When investigating, they add +1 to their Check result.
>
> **Persuasion** and **Deception** are both *actions* Delian performs regularly: convincing witnesses to share information, talking their way past gatekeepers, adopting false identities to access restricted areas. These are practiced behaviors, not just knowledge, and each adds +1 when applicable.
>
> **Observation** rounds out the set because noticing details—reading body language, spotting inconsistencies, catching lies—is an *action* that supports everything else they do.
>
> Note that Delian did *not* take Research as a Skill, even though investigators often review documents. The player decided Delian gets information primarily through *people* rather than archives. Their RSN of 1 can handle basic document review without a dedicated Skill.

*These Skills create a character who excels at finding and extracting information through social means.*

---

**Step 5: Choosing Proficiencies**

*The player needs Proficiencies that reflect the investigator background:*

| Proficiency Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Legal Procedures | Yes | Investigators need to understand how official systems work |
| Commercial Operations | Yes | Insurance fraud requires understanding business; useful for many investigations |
| Academic Circles | Rejected | Not central to the character's background |
| Urban Navigation | Yes | Investigators work in cities; knowing how to find people and places matters |

**Proficiencies Selected:** Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation

> **Why These Proficiencies?**
>
> Delian took **Legal Procedures** because it represents *knowledge* of how courts, contracts, and official processes work. They do not roll to understand a legal document—they simply know what it means because of years working adjacent to the legal system.
>
> **Commercial Operations** is similarly *knowledge*-based: understanding how businesses structure finances, where fraud typically hides, what documents matter. This Proficiency does not make Delian better at Checks; it tells them *where to look* and *what questions to ask*.
>
> **Urban Navigation** represents *environmental familiarity*—knowing how cities are laid out, which neighborhoods serve which purposes, how to find someone who does not want to be found. This Proficiency might grant Edge when tracking someone through the city, or it might simply let Delian attempt approaches (like using back alleys and service corridors) that others would not think of.
>
> Compare to Skills: Investigation is the *action* of searching and examining. Legal Procedures is the *knowledge* that tells Delian what they are looking at and why it matters.

*These Proficiencies mean Delian automatically understands court processes and legal documents, knows how businesses operate and where fraud hides, and can navigate urban environments efficiently.*

---

**Step 6: Determining Starting Gear**

*The player selects gear that supports an investigator who works through social means:*

**Basic Package:**
- Professional but unremarkable clothing (blends into business settings)
- Leather satchel (holds documents and notebooks)
- Basic travel supplies
- Personal item: A letter of commendation from their former employer (reminder of what they lost)

**Concept-Driven Items (3):**

| Item | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Multiple notebooks and writing supplies | Constant note-taking is central to their method |
| Set of forged credentials | Sometimes investigation requires being someone else |
| Contact list and reference documents | Years of work built a network; this represents that knowledge |

**Weapon:**
- Small concealed knife (for emergencies only; Delian avoids violence)

**Gear List:**
- Professional clothing
- Leather satchel
- Basic supplies
- Letter of commendation (personal item)
- Notebooks and writing supplies
- Forged credentials
- Contact list and reference documents
- Small concealed knife

---

**Step 7: Establishing Background and Relationships**

**Background:**
*Delian spent fifteen years as a fraud investigator for one of the largest insurance firms in the city. They were good—too good. When they uncovered a fraud scheme that implicated several council members and a noble family, they reported it through proper channels. The investigation was buried. Delian was accused of fabricating evidence, fired publicly, and blacklisted from legitimate work. Now they take private cases, operating in the space between legal and illegal, trying to do the work that matters while surviving on the margins.*

**Relationship:**

| NPC | Relationship | Story Potential |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Councilor Veth | Enemy | One of the people Delian tried to expose; still in power; would benefit from Delian's permanent silence |
| Marek, newspaper editor | Former ally | Believed Delian's evidence but could not publish; feels guilty; might help if approached carefully |

*Two relationships provide both threat (Veth) and potential support (Marek).*

---

**Step 8: Defining Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads**

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Short-term goal** | Build reputation as a reliable private investigator | Establishes immediate economic pressure and motivation to take cases |
| **Long-term goal** | Expose the people who destroyed their career | Campaign-spanning goal that connects to backstory |
| **Drive** | The truth matters more than comfort or safety | Explains why they keep investigating despite the cost |
| **Personal thread** | What happened to the evidence they gathered? Someone must still have it | Unresolved question the GM can use |

---

**Step 9: Final Review**

**Consistency Check:**
- Concept (disgraced investigator) matches PRE/RSN build
- Skills (Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation) support social investigation
- Proficiencies (Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation) reflect background
- Gear (notebooks, credentials, contacts) fits profession
- Goals connect to backstory injustice

**Complete Character Sheet:**

**Delian Osk**
- **Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden
- **Attributes:** PRE 2, RSN 1, AGI 1, MIG 0
- **Skills:** Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation
- **Proficiencies:** Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation
- **Gear:** Professional clothing, leather satchel, notebooks and writing supplies, forged credentials, contact list, small concealed knife, letter of commendation
- **Background:** Former senior fraud investigator; discredited after uncovering high-level corruption
- **Relationships:** Councilor Veth (enemy who silenced them); Marek the editor (guilty former ally)
- **Goals:** Build reputation as private investigator (short-term); expose those who destroyed their career (long-term)
- **Drive:** The truth matters more than comfort or safety
- **Thread:** Where is the original evidence they gathered?

### Reference Character Summaries

This section presents two additional character summaries for reference. These show final results without step-by-step annotation.

---

#### Reviewing Rella's Build

At the beginning of this chapter, you met Rella—a complete character sheet showing what the creation process produces. Now that you have worked through the nine steps, you can see how her concept informed every choice.

Rella's concept as a "former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns" drove each decision:

**Attributes:** Her RSN 2 reflects the analytical mind required for pattern recognition and technical work. AGI 1 represents the steady hands needed for delicate instrument repair. PRE 1 allows her to connect with others when needed, though she prefers quiet. MIG 0 acknowledges that physical labor was never her focus.

**Skills:** Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling are all *actions* she performed repeatedly during years of relay maintenance—watching for signal anomalies, moving quietly through narrow maintenance tunnels, repairing delicate equipment, and handling complex machinery.

**Proficiencies:** Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools represent *knowledge* she accumulated through her work—understanding how communication devices function internally, and familiarity with the specialized tools required to maintain them.

**Gear:** Her compact communication toolkit, cipher notebook, and insulated lantern all support her technical role and suggest how she spends her time.

**Background and Relationships:** Growing up near a relay hub explains her exposure to communication technology. Her relationship with Isten provides both history (a mentor who taught her) and tension (their falling out over unsafe methods).

**Goals and Drive:** Her desire to decode the anomalous pattern creates immediate story momentum. Her drive to avoid causing harm through her work adds emotional depth and guides her decisions.

When building your own character, trace these same connections. Ask: does each element grow naturally from my concept? If something feels disconnected, consider whether the element or the concept needs adjustment.

### Chapter Summary

Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the campaign. The nine-step checklist guides you from initial concept through identity elements, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, goals, and final review. Each step is self-contained with the guidance you need to complete it.

The Skills vs Proficiencies comparison table clarifies the distinction between action-based competencies and knowledge-based expertise—a common point of confusion for new players. Skills describe what you *do* and add +1 to applicable Checks; Proficiencies describe what you *know* and enable approaches or provide Edge.

The Attribute Priorities sidebar helps you select mechanical foundations that match common character archetypes. The worked examples demonstrate decision-making throughout the process, showing not just what to choose but *why* each choice serves the character concept—particularly for Skills and Proficiencies, where the annotations explain the reasoning behind each selection.

By completing all nine steps, you build a character who feels grounded, mechanically capable, and ready for play. Your character sheet represents a person with history, motivation, and room to grow as the campaign unfolds.

> **First Session Tips**
>
> - Don't worry about knowing all the rules - the GM will guide you
> - Ask questions whenever you're unsure
> - Describe what your character does, not what game mechanic you want to use
> - It's okay to fail - failure creates interesting stories
>
> Remember: everyone at the table wants you to succeed and have fun. Your first session is about learning the rhythm of play, not mastering every rule.
