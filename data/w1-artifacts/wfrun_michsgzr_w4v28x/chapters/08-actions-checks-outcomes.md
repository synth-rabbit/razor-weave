## 8. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

This chapter describes the core resolution engine of the game. Whenever a character takes an action and the outcome is uncertain, consequential, and within their reach to influence, the table may call for a Check. Checks turn intent and approach into dice, and dice back into story beats. Understanding how to call for, perform, and interpret Checks is essential for both players and the GM.

> **Check Procedure Summary**
>
> Follow these seven steps to resolve any Check:
>
> 1. **Player declares intent and approach** - State what you want to achieve (intent) and how you are trying to achieve it (approach)
> 2. **GM determines if a Check is needed** - A Check is only appropriate when three conditions are all true: uncertainty (outcome is not predetermined), consequence (failure matters), and agency (character can influence the result)
> 3. **GM sets DC using the DC ladder** - Choose the appropriate difficulty: 12 (Easy), 14 (Routine), 16 (Tough), 18 (Hard), 20 (Heroic), or 22 (Legendary)
> 4. **GM determines Edge or Burden from circumstances** - Assess Tags, Conditions, tools, assistance, and positioning. Net the modifiers (+1 Edge and -1 Burden cancel out). Cap at +/-2
> 5. **Player rolls 4d6, adds Attribute, adds +1 if relevant Skill applies** - With Edge, roll extra dice and keep the best 4. With Burden, roll extra dice and keep the worst 4
> 6. **Calculate margin (result - DC) and determine outcome tier** - Margin +5 or more = Critical Success, 0 to +4 = Full Success, -1 to -2 = Partial Success, -3 to -6 = Failure, -7 or worse = Critical Failure
> 7. **GM narrates the outcome** - Describe what happens in the fiction based on the outcome tier

### When to Roll (and When Not To)

You roll when the GM calls for a Check. The GM should only do this when three conditions are all true:

- **Uncertainty**: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal conditions does not roll.
- **Consequence**: Failure or partial success would introduce tension, cost, or change. If failure just means "try again until it works," do not roll.
- **Agency**: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Do not roll for things entirely outside the characters' control.

If all three are present, a Check is appropriate. If one or more are missing, the GM either says "yes" and narrates success, or "no" and explains why it is impossible or out of scope. Checks are tools for focusing on interesting uncertainty, not a gate in front of every action.

> **Example - When to Roll**
> *Trigger:* A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous.
> *Assessment:* The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character's choices matter. The GM calls for a Check.
> *Counter-example:* The same character crossing a sturdy bridge in calm weather does not roll. Success is assumed; the story moves forward.

#### When-to-Roll Worked Examples

The three-part test (Uncertainty, Consequence, Agency) is not always obvious. The following examples show how the same basic action can shift from "no roll needed" to "Check required" based on changing circumstances.

> **Example - Climbing a Fence**
>
> **Scenario A: No Roll Needed**
> Tomas wants to climb over the wooden fence surrounding the merchant's yard. He is alone, unhurried, and the fence has plenty of handholds.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* No. Tomas is reasonably fit, the fence is climbable, and nothing interferes.
> - *Consequence?* No. If he slips, he tries again. No time pressure, no observers.
> - *Agency?* Yes. Tomas can climb or not climb.
>
> **Result:** Two conditions fail. No Check. The GM says, "You pull yourself over the fence and drop into the yard. What do you do next?"
>
> ---
>
> **Scenario B: Now Roll**
> Same fence, but now city guards are pursuing Tomas. He hears their boots pounding the cobblestones behind him. Every second counts.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* Yes. Under pressure, even simple tasks can go wrong.
> - *Consequence?* Yes. If he is slow, the guards catch him. If he falls, he is exposed.
> - *Agency?* Yes. His speed and choices matter.
>
> **Result:** All three conditions are met. The GM calls for an AGI-based Check. DC 12 (Easy—the fence is still climbable, but time pressure adds tension).

> **Example - Recalling Facts**
>
> **Scenario A: No Roll Needed**
> Sera wants to remember the name of the magistrate who oversees trade disputes. She studied law for years and this is common knowledge in her field.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* No. This is routine knowledge for her background.
> - *Consequence?* No. She can look it up if she forgets; the information is not secret.
> - *Agency?* Yes. She either knows it or not.
>
> **Result:** Two conditions fail. No Check. The GM says, "You recall that Magistrate Velloran handles trade disputes from the River Court."
>
> ---
>
> **Scenario B: Now Roll**
> Same question, but Sera is standing before the magistrate's clerk, who is about to close the office. She needs to name the correct magistrate *right now* to file her petition before the deadline. Getting it wrong means her client's case is delayed by a month.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* Yes. Under pressure, memory can fail.
> - *Consequence?* Yes. Wrong answer means a month's delay for her client.
> - *Agency?* Yes. Her training and mental composure matter.
>
> **Result:** All three conditions are met. The GM calls for a RSN-based Check. DC 14 (Routine—she knows this, but pressure makes it harder to retrieve).

> **Example - Fixing a Machine**
>
> **Scenario A: No Roll Needed**
> Vance wants to repair a jammed printing press in his workshop. He has his tools, the machine is a model he knows well, and he has all afternoon.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* No. This is routine maintenance for him.
> - *Consequence?* No. If it takes longer, he just keeps working. No deadline.
> - *Agency?* Yes. His skill can fix it.
>
> **Result:** Two conditions fail. No Check. The GM says, "You spend an hour disassembling the feed mechanism, clear the jam, and reassemble it. The press runs smoothly again."
>
> ---
>
> **Scenario B: Now Roll**
> Same printing press, but Vance's tools were confiscated when he fled his workshop. He has only a borrowed screwdriver and a bent wire. The press must work by tonight to print pamphlets for the demonstration.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* Yes. Without proper tools, success is not guaranteed.
> - *Consequence?* Yes. Failure means no pamphlets, and the demonstration loses support.
> - *Agency?* Yes. His improvisation and skill can overcome the obstacle.
>
> **Result:** All three conditions are met. The GM calls for an AGI-based Check (delicate work without proper tools). DC 16 (Tough—improvised tools make a routine task significantly harder).

### The Core Check Procedure

Every Check follows the same basic loop:

1. The player declares intent and approach.
1. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
1. If needed, the GM selects an Attribute and relevant Skill, sets a DC, and notes any Tags, Conditions, or Proficiencies that might grant Edge or Burden.
1. The player rolls **4d6**, applies modifiers, and compares the total to the DC.
1. The table interprets the outcome tier (critical success, full success, partial success, failure, critical failure) and updates the fiction accordingly.

### Declaring Intent and Approach

When you declare an action, you state two things:

- **Intent**: What you want to achieve in the fiction.
- **Approach**: How you are trying to achieve it.

Intent focuses the scene. Approach determines which Attribute, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and Conditions are relevant. The more concrete and grounded your description, the easier it is for the GM to set an appropriate DC and for the group to picture the moment.

> **Example - Intent and Approach**
> *Intent:* "I want to get the factory foreman to delay shipment of the crates."
> *Approach:* "I speak with her in private, emphasize the safety risks, and show her evidence of the faulty wiring we found."
> The GM recognizes this as a PRE-based approach with a relevant social Skill and possibly a Proficiency related to safety procedures or technical documentation.

> **GM Guidance - Choosing the Right Attribute**
>
> The player's approach determines which Attribute applies. Use these key words to guide selection:
>
> | Attribute | Key Words | Character Is... |
> |-----------|-----------|-----------------|
> | **MIG** | Force, lift, break, endure, overpower, resist, hold, smash | Applying raw physical power or enduring hardship |
> | **AGI** | Dodge, climb, sneak, aim, balance, tumble, sprint, pick (locks) | Using speed, coordination, or fine motor control |
> | **PRE** | Persuade, intimidate, charm, deceive, perform, inspire, read (people) | Influencing others through personality or social skill |
> | **RSN** | Investigate, analyze, recall, deduce, plan, notice, research | Using knowledge, logic, or careful observation |
>
> **Same Goal, Different Attributes**
>
> The same objective can often be achieved through different approaches, each using a different Attribute. Consider a locked door standing between you and your goal:
>
> - **MIG Approach:** "I shoulder-charge the door, breaking it off its hinges." (Force the door open through brute strength. Loud, fast, but obvious.)
> - **AGI Approach:** "I kneel down and carefully pick the lock with my tools." (Bypass the lock through dexterity and precision. Quiet but takes time.)
> - **PRE Approach:** "I knock and convince whoever answers that I am here for an inspection." (Talk your way past the obstacle. Requires someone on the other side.)
> - **RSN Approach:** "I examine the door frame and hinges to find a structural weakness I can exploit." (Analyze the door to find the easiest point of entry. Takes time but might reveal a clever solution.)
>
> Each approach has different DCs, different risks, and different fictional consequences. A MIG approach to the door might be DC 14 but alerts everyone nearby. An AGI approach might be DC 16 but leaves no evidence. The GM sets DC based on what the character is actually attempting, not on the abstract goal.

### Setting DCs

The GM sets a **Difficulty Class (DC)** to represent how hard the task is under current circumstances. The system uses a standard ladder:

#### Standard DC Ladder

| DC | Difficulty | When to Use | Concrete Examples |
|----|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **12** | Easy | Favorable conditions, strong fictional positioning, minor obstacles, or when the character has clear advantages | Climbing a rough stone wall with plenty of handholds; persuading a friendly contact to share non-sensitive information; recalling common knowledge about a familiar topic |
| **14** | Routine | Standard conditions, typical challenges, no special advantage or disadvantage, baseline competent opposition | Picking a standard lock with proper tools; convincing a neutral stranger to provide directions; tracking fresh footprints on soft ground |
| **16** | Tough | Unfavorable conditions, skilled opposition, time pressure, or when the character lacks ideal resources | Convincing a suspicious guard to let you pass without credentials; climbing a smooth wall with few handholds; recalling obscure historical details under pressure |
| **18** | Hard | Hostile conditions, significant obstacles, high stakes, or active countermeasures from opposition | Disarming a complex trap while enemies approach; persuading a hostile official to overlook a minor crime; picking a high-quality lock without specialized tools |
| **20** | Heroic | Extreme conditions, exceptional challenges, pushing the limits of what trained individuals can accomplish | Leaping between rooftops in a thunderstorm; convincing a mob to disperse without violence; navigating treacherous terrain while wounded and exhausted |
| **22** | Legendary | Near-impossible feats, setting-defining moments, the absolute edge of mortal capability | Talking down a raging dragon mid-attack; climbing a sheer ice cliff during a blizzard without equipment; deciphering an alien language in minutes |

Start by imagining what success would look like in the scene and how far it is from effortless. Use lower DCs when characters have strong fictional positioning, good information, and safe conditions. Use higher DCs when time is short, the environment is hostile, or the task is at the edge of what is possible in the setting.

> **Note**
> DCs should reflect fictional positioning, not abstract difficulty. The same task might be DC 14 in good conditions and DC 18 in poor conditions. Let the story guide the number.

> **GM Guidance - Setting DCs in Practice**
> When selecting a DC, ask yourself: "What would make this task harder or easier?" Consider the character's preparation, available tools, environmental factors, and opposition awareness. A well-prepared character attempting a task in favorable conditions deserves a lower DC than an improvising character under hostile circumstances.
>
> **Quick DC Benchmarks:**
> - **DC 12:** Climbing a rough stone wall in good conditions—plenty of handholds, no time pressure, dry weather.
> - **DC 14:** Picking a standard commercial lock—common mechanism, proper tools, adequate lighting.
> - **DC 16:** Persuading a suspicious guard to look the other way—they have no reason to trust you, but no reason to be hostile either.
> - **DC 18:** Disarming a trap while under fire—you know what you are doing, but enemies are shooting at you and time is critical.
> - **DC 20:** Leaping between rooftops in a storm—the gap is wide, the surfaces are slick, the wind is unpredictable.
>
> Ground each DC in the specific, imaginable situation at hand. If you can picture the scene clearly, the right DC usually follows.

### Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions

Rather than constantly adjusting the DC, the game often represents favorable or unfavorable circumstances through **Edge** and **Burden**.

> **Edge and Burden Quick Reference**
>
> | Modifier | Dice Change | Common Sources |
> |----------|-------------|----------------|
> | **+1 Edge** | Roll 5d6, keep best 4 | Good positioning, helpful Tag, ally assistance, right tools |
> | **+2 Edge** | Roll 6d6, keep best 4 | Exceptional setup, multiple advantages combined, perfect conditions |
> | **-1 Burden** | Roll 5d6, keep worst 4 | Unfavorable Tag, minor Condition, poor visibility, improvised tools |
> | **-2 Burden** | Roll 6d6, keep worst 4 | Severe Condition, multiple disadvantages, hostile environment |
>
> **Stacking:** Multiple sources combine into a single level, capped at +/-2. If you have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (e.g., +2 Edge and -1 Burden = +1 Edge).

Edge and Burden usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies, or prior setup actions. They represent the table's shared sense that the character is favored or hindered in this moment. Multiple sources combine into a single level of Edge or Burden and are capped at +/-2—several small edges do not create infinite Edge, and multiple problems do not push you below -2. If a character would have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (for example, +2 and -1 becomes +1) until only one side remains, then apply the final level.

Tags and Conditions described in earlier chapters provide a shared vocabulary for these modifiers: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, or *Exposed* might impose Burden; *Solid Cover* or *Marked* might grant Edge in specific contexts or to specific parties.

> **Example - Combining Multiple Modifier Sources**
>
> Kira attempts to pick a lock on a warehouse door. The GM assesses the modifiers from multiple sources:
>
> - **+1 Edge** from her Lockpicking Tools Proficiency (she has the right equipment and knows how to use it)
> - **+1 Edge** from an ally's **Set Up** action (Dex watched the guard's patrol pattern and signaled the optimal moment)
> - **-1 Burden** from *Dim Light* (the alley is poorly lit, making precision work harder)
>
> The modifiers stack: +1 +1 -1 = +1 Edge total.
>
> With +1 Edge, Kira rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4. She rolls 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and keeps 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Adding AGI +2 gives her a total of 20 against DC 16. Margin = +4, a **Full Success**. The lock clicks open quietly.
>
> **Note:** Edge and Burden cap at +/-2. Even if Kira had four sources of Edge, she would still only roll 6d6 and keep the best 4. The cap prevents modifier stacking from overwhelming the dice.

### Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

When a Check is called for, follow this procedure:

1. Roll **4d6**, adjusting the number of dice kept if Edge or Burden applies.
1. Add the relevant Attribute rating.
1. **Add +1 if you have a relevant Skill.** Having a relevant Skill adds +1 to your Check result. This bonus is binary—you either have the Skill (+1) or you do not (+0). There are no Skill levels or ranks.
1. Add any other bonuses from temporary effects.
1. Compare the total to the DC to find the **margin** (Result - DC).

The margin determines the outcome tier. Use the following ranges to identify which tier applies:

#### Outcome Tier Margin Ranges

| Margin Range | Outcome Tier | Summary |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **+5 or more** | Critical Success | Exceptional result; exceed your goal with bonus benefits |
| **0 to +4** | Full Success | Clean success; achieve your intent without significant cost |
| **-1 to -2** | Partial Success | Success with cost; achieve your goal but pay a price |
| **-3 to -6** | Failure | Goal not achieved; situation worsens or complicates |
| **-7 or worse** | Critical Failure | Significant setback; major escalation or consequence |

> **Note**
> Rolling all 1s on your dice (before keeping) also triggers a **Critical Failure**, regardless of margin. This represents catastrophic bad luck.

### 4d6 Probability Reference

Understanding the math behind 4d6 helps you gauge your chances and make informed tactical decisions. The following table shows the probability distribution for raw 4d6 rolls (before adding Attribute or Skill modifiers).

#### 4d6 Roll Distribution

| Roll Total | Probability | Cumulative (roll this or higher) |
|------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **4** | 0.08% | 100% |
| **5** | 0.31% | 99.92% |
| **6** | 0.77% | 99.61% |
| **7** | 1.54% | 98.84% |
| **8** | 2.70% | 97.30% |
| **9** | 4.32% | 94.60% |
| **10** | 6.17% | 90.28% |
| **11** | 8.02% | 84.11% |
| **12** | 9.65% | 76.09% |
| **13** | 10.49% | 66.44% |
| **14** | 10.80% | 55.95% |
| **15** | 10.49% | 45.15% |
| **16** | 9.65% | 34.66% |
| **17** | 8.02% | 25.01% |
| **18** | 6.17% | 16.99% |
| **19** | 4.32% | 10.82% |
| **20** | 2.70% | 6.50% |
| **21** | 1.54% | 3.80% |
| **22** | 0.77% | 2.26% |
| **23** | 0.31% | 1.49% |
| **24** | 0.08% | 1.18% |

**Key Insight:** The average 4d6 roll is 14. With a typical Attribute of +2, you will average 16—enough for a Routine (DC 14) task with margin to spare.

### Success Probability by DC

This table shows your percentage chance of achieving at least a **Full Success** (margin 0 or higher) based on your total modifier and the DC. Use this during character building or tactical planning.

| DC | With +0 | With +2 | With +4 | With +2 and +1 Edge |
|----|---------|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **12** | 76% | 90% | 97% | 95% |
| **14** | 56% | 76% | 90% | 87% |
| **16** | 35% | 56% | 76% | 68% |
| **18** | 17% | 35% | 56% | 46% |
| **20** | 6% | 17% | 35% | 26% |

> **What the Numbers Mean**
>
> The 4d6 system creates a predictable, skill-respecting curve:
>
> - **Average roll is 14.** Slightly more than half your rolls (56%) land at 14 or higher. This makes Routine (DC 14) tasks achievable more often than not without bonuses.
> - **Each +2 Attribute shifts success by approximately 20%.** Going from +0 to +2 improves your odds—a +2 character has 76% success on DC 14, compared to 56% for +0.
> - **Edge adds roughly 10-12% success chance.** Rolling 5d6 and keeping the best 4 shifts your average from 14 to approximately 15.5, giving you about one point of effective bonus.
> - **The system favors competent characters.** DC 14 is "Routine" for a reason—a character with +2 in their relevant Attribute succeeds three-quarters of the time. The challenge comes from Tough (DC 16) and Hard (DC 18) tasks, where every point of modifier matters.
>
> **Practical Application:** If you have +2 in an Attribute and attempt a DC 16 task, you have a 56% chance of Full Success. Adding Edge improves that to 68%. This is why fictional positioning and setup actions matter—they can shift borderline tasks into reliable territory.

### Complete Resolution Walkthrough

The following extended example demonstrates the complete resolution sequence from scene setup through all five outcome tiers. Study this to understand how each step connects and how different rolls produce different narrative results.

> **Complete Resolution Walkthrough - Manor Infiltration**
>
> ---
>
> **Scene Setup**
>
> Lyra must infiltrate Lord Ashworth's manor during a dinner party to retrieve incriminating documents from his private study. The manor is busy with guests, servants move through the corridors, and guards patrol the grounds.
>
> *Relevant Tags:*
> - *Dim Light* (the servant corridors are poorly lit to keep them unobtrusive)
> - *Crowded Event* (many people moving about, both concealment and risk)
> - *Patrolled* (guards make regular rounds)
>
> *Lyra's Capabilities:*
> - AGI +2 (her Agility Attribute rating)
> - Stealth Skill (relevant to moving unseen)
> - Servant's Uniform (acquired earlier, provides fictional positioning)
>
> Her ally Marcus is stationed outside, watching the guard rotation and ready to create a distraction if needed. He spent the previous scene observing patterns.
>
> ---
>
> **Step 1: Player declares intent and approach**
>
> *Intent:* "I want to reach Lord Ashworth's study on the second floor without being detected."
>
> *Approach:* "I use the servant corridors rather than the main halls. My uniform lets me blend in if seen, and I time my movement to avoid the patrol routes Marcus identified."
>
> ---
>
> **Step 2: GM determines if a Check is needed**
>
> The GM applies the three-part test:
>
> - *Uncertainty?* Yes—the manor is active with servants, guests, and guards. Even with preparation, detection is possible.
> - *Consequence?* Yes—if Lyra is caught, she faces arrest, Lord Ashworth is alerted, and the mission fails.
> - *Agency?* Yes—Lyra's skill, preparation, and choices directly influence whether she succeeds.
>
> All three conditions are met. The GM calls for a Check.
>
> ---
>
> **Step 3: GM sets DC using the DC ladder**
>
> The GM considers the circumstances:
>
> - The servant corridors are less trafficked than the main halls (favorable)
> - Guards patrol but are focused on the perimeter and main entrances (neutral)
> - The dinner party creates ambient noise and movement (favorable for concealment)
> - The study is in a private wing—being seen there would raise questions (unfavorable)
>
> Balancing these factors, the GM sets **DC 16** (Tough—skilled opposition in the form of alert guards, some unfavorable conditions in the private wing, but good preparation).
>
> ---
>
> **Step 4: GM determines Edge or Burden from circumstances**
>
> The GM tallies modifiers:
>
> - **+1 Edge** from *Dim Light* (the poorly lit corridors favor stealth)
> - **+1 Edge** from Marcus's reconnaissance (he identified the patrol timing)
> - The servant's uniform is good fictional positioning but does not stack to another Edge—it is already factored into the DC being 16 rather than 18
>
> Net calculation: +1 +1 = **+2 Edge total** (capped, no additional sources matter)
>
> Wait—the GM reconsiders. The *Dim Light* helps Lyra hide, but it also makes it harder for her to spot guards before they spot her. The GM rules this is a wash for the stealth attempt specifically, so:
>
> - **+1 Edge** from Marcus's reconnaissance (timing information)
>
> **Final modifier: +1 Edge**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 5: Player rolls 4d6, adds Attribute, adds +1 if relevant Skill applies**
>
> With +1 Edge, Lyra rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4.
>
> **Dice rolled:** 3, 4, 4, 5, 6
> **Dice kept (best 4):** 4, 4, 5, 6
> **Dice total:** 4 + 4 + 5 + 6 = **19**
>
> Now add modifiers:
> - Attribute (AGI): +2
> - Skill (Stealth): +1
>
> **Final result:** 19 + 2 + 1 = **22**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 6: Calculate margin (result - DC) and determine outcome tier**
>
> **Margin:** 22 - 16 = **+6**
>
> Consulting the outcome tier table:
> - **+5 or more = Critical Success** (this one)
> - 0 to +4 = Full Success
> - -1 to -2 = Partial Success

>
> **Step 7: GM narrates the outcome**
>
> "You move through the servant corridors like a ghost. Marcus's timing is perfect—you slip past each patrol intersection in the gaps between rounds. A maid nearly bumps into you at a corner, but you step aside with a murmured apology, and she does not give you a second glance. When you reach the private wing, you notice something Marcus could not have seen from outside: the guard assigned to this corridor is asleep in an alcove, an empty wine bottle beside him. You reach the study door completely undetected—and you now know the guard rotation has a gap no one else has noticed. This information could prove valuable later."

The security chief's eyes narrow. 'You. Halt.' Ashworth's expression shifts from curiosity to cold suspicion. There is no innocent explanation for a servant in his private wing during a party. Guards are summoned. Your cover is blown, and worse—Ashworth now knows someone is interested in his private quarters. Even if you escape tonight, he will move or destroy those documents."

### Complete Check Example

The following example demonstrates every step of Check resolution with all numbers shown. Use this as a reference for how the full mechanical sequence works.

> **Complete Check Example - Warehouse Infiltration**
>
> **Scene Setup:**
> Vance needs to bypass a security panel to enter a restricted warehouse. The environment has the following Tags:
> - *Dim Light* (the loading dock has minimal lighting)
> - *Patrolled* (guards make regular rounds)
>
> Vance has:
> - AGI +2 (his Agility Attribute rating)
> - Technical Work Skill (relevant to bypassing security systems)
> - Electronic Systems Proficiency (he knows this type of panel)
>
> His ally Sera spent the previous scene observing the guard rotation and panel model, providing useful intelligence.
>
> ---
>
> **Step 1: Player declares intent and approach**
> *Intent:* "I want to bypass the security panel without triggering any alarms."
> *Approach:* "I use the information Sera gathered about the panel model to find its known vulnerabilities, working quickly between guard patrols."
>
> ---
>
> **Step 2: GM determines if a Check is needed**
> - *Uncertainty:* Yes—the panel is sophisticated and Vance is working under pressure.
> - *Consequence:* Yes—failure could trigger alarms or alert guards.
> - *Agency:* Yes—Vance's skills and preparation can influence the outcome.
>
> All three conditions are met. The GM calls for a Check.
>
> ---
>
> **Step 3: GM sets DC using the DC ladder**
> The GM considers the circumstances:
> - The security panel is high-quality commercial grade
> - Time pressure from guard patrols
> - Unfavorable lighting conditions
>
> The GM sets **DC 18** (Hard—sophisticated system with significant obstacles).
>
> ---
>
> **Step 4: GM determines Edge or Burden from circumstances**
> The GM tallies modifiers:
> - **+1 Edge** from Sera's reconnaissance (valuable intel about the panel)
> - **+1 Edge** from Electronic Systems Proficiency (Vance knows this type of system)
> - **-1 Burden** from *Dim Light* (poor visibility for precision work)
>
> Net calculation: +1 +1 -1 = **+1 Edge total**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 5: Player rolls 4d6, adds Attribute, adds +1 if relevant Skill applies**
> With +1 Edge, Vance rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4.
>
> **Dice rolled:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
> **Dice kept (best 4):** 3, 4, 5, 6
> **Dice total:** 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = **18**
>
> Now add modifiers:
> - Attribute (AGI): +2
> - Skill (Technical Work): +1
>
> **Final result:** 18 + 2 + 1 = **21**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 6: Calculate margin (result - DC) and determine outcome tier**
> **Margin:** 21 - 18 = **+3**
>
> Consulting the outcome tier table:
> - +5 or more = Critical Success
> - **0 to +4 = Full Success** (this one)
> - -1 to -2 = Partial Success
> - -3 to -6 = Failure
> - -7 or worse = Critical Failure
>
> **Outcome Tier: Full Success**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 7: GM narrates the outcome**
> "The panel's indicator light blinks from red to green. Vance's fingers move with practiced efficiency—Sera's intel was spot-on about the firmware vulnerability. The door slides open silently. You're in, with no alarms triggered and the guards none the wiser."
>
> ---
>
> **Alternate Outcome - What if Vance rolled worse?**
>
> Suppose Vance had rolled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on his 5d6 and kept 2, 3, 4, 5 = 14.
>
> **Final result:** 14 + 2 (AGI) + 1 (Skill) = **17**
> **Margin:** 17 - 18 = **-1**
> **Outcome Tier: Partial Success**
>
> *GM Narration:* "The panel accepts your bypass, but it takes longer than expected—you hear footsteps approaching. The door opens, but now you must decide: slip inside and hope the guard passes, or abort and find cover? Either way, the 'Guard Alert' Clock ticks forward by 1 segment."

### Interpreting Outcomes

Every outcome tier should change the situation. The GM and players work together to describe what the dice mean in the fiction.

- **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more) – You achieve more than you aimed for. Extra benefits, stronger position, or accelerated progress. In combat, this often means additional Clock ticks or bonus effects.
- **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) – You get what you wanted with no significant cost. The scene moves forward cleanly. Your intent is fulfilled as stated.
- **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2) – You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect. Momentum continues, tension rises. Common costs include: resource expenditure, unwanted attention, reduced scope of success, or new obligations.
- **Failure** (margin -3 to -6) – You do not achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Threats advance, resources strain, or positions worsen. The GM should advance threat Clocks or introduce new complications.
- **Critical Failure** (margin -7 or worse, or all 1s) – Things go significantly wrong. Use sparingly for dramatic beats: broken tools, dangerous exposure, or major escalations. This is not punishment—it is an opportunity for dramatic tension.

### Worked Examples

The following examples demonstrate complete Check resolution from intent through outcome. Study these to understand how the mechanical sequence flows in actual play.

> **Example - Social Check with Partial Success**
>
> *Scene:* Mira needs to convince a merchant to sell rare components at a fair price. The merchant is greedy but not hostile.
>
> *Intent:* "I want the merchant to sell me the precision lenses at cost."
> *Approach:* "I appeal to his reputation among the guild, mentioning that fair dealing now will bring future business from my contacts."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is a PRE-based Check using a social Skill. The merchant is motivated by profit but values his reputation. DC 14 (Routine social negotiation with a neutral party).
>
> *Modifiers:* Mira has the Negotiation Skill (+1) and mentions her guild contacts, which the GM rules is good fictional positioning but not quite Edge-worthy on its own.
>
> *Roll:* Mira rolls 4d6: 2, 3, 4, 5 = 14. Adding PRE +2 and Skill +1 = 17.
> *Margin:* 17 - 14 = +3.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The merchant agrees to sell at cost, impressed by Mira's guild connections and the promise of future business. She obtains the precision lenses without complication.
>
> ---
>
> *Alternate Roll:* Suppose Mira had rolled 4d6: 1, 2, 3, 4 = 10. Adding PRE +2 and Skill +1 = 13.
> *Margin:* 13 - 14 = -1.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The merchant agrees to sell the lenses at cost, but names his price: Mira must bring him first pick of salvage from her next job. She has the components she needs, but now owes a favor that may prove inconvenient later.

> **Example - Combat Check with Strike Outcome and Clock Ticks**
>
> *Scene:* During a warehouse fight, Kira faces a hired thug. The environment is marked with *Crates* (cover) and *Dim Light*. Kira's ally Dex used a **Set Up** action last turn to flank the thug, granting Kira Edge.
>
> *Intent:* "I want to take down this thug before reinforcements arrive."
> *Approach:* "I strike at his weapon arm, trying to disarm and disable him quickly."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is an AGI-based **Strike** action. The thug is a standard combatant with a 6-segment Resolve Clock. DC 16 (Tough—the thug is trained and alert).
>
> *Modifiers:*
> - +1 Edge from Dex's flanking setup
> - *Dim Light* would normally impose Burden, but Kira has low-light training (negated)
>
> *Roll:* With +1 Edge, Kira rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Keeping 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Adding AGI +2 = 20.
> *Margin:* 20 - 16 = +4.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) = **Clear Strike**.
>
> *Mechanical Result:* A Clear Strike ticks the target's Resolve Clock by 2 segments. The thug's Resolve Clock advances from 0/6 to 2/6.
>
> *Narrative Result:* Kira's blade connects cleanly with the thug's forearm. He grunts in pain and his grip loosens on his weapon. He is hurt and shaken but still fighting. Two more solid hits and he will go down.

> **Example - Skill Check with Edge and Burden Modifiers**
>
> *Scene:* Vance attempts to pick a locked door in the basement of a noble's estate. The environment is marked with *Dim Light* (Burden) and Vance is working with borrowed tools rather than his own precision set. However, an ally spent time earlier casing the lock mechanism, providing useful information.
>
> *Intent:* "I want to open this lock without triggering any alarms."
> *Approach:* "I work carefully, applying what Sera told me about the lock's design, and take my time to avoid mistakes."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is an AGI-based Check using Technical Work Skill. The lock is high-quality. DC 18 (Hard—sophisticated lock in unfavorable conditions).
>
> *Modifiers:*
> - -1 Burden from *Dim Light* (impairs precision work)
> - -1 Burden from improvised tools (borrowed picks, not his custom set)
> - +1 Edge from Sera's reconnaissance (useful information about the mechanism)
> - Net modifier: +1 Edge + (-2 Burden) = -1 Burden total
>
> *Roll:* With -1 Burden, Vance rolls 5d6 and keeps the worst 4: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Keeping 1, 2, 4, 5 = 12. Adding AGI +3 and Technical Work +1 = 16.
> *Margin:* 16 - 18 = -2.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The lock clicks open—Vance's skill overcomes the poor conditions. However, the effort takes longer than expected, and one of his borrowed picks snaps inside the mechanism. He will need to explain the broken tool to its owner, and the damaged lock may be noticed when the household checks security in the morning. He is in, but evidence of his passage remains.

### Strike Outcomes

When you make a **Strike** action in combat, the outcome tier determines both the damage dealt and any additional effects. Strikes interact directly with target Resolve Clocks.

#### Strike Outcome Table

| Outcome Tier | Result | Resolve Clock Effect | Additional Consequences |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more) | Devastating Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 3 segments | Choose one: apply a relevant Condition (*Staggered*, *Bleeding*, *Disarmed*), gain immediate positioning for next action, or deny target their next reaction |
| **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) | Clear Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 2 segments | Clean hit with no complications; maintain your position |
| **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2) | Glancing Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 1 segment | Target may respond: GM ticks a threat Clock by 1 OR target gains minor positioning (chooses engagement distance, cover, etc.) |
| **Failure** (margin -3 to -6) | Miss | No Resolve Clock progress | GM chooses: tick a threat Clock by 1 segment OR target gains positioning advantage OR environmental complication |
| **Critical Failure** (margin -7 or worse) | Disastrous Miss | No Resolve Clock progress | GM chooses two consequences from the Failure list, OR one major consequence (weapon stuck, fall prone, ally endangered, etc.) |

> **Note**
> Threat Clocks represent dangers to the attacking character or their allies: "Reinforcements Arrive," "Escaping Target," "Collateral Damage," etc. The GM establishes relevant threat Clocks at the start of combat or introduces them as the situation develops.

#### Strike Mechanics Summary

- **Clear Strike** (Full Success): Your attack connects solidly. Tick the target's Resolve Clock by 2 segments. This is the baseline effective hit.
- **Glancing Strike** (Partial Success): You land a blow, but not cleanly. Tick the target's Resolve Clock by 1 segment. The target gains an opportunity: either a threat Clock advances, or the target improves their tactical position.
- **Miss** (Failure): Your attack fails to connect meaningfully. The target suffers no Resolve damage. Instead, the situation worsens for you: threat Clocks advance, the target repositions, or the environment becomes more dangerous.

> **Example - Strike Outcomes in Sequence**
>
> *Round 1:* Kira (Clear Strike) hits the thug for 2 Resolve ticks (now 2/6).
> *Round 2:* The thug attacks Kira. The GM rolls a Glancing Strike—Kira takes 1 Resolve tick, and the "Reinforcements Arrive" Clock ticks by 1 (the noise draws attention).
> *Round 3:* Kira attacks again but rolls a Miss. The thug takes no damage, but the GM ticks "Reinforcements Arrive" by 1 more—it is now 2/4. Kira must end this fight quickly.

### Group Checks and Assistance

Many actions involve more than one character. Rather than rolling for everyone separately every time, the GM can use:

- **Assistance**: One character leads the action, another assists. If the assistance is credible in the fiction, the leader gains Edge or a small bonus.
- **Representative Checks**: One Check stands in for a coordinated group effort. The outcome tier describes how the whole group fares.
- **Split Risks**: Two or more characters each roll, and the GM focuses on the most interesting combination of results rather than tracking every detail.

Pick the method that best fits the moment. Use single rolls when you want quick resolution. Use individual rolls when it is important that different characters face different consequences.

### Checks and Clocks

Some obstacles are too big for a single Check. Instead, the GM creates a **Clock** with several segments. Successful Checks tick the Clock forward; failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks.

Use Clocks when:

- Characters are working toward a long-term goal, such as investigating a mystery or repairing a ship.
- A danger is mounting over time, such as a collapsing tunnel, spreading fire, or advancing enemy force.
- Two or more forces are racing toward different outcomes (opposing Clocks).

> **Example - Clock and Checks**
> *Trigger:* The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.
> *Clocks:* "Evacuation Complete" (6 segments) and "Flood Waters Rise" (4 segments).
> *Rolls:* Each scene, characters make MIG, AGI, PRE, or RSN Checks based on their chosen contributions—lifting sandbags, coordinating crowds, analyzing routes. Successes advance the evacuation clock; failures or partials tick the flood clock or create new complications.
> *Outcome:* Which clock fills first determines whether the district is saved, partially saved, or overwhelmed.

### Keeping Momentum

Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt:

- Use Partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action.
- Let Failures create new problems, reveal information, or shift the situation rather than blocking all paths.
- Allow retries only when the circumstances or approach meaningfully change.

The goal is not to punish characters for rolling poorly. The goal is to discover what happens next when risk meets intent. If the table keeps that in view, Checks will feel like natural beats in the story rather than interruptions.

### Chapter Summary

Checks are the core resolution tool: declare intent and approach, assess whether a roll is needed, set DC and modifiers, roll 4d6, and interpret the outcome. **Having a relevant Skill adds +1 to your Check result**—this is a flat bonus with no levels or ranks. Edge and Burden adjust dice rather than targets. Outcome tiers—from Critical Success to Critical Failure—shape consequences with explicit margin ranges (+5 or more, 0 to +4, -1 to -2, -3 to -6, -7 or worse). Strike outcomes have specific mechanical effects: Clear Strikes tick Resolve Clocks by 2, Glancing Strikes by 1 with counterplay, and Misses advance threat Clocks or grant enemy positioning. The 4d6 system produces an average roll of 14, with each +1 modifier shifting success probability by 15-20%—use the probability tables to plan tactics and assess risk. Use the Check Procedure Summary and quick-reference tables during play to keep the action flowing.
