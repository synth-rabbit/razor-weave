## 10. Combat Basics

Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core combat actions to shape the fiction.

If you are familiar with Hit Points from other games, think of Resolve Clocks as tracking momentum and composure rather than physical damage. A filled Clock does not mean death; it means the character can no longer continue fighting on their terms. They might flee, surrender, collapse from exhaustion, or be rendered helpless—the specific outcome depends on the stakes established at the start of the fight. This distinction matters: combat in this system ends when someone is *out*, not necessarily when they are dead.

### Combat as a Scene

Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does not call for "initiative" the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know who acts in what order and how threats respond.

The table can always ask, "Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?" Use structured turns when:

- Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.
- Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.
- Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.

Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration. Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate "combat mode."

### Resolve Instead of Hit Points

The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close someone is to being taken out of a fight.

- **Resolve Clocks** track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC (Vital Player Character—a significant NPC), or enemy can absorb before they are out of the scene.
- **Conditions** such as *Bleeding*, *Exhausted*, or *Stunned* mark lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.

When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your opponent's Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse, depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.

> **Why Resolve Clocks?**
>
> If you are coming from games with hit points, Resolve Clocks may feel unfamiliar. Here is why this system uses them:
>
> **Traditional HP:** A number that decreases. You ask "how many hit points left?" Combat becomes arithmetic—subtract damage, track totals, compare numbers.
>
> **Resolve Clocks:** Fictional pressure that increases. You ask "how close is this character to being taken out?" Combat becomes story—when do they falter, become desperate, finally break?
>
> | HP System | Resolve Clock System |
> |-----------|---------------------|
> | "The orc has 15 HP left" | "The orc's Clock is half full—he's getting desperate" |
> | "I deal 8 damage" | "Full Success on Strike—tick 2 segments" |
> | "He's at 0 HP, he dies" | "Clock fills—he flees, surrenders, or falls" |
> | Outcome is always depletion to zero | Outcome fits the stakes: defeat, capture, retreat |
> | Progress is hidden in numbers | Progress is visible: everyone sees the Clock filling |
>
> This keeps attention on narrative stakes rather than arithmetic, and lets different fights end in different ways.

#### Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?

Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:

- **Fiction first** – A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at "0 HP."
- **Visible progress** – A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.
- **Flexible stakes** – Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.
- **Pacing control** – The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick, cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.

Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and story rather than pure attrition.

#### Resolve Clock Sizing Guidelines

The size of a Resolve Clock determines how long an opponent can stay in the fight. Use these guidelines when setting up combat encounters:

| Clock Size | Threat Level | Examples |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| 4-segment | Minor threat | Lone minion, minor obstacle, fragile opponent |
| 6-segment | Standard threat | Trained combatant, dangerous beast, competent rival |
| 8-segment | Major threat | VPC antagonist, elite enemy, climactic foe |

For groups of minor enemies, consider using a single shared Resolve Clock rather than tracking individuals. A gang of four thugs might share a 6-segment Clock; when it fills, the survivors flee or surrender.

#### Resolve Clock Sizing Guide

Use this table to quickly determine appropriate Resolve Clock sizes based on enemy tier. Player characters typically use 6-segment Resolve Clocks.

| Enemy Tier | Clock Size | Typical Threats | Example |
|------------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Minion | 4-segment | Easily dispatched foes who fall quickly; rarely act alone | Single guard, street thug, wild animal, automated sentry |
| Standard | 6-segment | Competent opposition who pose real danger; the baseline threat | Trained soldier, experienced mercenary, dangerous predator, skilled rival |
| Elite | 8-segment | Dangerous foes who require coordination to defeat; often have tactical abilities | Veteran warrior, pack alpha, hardened assassin, war machine |
| Boss | 8-segment + special abilities | Major threats who anchor encounters; may have multiple phases or additional mechanics | Crime lord with guards, cult leader with ritual powers, apex predator with lair advantages |

> **Note**
> Boss-tier enemies often combine their 8-segment Clock with special abilities, environmental control, or supporting minions. The Clock alone does not make a boss dangerous—their fictional positioning and narrative weight do. When a boss Clock fills, the defeat should feel earned and significant.

#### Resolve Clock Tick Rates

When your actions affect an opponent's Resolve Clock, use this table to determine how many segments to tick:

| Outcome | Resolve Clock Effect | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more) | 2-3 segments | Devastating blow; tick 3 for particularly effective attacks or exploited vulnerabilities |
| **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) | 2 segments | Solid hit; clear progress toward taking them out |
| **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2) | 1 segment | Glancing blow; you also suffer a cost or complication (counterblow, lost position, Condition) |
| **Failure** (margin -3 or worse) | 0 segments | Miss or ineffective; GM may tick a threat Clock against you or impose a Condition |

> **Example – Enemy Resolve**
> A dangerous VPC has a 6-segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of the fight in a way that fits the story.

Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.

Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what "taken out" means in this scene. Are you trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises about consequences.

### Turns and Order

Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach that fits the scene.

> **Initiative Options Quick Reference**
>
> | Mode | How It Works | Best For |
> |------|--------------|----------|
> | **Conversational** | GM asks "Who acts next?" and rotates spotlight naturally | Small skirmishes, narrative focus, simple fights |
> | **Popcorn** | After resolving your turn, you choose who goes next (ally or enemy) | Dynamic fights, unpredictable flow, keeping everyone engaged |
> | **Rolled** | Each participant rolls AGI or relevant Check; act in order from highest to lowest | Tactical set-pieces, when precise timing matters, competitive scenarios |
>
> **GM Tip: Match Initiative to Scene Tone**
> - *Tense standoffs* → Conversational (builds suspense, allows negotiation)
> - *Chaotic melees* → Popcorn (captures confusion, surprises everyone)
> - *Tactical ambushes* → Rolled (rewards preparation, clear sequence)

Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands who is up next.

> **Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order**
> A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, "We're in structured turns now," and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.

### Combat Round Procedure

When running structured combat, follow these seven steps for each character's turn. This procedure ensures clarity and keeps the action moving:

1. **Establish Turn Order** – Determine who acts next using your chosen initiative mode (conversational, popcorn, or rolled). Make it clear whose turn it is.

2. **Declare Intent and Approach** – The active character states what they want to accomplish (intent) and how they plan to do it (approach). Choose a core combat action: **Strike**, **Maneuver**, **Set Up**, or **Defend/Withdraw**.

3. **GM Sets DC and Modifiers** – The GM assesses the situation, considers relevant Tags, positioning, and opposition, then sets the DC (typically DC 12–20) and notes any Edge or Burden that applies.

4. **Resolve the Check** – Roll 4d6, add the relevant Attribute modifier, and apply Edge or Burden. Compare the result to the DC to determine the outcome tier.

5. **Apply Outcomes** – Based on the outcome tier, apply the appropriate effects:
   - Tick Resolve Clocks (see Tick Rates table)
   - Apply or remove Tags
   - Impose or clear Conditions
   - Grant or consume Edge for future actions

6. **Update the Fiction** – The GM narrates the result, describing how the scene changes. Describe the physical and emotional impact: does the opponent stagger, grow desperate, or stand firm?

7. **Move to Next Character** – Pass the spotlight to the next character in the turn order. In popcorn initiative, the current player chooses who goes next.

> **GM Guidance**
> Keep the procedure moving briskly. Steps 2–6 should take no more than a minute for routine actions. If a player hesitates on their intent, offer two or three concrete options to choose from. The goal is momentum, not deliberation.

### Combat Turn Checklist

Use this quick-reference during your turn to keep combat moving smoothly:

> **Your Turn at a Glance**
>
> | Step | What You Do |
> |------|-------------|
> | 1. Choose Action | Pick one: **Strike**, **Maneuver**, **Set Up**, or **Defend/Withdraw** |
> | 2. Declare Intent | State what you want to accomplish and how you approach it |
> | 3. GM Sets DC | GM considers Tags, position, and opposition to set DC and note Edge/Burden |
> | 4. Roll | Roll 4d6 + Attribute + Skill (+1 if applicable Skill applies) |
> | 5. Apply Outcome | Compare to DC, then apply effects to target's Resolve Clock or scene Tags |
>
> **Outcome Effects Summary:**
> - **Critical (+5+):** 2-3 Clock segments, possible bonus effect
> - **Full (0 to +4):** 2 Clock segments
> - **Partial (-1 to -2):** 1 Clock segment, plus a cost or complication
> - **Failure (-3-):** No progress; GM may tick a Clock against you

This checklist covers the essentials. When in doubt, describe what your character does in the fiction first, then work out the mechanics with your GM.

---

### Your Turn: Structure and Options

On your turn, you usually:

- Describe what you do in the fiction.
- Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).
- Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.

If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters, it often fits into the same turn.

Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.

### Core Combat Actions

Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:

- **Strike** – Directly attack a target.
- **Maneuver** – Change position, create openings, or control space.
- **Set Up** – Create Edge or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.
- **Defend / Withdraw** – Protect yourself or break contact to recover.

#### Action Types Quick Reference

Use this table for at-a-glance guidance on combat actions:

| Action | Primary Attribute | Typical DC | Full Success Effect | Partial Success Effect |
|--------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Strike** | MIG or AGI | DC 14–16 | Tick 2 segments on target's Resolve Clock | Tick 1 segment; suffer counterblow or cost |
| **Maneuver** | AGI or MIG | DC 14–16 | Apply Tag (*Prone*, *Exposed*) or remove enemy advantage | Create opening but become *Exposed* yourself |
| **Set Up** | PRE or RSN | DC 12–14 | Grant Edge to self or ally; create helpful Tag | Grant Edge but suffer positioning cost |
| **Defend** | AGI or MIG | DC 14 | Avoid incoming harm completely | Reduce harm but take lesser Condition |
| **Withdraw** | AGI | DC 12–14 | Break contact safely; reach cover or exit | Escape but leave ally exposed or drop item |

> **Note**
> The Attribute and DC shown are typical starting points. The GM adjusts based on your specific approach, the opposition, and environmental Tags. A clever approach that uses the environment might lower the DC; attacking a well-defended position might raise it.

#### Strike

Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot, hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on your opponent's awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.

On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become *Exposed*, suffer a counterblow, or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your opponent a positional or narrative advantage.

Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you commit to repeated Strikes.

#### Maneuver

Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside a weapon.

Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can create *Prone*, strip *Solid Cover*, or apply a useful Tag such as *Exposed* that allies can exploit on later turns.

Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a rope bridge. In sci-fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single Strike.

#### Set Up

Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you grant Edge or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the opening but at some cost.

Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Edge you create.

As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher-tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better positions, cover, and Edge, Strikes become dramatically more effective.

#### Defend / Withdraw

Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover, blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition or yielding ground.

This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or surviving to fight another day.

Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it, the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from "win here" to "escape, regroup, or change the stakes." Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.

### Positioning and Environment

Tags play a major role in combat. *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*, *Fragile Cover*, *Slick*, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or change what is possible at all. Manage position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.

> **Example – Using the Battlefield**
> In a rooftop fight marked as *Elevated* with scattered *Fragile Cover*, one character uses Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting Edge on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats *Elevated* as granting Edge on ranged attacks from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.

---

### Reading the Battlefield

Tags are not just descriptive flavor—they are tactical tools. Understanding how to read and exploit environmental Tags separates competent fighters from exceptional ones. Before you act, scan the scene for Tags that might help or hinder you.

#### Common Combat Tags and Their Effects

| Tag | Tactical Effect | How to Exploit It |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|
| *Elevated* | Grants Edge on ranged attacks from high ground; imposes Burden on melee attackers below | Archers and snipers should claim high ground early; melee fighters should Maneuver to pull enemies down or find stairs |
| *Cover* (Solid or Fragile) | Provides Burden to attackers targeting you; *Fragile Cover* may be destroyed on Partial or Failed defense | Stay behind cover when possible; use Maneuvers to destroy enemy cover or flush them out |
| *Dim Light* | Imposes Burden on actions requiring clear sight; grants Edge on Stealth | Extinguish lights to aid escape; create light sources to reveal hidden enemies |
| *Cramped* | Limits movement options; may impose Burden on large weapons or sweeping attacks | Favor short weapons and grappling; use the space to prevent enemies from flanking |
| *Slick* / *Hazardous* | Imposes Burden on movement-based Checks; may cause Conditions on failure | Use Maneuvers to push enemies into hazardous terrain; be cautious when charging |
| *Exposed* | Grants Edge to attackers targeting someone with this Tag | Create *Exposed* through Maneuvers; capitalize on it with coordinated Strikes |

#### Reading Tags in Practice

When combat begins, ask yourself:

1. **What Tags favor me?** Can I reach high ground, use cover, or exploit dim light for stealth?
2. **What Tags threaten me?** Am I exposed? Is the terrain hazardous? Will my approach trigger Burden?
3. **What Tags can I change?** Can I create cover, destroy enemy advantages, or add new Tags through Maneuvers?

> **Example – Tactical Tag Use**
> The party enters a warehouse fight with these Tags: *Dim Light*, *Stacked Crates* (cover), *Elevated Catwalks*.
>
> - **Kira (melee fighter)** uses the *Dim Light* to close distance with Stealth, then Maneuvers to pull an enemy off the *Elevated Catwalk*.
> - **Varn (support)** climbs to the catwalk, gaining *Elevated* for his crossbow shots—Edge on ranged attacks.
> - **Rella (scout)** uses Set Up from behind *Stacked Crates*, calling out enemy positions to grant Edge to allies.
>
> By reading the battlefield, each character found Tags that amplified their strengths.

#### Changing the Battlefield

You are not limited to the Tags present at the start of a fight. Maneuvers can create new Tags or remove existing ones:

- **Create Cover:** Flip a table, collapse a shelf, or erect a barrier.
- **Remove Cover:** Destroy *Fragile Cover* with a Strike, set it ablaze, or pull it down.
- **Create Hazards:** Spill oil and ignite it (*Hazardous*), cut a steam pipe (*Scalding*), or shatter a window (*Glass Shards*).
- **Control Light:** Extinguish torches (*Dim Light*), smash lanterns, or activate emergency lighting.
- **Alter Terrain:** Create *Slick* surfaces with water or oil, clear debris to remove *Cramped*, or collapse supports to block paths.

The battlefield is not static. Fighters who actively shape the environment gain significant advantages over those who simply react to it.

---

### Conditions in Combat

Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being *Stunned* by a concussive blast, *Bleeding* after a severe hit, or *Suppressed* by incoming fire. These Conditions modify subsequent Checks and shape choices.

Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be cleared. For example, *Stunned* might end after you lose your next action, while *Exhausted* may persist until you rest between scenes.

Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both *Bleeding* and *Exhausted* is under pressure each round and rolling with Burden on many actions. Scenes like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.

### Worked Combat Examples

These examples show complete combat sequences with Resolve Clock progression, demonstrating how the system flows in practice.

---

#### Example 1: The Tense Duel

**Setup:** Kira, a skilled duelist (AGI 2, Brawling Skill), faces Varro, a rival enforcer. Both have 4-segment Resolve Clocks. The scene is a rain-slicked courtyard (*Slick* Tag). Stakes: first to be taken out loses the dispute.

**Round 1 – Varro Strikes First**
- Varro lunges with his blade. AGI Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 17).
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 2 segments (now 2/4). She staggers back.
- *Fiction:* The blade catches her arm—a shallow cut but a solid hit.

**Round 2 – Kira Sets Up**
- Kira circles, watching his footwork, looking for a pattern. Set Up action.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 16 vs. DC 14).
- *Effect:* Kira gains Edge on her next Strike. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* She notices he overextends on his lunges—she can exploit that.

**Round 3 – Kira Strikes**
- Using her Edge, Kira feints low and strikes high. AGI Check with +1 Edge.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 21 with 5d6 keep 4).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/4). He reels.
- *Fiction:* Her blade opens a gash on his shoulder. Blood mixes with rain.

**Round 4 – Varro Maneuvers Desperately**
- Desperate, Varro kicks at the slick ground, spraying water toward her eyes.
- *Result:* Partial Success (rolled 13 vs. DC 14, margin -1).
- *Effect:* Kira gains *Dazed* (Burden next round), but Varro is now *Exposed*.
- *Fiction:* Water stings her eyes, but his wild kick leaves him off-balance.

**Round 5 – Kira Finishes It**
- Despite being *Dazed* (Burden), Kira presses. He's *Exposed* (Edge cancels Burden).
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 15).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock fills (4/4). He's taken out.
- *Fiction:* She drives him back against the fountain. His blade clatters away. He yields.

**Outcome:** Kira wins with 2/4 on her Clock. Varro is defeated but alive—he'll remember this.

---

#### Example 2: The Group Fight

**Setup:** Three PCs (Kira, Varn, Rella) face four bandits in a warehouse. Tags: *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, *Dim Light*. Bandits share a 6-segment group Resolve Clock. Each PC has a 4-segment Clock. Stakes: subdue or drive off the bandits.

**Round 1 – Bandits Attack**
- Two bandits rush Kira. GM rolls a group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Partial Success.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 1 segment (1/4). She takes a glancing blow.
- Two bandits circle toward Varn and Rella but don't reach them yet.

**Round 2 – Kira Maneuvers**
- Kira shoves crates to create better cover for allies. MIG Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Allies now have *Solid Cover* against ranged attacks. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* Heavy crates screech across the floor, forming a barricade.

**Round 3 – Varn Sets Up**
- Varn calls out bandit positions and weak points. PRE-based Set Up vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Kira and Rella both gain Edge on their next actions.
- *Fiction:* "The big one favors his left leg—go for it!"

**Round 4 – Rella Strikes (with Edge)**
- Rella throws her lantern at the bandits' feet. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 16.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 18 with 5d6).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 2 segments (2/6). The area gains *Hazardous* Tag.
- *Fiction:* Oil splashes and ignites. Two bandits scramble back, singed.

**Round 5 – Bandits Retaliate**
- Remaining bandits attack Rella (nearest threat). Group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Failure (rolled 11).
- *Effect:* No Clock advance on Rella. She ducks behind cover.
- *Fiction:* Clubs swing wide as Rella drops flat.

**Round 6 – Kira Strikes (with Edge from Round 3)**
- Kira charges the big bandit, targeting his weak leg. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 20).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 3 segments (5/6). The big one goes down.
- *Fiction:* Her blade sweeps his leg. He crashes into crates and doesn't get up.

**Round 7 – Varn Negotiates**
- With their leader down, Varn calls for surrender. PRE Check vs. DC 12 (lowered—they're losing).
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock fills (6/6). They surrender.
- *Fiction:* "It's over! Drop your weapons or burn with the warehouse!"

**Outcome:** Bandits subdued. Kira has 1/4 on her Clock. No one else was seriously hurt. The *Hazardous* fire must be dealt with, but the fight is won.

#### Example 3: Cross-Genre Combat Encounter

The following example demonstrates the same combat structure across three different genre settings, showing how Tags, actions, and Clocks adapt to any fiction while the mechanics remain consistent.

---

**The Scenario:** A group of three characters must stop a dangerous opponent before they can complete a critical objective. The fight takes place in a confined space with environmental hazards.

**Fantasy Version: The Ritual Chamber**

**Scene Setup:**
- *Location:* A stone ritual chamber beneath an ancient temple
- *Tags:* *Dim Light* (torches flicker), *Arcane Circles* (magical hazard zones), *Crumbling Pillars* (destructible cover)
- *Combatants:* Three adventurers vs. a cult sorcerer (Elite, 8-segment Resolve Clock)
- *Stakes:* Stop the ritual before it completes; the sorcerer has a "Ritual Completion" Clock (4-segment) that advances each round

**Initiative:** Rolled AGI. Order: Sera (fighter), Sorcerer, Tomm (rogue), Wren (cleric).

**Round 1**

*Sera (Fighter) – Strike*
- Intent: Close distance and disrupt the sorcerer with a sword blow.
- Approach: Charges across the chamber, avoiding the *Arcane Circles*.
- Check: MIG-based Strike vs. DC 16 (sorcerer is alert, magical wards shimmer).
- Roll: 4d6 = 4, 4, 5, 6 = 19. MIG +2 = 21. Margin +5.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Sorcerer's Clock ticks 3 segments (3/8).
- Fiction: Sera's blade cuts through a ward, staggering the sorcerer mid-incantation. Sparks of disrupted magic scatter across the floor.

*Sorcerer – Maneuver + Ritual*
- The sorcerer gestures, and the *Arcane Circles* flare with energy.
- Check: RSN-based Maneuver vs. DC 14.
- Roll: Success. Sera gains the *Burning* Condition (Burden on physical actions until cleared).
- The "Ritual Completion" Clock ticks 1 segment (1/4).
- Fiction: Violet flames lick at Sera's legs. The chanting continues.

*Tomm (Rogue) – Set Up*
- Intent: Identify weak points in the sorcerer's defenses.
- Approach: Circles behind a *Crumbling Pillar*, watching the pattern of wards.
- Check: RSN-based Set Up vs. DC 14.
- Roll: 4d6 = 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. RSN +1 = 19. Margin +5.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Tomm gains Edge on his next action AND identifies a gap in the wards (creates *Exposed Flank* Tag on sorcerer).
- Fiction: "There! When he gestures left, his right side drops the ward for a heartbeat!"

*Wren (Cleric) – Maneuver*
- Intent: Suppress the ritual's power by disrupting the magical circles.
- Approach: Channels divine energy into the nearest circle.
- Check: PRE-based Maneuver vs. DC 16.
- Roll: 4d6 = 2, 3, 5, 6 = 16. PRE +2 = 18. Margin +2.
- Outcome: **Full Success**. One *Arcane Circle* is neutralized; area becomes safe to cross.
- Fiction: Holy light floods the circle, and the violet flames gutter and die. The sorcerer hisses in frustration.

**Round 2**

*Sera (Fighter) – Defend*
- Intent: Buy time while *Burning* by getting to cover.
- Approach: Rolls behind a pillar and smothers the flames.
- Check: AGI-based Defend vs. DC 14 (with Burden from *Burning*).
- Roll: 5d6 keep worst 4 = 2, 3, 3, 4 = 12. AGI +1 = 13. Margin -1.
- Outcome: **Partial Success**. *Burning* clears, but Sera is now *Prone* behind the pillar.
- Fiction: She rolls frantically, extinguishing the flames, but ends up flat on her back.

*Sorcerer – Strike*
- Targets Wren, who disrupted the circles.
- Check: RSN-based Strike vs. DC 14.
- Roll: Success. Wren's Clock ticks 2 segments (2/6).
- The "Ritual Completion" Clock ticks 1 segment (2/4).
- Fiction: A bolt of shadow slams into Wren's shoulder. She stumbles but keeps her feet.

*Tomm (Rogue) – Strike (with Edge and Exposed Flank)*
- Intent: Exploit the opening he identified.
- Approach: Darts from cover, striking during the ward gap.
- Check: AGI-based Strike vs. DC 14 with +1 Edge (from Set Up) and attacking *Exposed Flank*.
- Roll: 5d6 keep best 4 = 4, 5, 5, 6 = 20. AGI +2 = 22. Margin +8.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Sorcerer's Clock ticks 3 segments (6/8).
- Fiction: Tomm's dagger finds flesh. The sorcerer screams, concentration shattered. The ritual falters.

*Wren (Cleric) – Set Up*
- Intent: Bolster allies for the final push.
- Approach: Invokes a blessing of protection.
- Check: PRE-based Set Up vs. DC 12.
- Roll: 4d6 = 3, 4, 5, 5 = 17. PRE +2 = 19. Margin +7.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. All allies gain Edge on their next action.
- Fiction: Golden light settles over the group. "Finish this!"

**Round 3**

*Sera (Fighter) – Strike (with Edge)*
- Intent: End the fight before the ritual can resume.
- Approach: Rises from *Prone* and delivers a decisive blow.
- Note: Rising from *Prone* costs her Edge advantage but does not prevent the Strike.
- Check: MIG-based Strike vs. DC 14 (Edge consumed by rising).
- Roll: 4d6 = 4, 5, 5, 6 = 20. MIG +2 = 22. Margin +8.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Sorcerer's Clock fills (8/8). Taken out.
- Fiction: Sera's blade crashes through the last ward and into the sorcerer's staff, shattering it. He collapses, the ritual energy dissipating into harmless motes of light.

**Resolution:** The sorcerer is defeated with his Ritual Clock at 2/4—the party stopped him with rounds to spare. Wren has 2/6 on her Clock, Sera cleared her Condition but took a risk. The chamber is safe, but the cult will not forget this defeat.

**Sci-Fi Version: The Station Corridor**

**Scene Setup:**
- *Location:* A damaged corridor on an orbital station, emergency lighting only
- *Tags:* *Zero-G Pockets* (gravity fluctuates), *Sparking Conduits* (electrical hazard), *Vacuum Breach Nearby* (time pressure)
- *Combatants:* Three crew members vs. a rogue security drone (Elite, 8-segment Resolve Clock)
- *Stakes:* Disable the drone before it reaches the reactor; "Reactor Breach" Clock (6-segment) advances each round the drone is not stopped

*Marcus (Medic) – Maneuver*
- Intent: Use the *Zero-G Pockets* to flank the drone.
- Approach: Pushes off the wall, floating through a gravity null zone.
- Check: AGI-based Maneuver vs. DC 16 (zero-G is tricky).
- Roll: 4d6 = 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. AGI +1 = 19. Margin +3.
- Outcome: **Full Success**. Marcus gains *Flanking Position* Tag; removes drone's cover advantage.
- Fiction: Marcus floats silently through the null zone, coming up behind the drone's damaged side.

*Zara (Pilot) – Strike (with Edge from Exposed Sensor Array)*
- Intent: Disable the drone's movement systems.
- Approach: Fires her sidearm at the drone's leg actuators.
- Check: AGI-based Strike vs. DC 14 with +1 Edge.
- Roll: 5d6 keep best 4 = 4, 5, 5, 6 = 20. AGI +2 = 22. Margin +8.

*Drone – Disrupted*
- No action this round due to *Systems Disrupted*.
- "Reactor Breach" Clock ticks 1 segment (2/6).
- Fiction: The drone twitches, rebooting. Emergency systems kick in, but it is vulnerable.

*Marcus (Medic) – Strike (with Flanking Position)*
- Intent: Jam his medical laser into the exposed sensor array.
- Check: AGI-based Strike vs. DC 14 with +1 Edge (flanking).
- Roll: 5d6 keep best 4 = 4, 5, 6, 6 = 21. AGI +1 = 22. Margin +8.

**Cross-Genre Summary**

Notice how each version used the same mechanical structure:
- Scene setup with environmental Tags that created tactical opportunities
- Initiative establishing turn order
- Three to four rounds with varied action types (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw)
- Clock advancement tracking both enemy Resolve and external pressure (ritual, evidence, reactor)
- Combat resolution when the primary threat's Clock filled

The Tags changed (*Arcane Circles* vs. *Zero-G Pockets* vs. *Slick Floor*), the fiction changed (swords vs. fists vs. lasers), but the procedure remained consistent. This is the core strength of the system: learn it once, play it anywhere.

### Putting It Together

A typical combat turn might look like this:

1. The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.
1. You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.
1. The GM sets DC, notes any Edge/Burden, and clarifies stakes.
1. You roll **4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.
1. The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.

Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when Edge and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a series of disconnected attacks.

The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs, VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre-flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.

### Chapter Summary

Combat uses the same Check system as other scenes, focused through Resolve Clocks, core combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw), and environmental Tags. Use the **Combat Turn Checklist** for quick reference during play. Follow the seven-step Combat Round Procedure for structured fights. Use the **Resolve Clock Tick Rates** table to determine outcome effects. Reference the **Action Types Quick Reference** for at-a-glance guidance on your options. Consult **Reading the Battlefield** to exploit environmental Tags tactically. Choose an initiative mode that fits the scene tone. The worked examples show how Clocks, Tags, and actions combine into dynamic fights with meaningful stakes.
