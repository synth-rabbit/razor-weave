## 9. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive. They connect description to mechanics so that rain, fear, injuries, crowds, and looming deadlines all matter at the table. This chapter explains what each of these tools is for, how to use them, and how they interact with Checks.

### When to Use What

Before diving into the details, use this quick-reference table to understand what each system does and when to reach for it:

> **When to Use What - Quick Reference**
>
> | System | What It Tracks | Who Controls It | Duration | Example |
> |--------|----------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
> | Tags | Scene elements and circumstances | GM sets, players can change | Until fiction changes | *Dim Light*, *Elevated* |
> | Conditions | Character states from events | Applied by outcomes | Until cleared by action/time | *Exhausted*, *Frightened* |
> | Clocks | Progress toward goals or threats | Ticked by successes/failures | Until filled | "Escape the Building" 6-segment |

### The Three Systems in Action

To see how Tags, Conditions, and Clocks work together without overlapping, consider this scenario:

> **Example - Three Systems, One Scene**
>
> A character sneaks through a guarded warehouse at night.
>
> **Tags describe the environment:**
> The scene has the Tags *Dim Light* and *Cluttered*. These belong to the space itself. *Dim Light* grants Edge on Stealth but imposes Burden on spotting details. *Cluttered* provides opportunities for cover but makes quick movement difficult. If someone turns on the lights, the *Dim Light* Tag disappears—Tags change when the fiction changes.
>
> **Conditions describe the character:**
> After failing a Stealth Check, the character gains the Condition *Spotted*. This follows them—even if they move to a different room, guards are now actively searching for them. The Condition imposes Burden on further Stealth attempts until they break line of sight and hide successfully.
>
> **Clocks track momentum:**
> Meanwhile, an "Alert Level" 4-segment Clock sits on the table. Each failed Check or loud action ticks it forward. When it fills, reinforcements arrive and the exits lock down. The Clock does not care about location or character state—it tracks the overall situation's trajectory toward a specific outcome.
>
> **Each system serves a different purpose:** Tags shape what is possible in this space. Conditions reflect what has happened to this character. Clocks measure how close the situation is to changing dramatically.

### Tags vs. Conditions

**Tags** describe **the environment or situation**. They belong to places, scenes, objects, or circumstances: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, *Crowded*, *Fragile Cover*. Tags affect what you can do in a space and how you do it.

**Conditions** describe **your character's state**. They follow you from one location to the next until cleared: *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*, *Frightened*, *Restrained*. Conditions affect your actions wherever you go.

Tags and Conditions are the shared vocabulary the table uses to talk about advantages, risks, and lingering consequences. They are not extra subsystems to memorize. They are the names you give to things you are already describing.

### What Tags Do

A Tag is a short descriptor applied to a scene, location, object, or situation. It becomes a flag: "remember this when resolving actions here." Tags typically:

- Grant Edge or Burden on certain Checks.
- Raise or lower DCs for specific actions.
- Change position or effect (how risky an action feels or how big its impact is).

You do not tag every detail. A room is just a room until its darkness, instability, crowd, or sacred significance matters to what characters are attempting. Tag the things that will shape decisions.

### How Tags Affect Checks

Tags translate fictional circumstances into mechanical modifiers. When a Tag is relevant to a Check, it typically grants Edge or imposes Burden based on whether the circumstance helps or hinders the action.

**The Basic Rule:** If a Tag makes an action easier, it grants Edge. If a Tag makes an action harder, it imposes Burden. Some Tags do both depending on what you are attempting.

> **Common Tag Effects**
>
> | Tag | Grants Edge On | Imposes Burden On |
> |-----|----------------|-------------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Stealth, hiding, ambush | Sight-based Checks, ranged attacks at distance, reading or fine work |
> | *Slick* | Sliding into cover, pushing opponents | Movement, balance, standing quickly, pursuit |
> | *Elevated* | Ranged attacks from above, surveying area | Being targeted from below (opponents get Edge), climbing down under pressure |
> | *Cramped* | Fighting with short weapons, grappling | Wide swings, large weapons, group coordination |
> | *Chaotic* | Misdirection, blending in, escaping notice | Coordination, communication, finding specific people |
> | *Formal* | Proper etiquette, official requests | Informal approaches, casual conversation, blending in without credentials |

When multiple Tags apply, combine their effects. If one Tag grants Edge and another imposes Burden on the same Check, they cancel out. If two Tags both grant Edge, you gain +2 Edge (capped at the normal maximum). The GM adjudicates edge cases based on the fiction.

> **Note**
> Not every Tag affects every Check. A *Dim Light* Tag has no bearing on a Persuasion attempt unless visibility is specifically relevant to the conversation. Apply Tags when they logically matter.

### Common Tags Quick Reference

> **Common Tags Quick Reference**
>
> Use this table during play to quickly identify how Tags affect actions.
>
> **Environmental Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Burden on vision-based actions; Edge on Stealth | Dusk, candlelight, fog, shuttered windows |
> | *Darkness* | Severe Burden or impossible for sight-based tasks | Night without light sources, underground |
> | *Slick* | Burden on movement and balance Checks | Rain, ice, oil spills, wet stone |
> | *Cramped* | Burden on wide swings and large movements | Narrow passages, crowded rooms, tunnels |
> | *Elevated* | Edge on ranged attacks from above; risk of falling | Rooftops, balconies, cliff edges |
> | *Solid Cover* | Edge on defense; blocks line of sight | Stone walls, heavy furniture, vehicles |
> | *Fragile Cover* | Limited protection; can be destroyed | Wooden crates, thin walls, market stalls |
> | *Unstable* | Risk of collapse; Burden on careful actions | Old bridges, crumbling floors, scaffolding |
>
> **Situational Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Outnumbered* | Burden on defense; enemies may gang up | Multiple foes vs. fewer defenders |
> | *Flanked* | Burden on defense against flanking attacks | Enemies on opposite sides |
> | *Surprised* | Cannot act in first round; Burden on initial reactions | Ambush, failed awareness Check |
> | *Exposed* | Burden on defense; easy target | No cover, caught in open ground |
> | *Hazardous* | Risk of harm from environment; may tick threat Clocks | Fire, toxic fumes, electrical danger |
> | *Surveillance* | Actions may be observed and reported | Guards, cameras, informants nearby |
>
> **Atmospheric Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Tense* | Social missteps escalate quickly; Burden on calming actions | Standoffs, negotiations, high stakes |
> | *Chaotic* | Burden on coordination; opportunities for misdirection | Riots, battles, emergencies |
> | *Formal* | Burden on informal approaches; Edge for proper etiquette | Courts, ceremonies, official meetings |
> | *Suspicious* | Burden on trust-building; increased scrutiny | After crimes, with strangers, in enemy territory |

### Most-Used Tags Cheat Sheet

When you need an instant lookup during play, use this condensed table of the most common Tags:

> **Most-Used Tags Cheat Sheet**
>
> | Tag | Mechanical Effect | Example Use |
> |-----|-------------------|-------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Burden on sight-based Checks, Edge on Stealth | Night scenes, shadowy interiors |
> | *Elevated* | Edge on ranged attacks from above | Rooftops, balconies, high ground |
> | *Cover* | Burden to attacks against you | Behind walls, furniture, vehicles |
> | *Cramped* | Burden on large movements and wide swings | Tunnels, ducts, narrow alleys |
> | *Slippery* | Burden on movement Checks | Rain-slick streets, ice, oil spills |

You can invent new Tags that fit your setting. The important part is agreeing at the table what a Tag does in practice: which actions it helps, which it hinders, and how it shapes consequences.

> **Example - Tags in a Warehouse Fight**
> The GM describes a warehouse full of stacked crates, narrow aisles, and oil-spotted floors. They assign the Tags *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, and *Slick*.
> *Cramped* makes wide swings and large weapons awkward. *Fragile Cover* means wooden crates can be shredded by fire, potentially stripping cover away. *Slick* imposes Burden on fast movement or acrobatic maneuvers. Every decision in this scene now has texture.

### What Conditions Do

Conditions represent persistent states that modify what a character can safely attempt. They are the mechanical mark left by consequences. When something important happens to you—injury, fear, strain, affliction—it often becomes a Condition.

Conditions typically:

- Impose Burden on certain actions.
- Limit available options (cannot run, cannot act this turn, cannot speak clearly).
- Threaten further harm if ignored (ongoing damage, ticking Clocks).

### Condition Quick Reference

Use this table to quickly determine how common Conditions affect play:

> **Condition Quick Reference**
>
> | Condition | Mechanical Effect | Clearing Method | Example Source |
> |-----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
> | *Exhausted* | Burden on all physically demanding Checks (climbing, fighting, running) | Rest for at least one scene; receive meaningful aid or restorative treatment | Prolonged exertion, sleep deprivation, sustained hardship |
> | *Bleeding* | Tick a personal 4-segment "Bleed Out" Clock each scene if untreated; when filled, you fall unconscious | Stabilization Check (DC 14), medical treatment, or appropriate Proficiency | Serious wounds, failed combat Checks, environmental hazards |
> | *Frightened* | Burden on all Checks while the source of fear is visible or immediately threatening | Rally (successful PRE Check), escape the source, or defeat/neutralize the threat | Supernatural terror, overwhelming force, failed morale Check |
> | *Disarmed* | Cannot use your primary weapon; Burden on attacks until you recover it or draw another | Retrieve the weapon (action), draw a backup weapon, or disarm your opponent | Enemy maneuver, failed grapple, successful disarm action against you |
> | *Prone* | Burden on melee attacks and defense; Edge for enemies attacking you in melee; cannot move normally | Stand up (costs movement or minor action); an ally can help you up | Knocked down, tripped, diving for cover, failed balance Check |

Additional Conditions appear in the Extended Tags and Conditions Reference chapter. When you create custom Conditions, ensure each one has a clear mechanical effect and an achievable clearing method.

### Common Conditions Cheat Sheet

For fast reference during play, use this condensed table of the most frequent Conditions:

> **Common Conditions Cheat Sheet**
>
> | Condition | Effect | Cleared By |
> |-----------|--------|------------|
> | *Exhausted* | Burden on physical actions | Rest |
> | *Frightened* | Burden on actions toward source | Remove threat or calm |
> | *Bleeding* | Tick personal harm Clock each scene | Medical aid |
> | *Stunned* | Lose next action | Automatic next turn |

### Examples of Common Conditions

A full alphabetical list appears in the Glossary. Here are a few you will see often:

- **Exhausted** - Burden on demanding physical actions until you rest or receive meaningful aid.
- **Bleeding** - Time pressure from an untreated wound. If not stabilized, it may tick a personal Clock or escalate to worse states.
- **Restrained** - You are held or pinned. You cannot move freely and must break free or be helped.
- **Dazed** - Disoriented; Burden on perception and reaction until you recover.
- **Frightened** - Burden on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when you rally, escape, or defeat the source.

> **Example - From Event to Condition**
> A character fails a Check while crossing a compromised catwalk. Rather than simple damage, the GM describes how they slam into the railing and twist their knee. They gain the Condition *Exhausted* or *Weakened*, representing reduced stamina. Future physical actions are harder until they rest or receive treatment.

### Using Tags and Conditions with Checks

Tags and Conditions do not require new rules. They plug directly into the Check system:

- Tags often grant Edge or Burden on Checks that interact with them.
- Conditions usually impose Burden or limit which approaches are reasonable.
- Some Tags shift DCs or change position and effect instead of modifying dice directly.

When you are about to roll, quickly review which Tags and Conditions are relevant. Ask: "Does this make the action easier, harder, or riskier?" Then adjust Edge/Burden, DC, or consequences accordingly.

> **Example - Tag and Condition Interaction**
> In a horror-tinged mystery, a character stalks through a foggy graveyard at night. The scene has Tags *Dim Light* and *Obscured*. The character is also *Frightened* from a previous encounter.
> When they attempt to sneak past patrolling figures, *Dim Light* and *Obscured* might grant Edge on Stealth, but *Frightened* could impose Burden on actions taken while the threat is visible. The GM weighs these factors, cancels opposing modifiers as needed, and describes how the character's shaky nerves show up in the fiction.

### Introducing and Clearing Conditions

Conditions should follow naturally from events. A failed Check in a hazardous area might cause *Bleeding* or *Poisoned*. Exposure to overwhelming sights might cause *Frightened*. Pushing beyond safe limits might cause *Exhausted*.

When you introduce a Condition, state:

- What it represents in the fiction.
- How it affects actions (which Checks it modifies and how).
- How it can be cleared (time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock).

Minor Conditions should clear quickly once addressed. Major Conditions may persist across several scenes or form the basis for character-driven goals.

### What Clocks Are

Clocks are segmented trackers that answer "how close are we?" for goals and threats. A Clock is a circle or track divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments. As actions succeed, time passes, or events occur, segments fill. When the Clock completes, something happens.

> **What a Clock Looks Like**
>
> ```
>        ___________
>       /     |     \
>      /   2  |  3   \
>     |_______|_______|
>     |\\\\\\\|       |
>     | \\\1\\|   4   |
>      \_\\\\\_______/
>       \_____\_____/
>          6     5
> ```
>
> *A 6-segment Clock with 2 segments filled. Three more successful actions will complete it.*
>
> In practice, you can draw a Clock as a simple circle divided into pie slices. Fill segments by shading them in or marking them with an X. Many groups use index cards, dry-erase boards, or digital tools to track Clocks visibly at the table.

Use Clocks to represent:

- **Long-term goals** - Research projects, faction plans, character endeavors.
- **Mounting threats** - Approaching storms, advancing enemies, spreading plagues.
- **Ticking dangers** - Rituals completing, bombs counting down, collapsing structures.
- **Faction projects** - Off-screen activities of NPCs and organizations.

### Clock Advancement Guide

Understanding when and how Clocks advance is crucial for pacing and tension. Use these guidelines:

> **Clock Advancement by Check Outcome**
>
> This table provides default tick rates. Specific actions, abilities, or circumstances may override these defaults at GM discretion.
>
> | Check Outcome | Progress Clock | Threat/Opposing Clock | Notes |
> |---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
> | **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments | No advance | Exceptional progress; choose 3 segments for breakthrough moments |
> | **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments | No advance | Standard progress; use 2 segments for well-executed plans |
> | **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment | May tick 1 segment | Progress with complication; the complication often manifests as threat Clock advancement |
> | **Failure** | No progress | Tick 1-2 segments | Setback; threat advances while goal stalls |
> | **Critical Failure** | No progress | Tick 2-3 segments | Serious setback; may also introduce new Conditions or Tags |

> **GM Guidance - Clock Advancement Defaults**
> The table above establishes a mechanical baseline. Use it as your starting point, then adjust based on the fiction. A character with a relevant Proficiency might tick an extra segment on success. An action that is particularly risky or loud might tick threat Clocks even on success. The defaults ensure consistent pacing; your judgment ensures the fiction makes sense.

### Clock Advancement Cheat Sheet

For quick reference during play, use this at-a-glance summary:

> **Clock Advancement Cheat Sheet**
>
> | Outcome | Progress Clock | Threat Clock |
> |---------|----------------|--------------|
> | **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments | No advance |
> | **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments | No advance |
> | **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment + complication | May tick 1 segment |
> | **Failure** | No progress | Tick 1-2 segments (or tick threat Clock) |

#### Multi-Clock Guidance

When multiple Clocks are active, use this decision process:

1. **Identify the primary Clock.** Ask: "Which Clock does this action most directly affect?" Advance that Clock based on the outcome.

2. **Consider secondary effects.** If the action is loud, risky, or draws attention, ask: "Does this also affect a threat Clock?" If yes, tick it.

3. **Handle ambiguous actions.** When an action could affect multiple Clocks:
   - If the player's intent was clear, honor that intent
   - If uncertain, advance the Clock most connected to their stated approach
   - For truly split actions, consider ticking both at reduced rates

> **Decision Flowchart: Which Clock Advances?**
>
> ```
> Action Taken
>     |
>     v
> Does the action directly target a specific Clock?
>     |
>     +-- YES -> Advance that Clock based on outcome
>     |         |
>     |         v
>     |    Was the action loud, risky, or attention-drawing?
>     |         |
>     |         +-- YES -> Also tick the most relevant threat Clock
>     |         +-- NO  -> Done
>     |
>     +-- NO -> Which Clock is most affected by this approach?
>              |
>              v
>         Advance that Clock; consider threat Clocks if failure occurred
> ```

### Advancing Clocks

Clocks advance in several ways:

- **Success-based** - Successful Checks tick a project Clock forward.
- **Time-based** - Segments fill as scenes pass or as in-world time moves.
- **Event-based** - Specific narrative events advance background or faction Clocks.

Partial successes often advance a Clock and introduce a complication. Exceptional successes may jump a Clock by more than one segment. Failures might leave a Clock unchanged while pushing forward a related threat Clock.

### Opposing Clocks: A Worked Example

> **Example - Investigation vs. Cover-Up**
>
> The group is investigating a corrupt official while the official works to destroy evidence.
>
> **Clocks:**
> - "Expose the Official" - 6-segment Clock (investigation progress)
> - "Cover-Up Complete" - 4-segment Clock (enemy countermeasures)
>
> **Round 1:** The investigator searches the official's office.
> - *Check:* RSN-based Investigation against DC 16 (Tough—the office has been partially cleaned)
> - *Result:* Full Success (margin +2)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 2 segments. Found a ledger with suspicious entries.
> - *Threat Clock:* No advance—the search was quiet and unnoticed.
>
> **Round 2:** The investigator questions a nervous clerk.
> - *Check:* PRE-based Persuasion against DC 14 (Routine)
> - *Result:* Partial Success (margin -1)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 1 segment. Clerk reveals a name but is visibly frightened.
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 1 segment. The clerk will warn the official.
>
> **Round 3:** The official learns of the investigation and begins destroying documents.
> - *Event-based:* GM ticks "Cover-Up" 1 segment automatically (faction action).
> - "Cover-Up" now at 2/4 segments.
>
> **Round 4:** The investigator tries to intercept the document destruction.
> - *Check:* AGI-based Stealth against DC 16 (Tough—guards are alert)
> - *Result:* Failure (margin -4)
> - *Effect:* No progress on "Expose."
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 2 segments. Guards catch the investigator; documents are burned.
> - "Cover-Up" fills to 4/4—evidence destroyed!
>
> **Outcome:** The Cover-Up Clock filled first. The official escapes immediate exposure, but the investigator has partial evidence (3/6 on "Expose"). The story continues with new stakes: can they find other witnesses before the official silences them?

### Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

These tools are most powerful when used together:

- Tags set the stage: terrain, lighting, crowds, magical effects.
- Conditions show how previous events cling to characters and shape their options.
- Clocks track momentum toward outcomes that matter over time.

A single scene might involve a *Hazardous* Tag, characters who are *Exhausted*, and a "Structural Collapse" Clock. Every roll becomes a meaningful choice about risk, effort, and timing.

> **GM Guidance - Start Small**
> You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene. Start with one or two Tags that matter, a few Conditions that arise naturally, and a single important Clock. Add more only when they clarify the fiction rather than clutter it. When in doubt, ask: "Does this tool make the situation clearer and more interesting?" If yes, use it.

### Chapter Summary

Tags describe environments and situations; Conditions describe character states; Clocks track progress toward outcomes. The "When to Use What" table at the start of this chapter helps you quickly identify which system applies to a given situation. Use the Common Tags tables and the Most-Used Tags Cheat Sheet for quick reference during play. The Condition Quick Reference and Common Conditions Cheat Sheet provide mechanical effects and clearing methods for the most frequent Conditions. Apply the Clock Advancement by Check Outcome table and the Clock Advancement Cheat Sheet to maintain consistent pacing—these defaults give you a mechanical baseline before applying GM judgment. When multiple Clocks compete, let the fiction guide which advances. These tools work together to make the world feel responsive and stakes feel real.
