## 5. Ways to Play the Game

This game supports multiple styles of play. Some groups meet weekly around a table. Others play online
        in short sessions. Some prefer a single player experience. Others use a shared world without a
        designated Game Master. The system is flexible and does not assume one standard format. The rules in
        later chapters work for all modes of play.

This chapter gives an overview of each play style. It also points to the sections of the book that
        support them. You do not need to choose one style forever. Many groups switch between modes depending on
        who is available or what kind of story they want to tell.

### Play Mode Selection Guide

| Mode | Best For | Players Needed | Session Length |
|------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Group + GM | Traditional play, campaign arcs | 3-6 + GM | 2-4 hours |
| Duet | Personal stories, flexible scheduling | 1 + GM | 1-2 hours |
| GMless | Collaborative worldbuilding | 2-5 | 2-3 hours |
| Solo | Personal exploration, between sessions | 1 | Any |
| Asynchronous | Busy schedules, remote play | 2+ | Ongoing |

### Group Play With a GM

A group gathers with one person acting as Game Master. The GM presents the world, plays its **characters**,
        and describes the consequences of player actions. The **players control their own characters** and make
        decisions that drive the story forward.

> **Session Zero Checklist**
> When starting a new group, use your first session to establish these foundations:
> - Discuss safety tools and boundaries
> - Choose play mode
> - Establish setting and tone
> - Create characters together
> - Set session schedule expectations

### Duet Play

Duet play involves one player and one GM. It feels more intimate and often focuses on personal stories
        or character driven arcs. Scenes can shift quickly. The pacing is flexible.

### GMless Cooperative Play

In GMless play, the group shares narrative responsibility. No single person controls the world. Instead,
        the table uses procedures that rotate authority and help distribute scene framing, consequences, and
        world building. The game still uses the core resolution system, but each player takes turns providing
        challenges or interpreting outcomes.

> **GMless Play Procedure**
> When you play without a GM, use these steps to keep authority flowing smoothly:
> 1. Each scene, rotate who frames the situation. The framing player describes the location, the immediate tension, and any relevant Tags.
> 2. When a character faces opposition, another player voices the obstacle. This player describes what stands in the way and how it resists.
> 3. For uncertain outcomes, the player to your left sets the DC based on the fiction. They assess the difficulty using the standard DC ladder.
> 4. Use Clocks to track group goals and external pressure. A shared 6-segment Clock can represent your investigation progress while a 4-segment threat Clock builds tension.
> 5. When the fiction demands consequences, the group collaborates on what makes sense. Discuss briefly, then the framing player makes the final call.

### Solo Play

Solo play is designed for a single player. You control one or more characters and use
        structured tools to emulate the world. These tools include prompts, oracles, and scene framing
        procedures. Solo play keeps the core mechanics intact.

> **Solo Play Tools**
> For solo play, you need a way to introduce uncertainty when no GM is present. Consider these options:
> 1. **Simple Oracle:** Roll 1d6 when asking yes/no questions about the world. On 1-2: No, and something complicates matters. On 3-4: No. On 5: Yes. On 6: Yes, and something improves the situation.
> 2. **Card Prompts:** Draw from a deck of playing cards for random prompts. Assign meanings to suits (Hearts for social encounters, Spades for threats, Diamonds for discoveries, Clubs for obstacles) and use the card value to gauge intensity.
> 3. **Published Supplements:** Use solo play supplements designed for fiction-first games. These often include oracle tables, scene generators, and procedures for pacing your sessions.

### Asynchronous and Play by Post

Asynchronous play occurs through messages, email, shared documents, or online platforms. Players take
        turns responding when they have time. Because asynchronous play lacks immediate conversation, clarity
        is essential. Players describe intent and approach carefully. The GM presents outcomes with enough
        detail to move the story forward between posts.

### One Shot Sessions

A one shot is a complete adventure played in a single session. These sessions help introduce new
        players to the system and work well for conventions or special events. One shots focus on clear stakes
        and strong pacing.

### Campaign Play

A campaign is a longer story told over multiple sessions. Campaigns grow through character development,
        evolving threats, and unfolding consequences. The GM builds on player actions and uses tools like
        Clocks and Tags to maintain continuity.

### Hybrid Styles

Many tables blend modes. Some groups use solo play between sessions to develop character arcs. Others
        rotate GMless scenes inside a GM led campaign. Some begin with a one shot and transition into a long
        form campaign. The system supports these transitions without additional rules.

### Choosing the Right Mode

There is no single correct way to play. Each mode offers a different experience. Choose group play for
        shared storytelling and dynamic character interaction. Choose duet play for intimate stories. Choose
        GMless for collaborative world building. Choose solo play for personal exploration. Choose asynchronous
        play for flexible schedules. Choose one shots for quick adventures. Choose campaigns for deep, evolving
        narratives.

### Chapter Summary

This chapter described the supported modes of play. The system works whether you have one player or six,
        whether you have a GM or distribute authority, and whether you play in person or through messages. The
        next chapter introduces the character framework that supports all of these play styles.
