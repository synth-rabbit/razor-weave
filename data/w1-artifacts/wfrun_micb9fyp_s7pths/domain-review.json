The Success Probability by DC table now matches the 4d6 Roll Distribution table with values derived from actual cumulative probabilities. All other mechanics remain consistent: Skills add +1, Edge/Burden caps at +/-2, DC ladder is correct, Clock sizes are consistent, outcome margins align, and tactical advice is mechanically sound. One minor issue remains (term imprecision in Chapter 10) but is non-blocking. Ready for validation."
