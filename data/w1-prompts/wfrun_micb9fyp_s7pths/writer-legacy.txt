## 10. Combat Basics

Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core combat actions to shape the fiction.

### Combat as a Scene

Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does not call for "initiative" the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know who acts in what order and how threats respond.

The table can always ask, "Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?" Use structured turns when:

- Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.
- Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.
- Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.

Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration. Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate "combat mode."

### Resolve Instead of Hit Points

The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close someone is to being taken out of a fight.

- **Resolve Clocks** track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC (Vital Player Character—a significant NPC), or enemy can absorb before they are out of the scene.
- **Conditions** such as *Bleeding*, *Exhausted*, or *Stunned* mark lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.

When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your opponent's Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse, depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.

> **Why Resolve Clocks?**
>
> If you are coming from games with hit points, Resolve Clocks may feel unfamiliar. Here is why this system uses them:
>
> **Traditional HP:** A number that decreases. You ask "how many hit points left?" Combat becomes arithmetic—subtract damage, track totals, compare numbers.
>
> **Resolve Clocks:** Fictional pressure that increases. You ask "how close is this character to being taken out?" Combat becomes story—when do they falter, become desperate, finally break?
>
> | HP System | Resolve Clock System |
> |-----------|---------------------|
> | "The orc has 15 HP left" | "The orc's Clock is half full—he's getting desperate" |
> | "I deal 8 damage" | "Full Success on Strike—tick 2 segments" |
> | "He's at 0 HP, he dies" | "Clock fills—he flees, surrenders, or falls" |
> | Outcome is always depletion to zero | Outcome fits the stakes: defeat, capture, retreat |
> | Progress is hidden in numbers | Progress is visible: everyone sees the Clock filling |
>
> This keeps attention on narrative stakes rather than arithmetic, and lets different fights end in different ways.

#### Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?

Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:

- **Fiction first** – A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at "0 HP."
- **Visible progress** – A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.
- **Flexible stakes** – Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.
- **Pacing control** – The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick, cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.

Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and story rather than pure attrition.

#### Resolve Clock Sizing Guidelines

The size of a Resolve Clock determines how long an opponent can stay in the fight. Use these guidelines when setting up combat encounters:

| Clock Size | Threat Level | Examples |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| 4-segment | Minor threat | Lone minion, minor obstacle, fragile opponent |
| 6-segment | Standard threat | Trained combatant, dangerous beast, competent rival |
| 8-segment | Major threat | VPC antagonist, elite enemy, climactic foe |

For groups of minor enemies, consider using a single shared Resolve Clock rather than tracking individuals. A gang of four thugs might share a 6-segment Clock; when it fills, the survivors flee or surrender.

#### Resolve Clock Tick Rates

When your actions affect an opponent's Resolve Clock, use this table to determine how many segments to tick:

| Outcome | Ticks | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Critical Success** | 2-3 | Devastating blow; tick 3 for particularly effective attacks |
| **Full Success** | 2 | Solid hit; clear progress toward taking them out |
| **Partial Success** | 1 | Glancing blow; you also suffer a cost or complication |
| **Failure** | 0 | Miss or ineffective; GM may tick a threat Clock against you |

> **Example – Enemy Resolve**
> A dangerous VPC has a 6-segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of the fight in a way that fits the story.

Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.

Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what "taken out" means in this scene. Are you trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises about consequences.

### Turns and Order

Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach that fits the scene.

> **Initiative Options Quick Reference**
>
> | Mode | How It Works | Best For |
> |------|--------------|----------|
> | **Conversational** | GM asks "Who acts next?" and rotates spotlight naturally | Small skirmishes, narrative focus, simple fights |
> | **Popcorn** | After resolving your turn, you choose who goes next (ally or enemy) | Dynamic fights, unpredictable flow, keeping everyone engaged |
> | **Rolled** | Each participant rolls AGI or relevant Check; act in order from highest to lowest | Tactical set-pieces, when precise timing matters, competitive scenarios |
>
> **GM Tip: Match Initiative to Scene Tone**
> - *Tense standoffs* → Conversational (builds suspense, allows negotiation)
> - *Chaotic melees* → Popcorn (captures confusion, surprises everyone)
> - *Tactical ambushes* → Rolled (rewards preparation, clear sequence)

Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands who is up next.

> **Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order**
> A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, "We're in structured turns now," and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.

### Combat Round Procedure

When running structured combat, follow these seven steps for each character's turn. This procedure ensures clarity and keeps the action moving:

1. **Establish Turn Order** – Determine who acts next using your chosen initiative mode (conversational, popcorn, or rolled). Make it clear whose turn it is.

2. **Declare Intent and Approach** – The active character states what they want to accomplish (intent) and how they plan to do it (approach). Choose a core combat action: **Strike**, **Maneuver**, **Set Up**, or **Defend/Withdraw**.

3. **GM Sets DC and Modifiers** – The GM assesses the situation, considers relevant Tags, positioning, and opposition, then sets the DC (typically DC 12–20) and notes any Edge or Burden that applies.

4. **Resolve the Check** – Roll 4d6, add the relevant Attribute modifier, and apply Edge or Burden. Compare the result to the DC to determine the outcome tier.

5. **Apply Outcomes** – Based on the outcome tier, apply the appropriate effects:
   - Tick Resolve Clocks (see Tick Rates table)
   - Apply or remove Tags
   - Impose or clear Conditions
   - Grant or consume Edge for future actions

6. **Update the Fiction** – The GM narrates the result, describing how the scene changes. Describe the physical and emotional impact: does the opponent stagger, grow desperate, or stand firm?

7. **Move to Next Character** – Pass the spotlight to the next character in the turn order. In popcorn initiative, the current player chooses who goes next.

> **GM Guidance**
> Keep the procedure moving briskly. Steps 2–6 should take no more than a minute for routine actions. If a player hesitates on their intent, offer two or three concrete options to choose from. The goal is momentum, not deliberation.

### Your Turn: Structure and Options

On your turn, you usually:

- Describe what you do in the fiction.
- Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).
- Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.

If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters, it often fits into the same turn.

Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.

### Core Combat Actions

Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:

- **Strike** – Directly attack a target.
- **Maneuver** – Change position, create openings, or control space.
- **Set Up** – Create Edge or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.
- **Defend / Withdraw** – Protect yourself or break contact to recover.

#### Action Types Quick Reference

Use this table for at-a-glance guidance on combat actions:

| Action | Primary Attribute | Typical DC | Full Success Effect | Partial Success Effect |
|--------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Strike** | MIG or AGI | DC 14–16 | Tick 2 segments on target's Resolve Clock | Tick 1 segment; suffer counterblow or cost |
| **Maneuver** | AGI or MIG | DC 14–16 | Apply Tag (*Prone*, *Exposed*) or remove enemy advantage | Create opening but become *Exposed* yourself |
| **Set Up** | PRE or RSN | DC 12–14 | Grant Edge to self or ally; create helpful Tag | Grant Edge but suffer positioning cost |
| **Defend** | AGI or MIG | DC 14 | Avoid incoming harm completely | Reduce harm but take lesser Condition |
| **Withdraw** | AGI | DC 12–14 | Break contact safely; reach cover or exit | Escape but leave ally exposed or drop item |

> **Note**
> The Attribute and DC shown are typical starting points. The GM adjusts based on your specific approach, the opposition, and environmental Tags. A clever approach that uses the environment might lower the DC; attacking a well-defended position might raise it.

#### Strike

Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot, hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on your opponent's awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.

On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become *Exposed*, suffer a counterblow, or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your opponent a positional or narrative advantage.

Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you commit to repeated Strikes.

#### Maneuver

Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside a weapon.

Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can create *Prone*, strip *Solid Cover*, or apply a useful Tag such as *Exposed* that allies can exploit on later turns.

Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a rope bridge. In sci-fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single Strike.

#### Set Up

Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you grant Edge or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the opening but at some cost.

Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Edge you create.

As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher-tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better positions, cover, and Edge, Strikes become dramatically more effective.

#### Defend / Withdraw

Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover, blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition or yielding ground.

This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or surviving to fight another day.

Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it, the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from "win here" to "escape, regroup, or change the stakes." Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.

### Positioning and Environment

Tags play a major role in combat. *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*, *Fragile Cover*, *Slick*, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or change what is possible at all. Manage position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.

> **Example – Using the Battlefield**
> In a rooftop fight marked as *Elevated* with scattered *Fragile Cover*, one character uses Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting Edge on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats *Elevated* as granting Edge on ranged attacks from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.

### Conditions in Combat

Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being *Stunned* by a concussive blast, *Bleeding* after a severe hit, or *Suppressed* by incoming fire. These Conditions modify subsequent Checks and shape choices.

Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be cleared. For example, *Stunned* might end after you lose your next action, while *Exhausted* may persist until you rest between scenes.

Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both *Bleeding* and *Exhausted* is under pressure each round and rolling with Burden on many actions. Scenes like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.

### Worked Combat Examples

These examples show complete combat sequences with Resolve Clock progression, demonstrating how the system flows in practice.

---

#### Example 1: The Tense Duel

**Setup:** Kira, a skilled duelist (AGI 2, Brawling Skill), faces Varro, a rival enforcer. Both have 4-segment Resolve Clocks. The scene is a rain-slicked courtyard (*Slick* Tag). Stakes: first to be taken out loses the dispute.

**Round 1 – Varro Strikes First**
- Varro lunges with his blade. AGI Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 17).
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 2 segments (now 2/4). She staggers back.
- *Fiction:* The blade catches her arm—a shallow cut but a solid hit.

**Round 2 – Kira Sets Up**
- Kira circles, watching his footwork, looking for a pattern. Set Up action.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 16 vs. DC 14).
- *Effect:* Kira gains Edge on her next Strike. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* She notices he overextends on his lunges—she can exploit that.

**Round 3 – Kira Strikes**
- Using her Edge, Kira feints low and strikes high. AGI Check with +1 Edge.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 21 with 5d6 keep 4).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/4). He reels.
- *Fiction:* Her blade opens a gash on his shoulder. Blood mixes with rain.

**Round 4 – Varro Maneuvers Desperately**
- Desperate, Varro kicks at the slick ground, spraying water toward her eyes.
- *Result:* Partial Success (rolled 13 vs. DC 14, margin -1).
- *Effect:* Kira gains *Dazed* (Burden next round), but Varro is now *Exposed*.
- *Fiction:* Water stings her eyes, but his wild kick leaves him off-balance.

**Round 5 – Kira Finishes It**
- Despite being *Dazed* (Burden), Kira presses. He's *Exposed* (Edge cancels Burden).
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 15).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock fills (4/4). He's taken out.
- *Fiction:* She drives him back against the fountain. His blade clatters away. He yields.

**Outcome:** Kira wins with 2/4 on her Clock. Varro is defeated but alive—he'll remember this.

---

#### Example 2: The Group Fight

**Setup:** Three PCs (Kira, Varn, Rella) face four bandits in a warehouse. Tags: *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, *Dim Light*. Bandits share a 6-segment group Resolve Clock. Each PC has a 4-segment Clock. Stakes: subdue or drive off the bandits.

**Round 1 – Bandits Attack**
- Two bandits rush Kira. GM rolls a group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Partial Success.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 1 segment (1/4). She takes a glancing blow.
- Two bandits circle toward Varn and Rella but don't reach them yet.

**Round 2 – Kira Maneuvers**
- Kira shoves crates to create better cover for allies. MIG Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Allies now have *Solid Cover* against ranged attacks. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* Heavy crates screech across the floor, forming a barricade.

**Round 3 – Varn Sets Up**
- Varn calls out bandit positions and weak points. PRE-based Set Up vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Kira and Rella both gain Edge on their next actions.
- *Fiction:* "The big one favors his left leg—go for it!"

**Round 4 – Rella Strikes (with Edge)**
- Rella throws her lantern at the bandits' feet. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 16.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 18 with 5d6).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 2 segments (2/6). The area gains *Hazardous* Tag.
- *Fiction:* Oil splashes and ignites. Two bandits scramble back, singed.

**Round 5 – Bandits Retaliate**
- Remaining bandits attack Rella (nearest threat). Group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Failure (rolled 11).
- *Effect:* No Clock advance on Rella. She ducks behind cover.
- *Fiction:* Clubs swing wide as Rella drops flat.

**Round 6 – Kira Strikes (with Edge from Round 3)**
- Kira charges the big bandit, targeting his weak leg. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 20).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 3 segments (5/6). The big one goes down.
- *Fiction:* Her blade sweeps his leg. He crashes into crates and doesn't get up.

**Round 7 – Varn Negotiates**
- With their leader down, Varn calls for surrender. PRE Check vs. DC 12 (lowered—they're losing).
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock fills (6/6). They surrender.
- *Fiction:* "It's over! Drop your weapons or burn with the warehouse!"

**Outcome:** Bandits subdued. Kira has 1/4 on her Clock. No one else was seriously hurt. The *Hazardous* fire must be dealt with, but the fight is won.

### Putting It Together

A typical combat turn might look like this:

1. The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.
1. You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.
1. The GM sets DC, notes any Edge/Burden, and clarifies stakes.
1. You roll **4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.
1. The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.

Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when Edge and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a series of disconnected attacks.

The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs, VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre-flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.

### Chapter Summary

Combat uses the same Check system as other scenes, focused through Resolve Clocks, core combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw), and environmental Tags. Follow the seven-step Combat Round Procedure for structured fights. Use the Resolve Clock Tick Rates table to determine outcome effects. Reference the Action Types Quick Reference for at-a-glance guidance on your options. Choose an initiative mode that fits the scene tone. The worked examples show how Clocks, Tags, and actions combine into dynamic fights with meaningful stakes.

## 6. Character Creation

Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule before you start. This chapter guides you step by step with all the information you need to complete each stage.

> **Quick-Start: 10-Minute Character**
>
> Need a character fast? Use this streamlined path for one-shots or time-pressed sessions:
>
> 1. **Concept in one sentence:** "A [role/background] who [defining trait or goal]."
> 2. **Attributes:** Use the standard array: 2 in your primary, 1 in two others, 0 in one.
> 3. **Skills:** Pick 3 from the Suggested Skills list below.
> 4. **Proficiencies:** Pick 2 from the Suggested Proficiencies list below.
> 5. **Gear:** Choose clothing, a backpack, and 2-3 items that fit your concept.
>
> You now have a playable character. Fill in name, background, and goals as you play. Return to the full chapter later to add depth.

### Learning by Example

Some players prefer to see a full character before reading detailed steps. If you want to follow a character build from start to finish, you can skip ahead to the Worked Examples section later in this chapter and return to each step as needed.

---

### The Nine-Step Creation Checklist

Character Creation follows nine steps. Each step is self-contained with all the guidance you need to complete it. Work through them in order, checking off each as you finish.

---

#### Step 1: Choose a Concept

**Goal:** Define who your character is in one or two sentences.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Write a short phrase that captures your character's role, background, and defining trait
- [ ] Ensure the concept suggests what scenes you want to be in
- [ ] Verify the concept fits the campaign tone (discuss with your GM if unsure)

**Guidance:**

A concept is the short answer to the question: who is this person? It does not depend on mechanics or require a long backstory. Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for discovery.

| Weak Concept | Strong Concept | Why It Works |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| "Fighter" | "Retired scout with a guilty conscience" | Suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world |
| "Smart person" | "Former telegraph engineer searching for meaning in strange patterns" | Implies profession, habits, and motivation |
| "Healer" | "Field medic who refuses to let anyone die alone" | Shows values, experience, and emotional stakes |

**Questions to help define your concept:**
- What did your character do before the story begins?
- What makes them different from others in a similar role?
- What drives them to take risks?

> **Example**
> A player chooses the concept "former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns." This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours, delicate tools, and unanswered questions.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to describe your character in a single sentence that excites you.

---

#### Step 2: Define Core Identity Elements

**Goal:** Add personal details that make your character feel real.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Choose a name and pronouns
- [ ] Note their origin or home environment
- [ ] Describe their everyday role before the story begins
- [ ] List one or two notable habits or mannerisms
- [ ] Describe how others perceive them at first meeting
- [ ] Identify one or two key experiences that shaped them

**Guidance:**

Identity elements help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at once. Focus on details that connect to your concept.

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Name and pronouns | How others address them | Rella (she/her) |
| Origin | Where they learned to see the world | Canyon relay settlement |
| Former role | What shaped their skills | Telegraph maintenance technician |
| Habits | Behavioral shortcuts for roleplay | Thinks before speaking, keeps detailed notes |
| First impressions | How NPCs initially react | Quiet but competent, overlooked in crowds |
| Formative experiences | Emotional depth and backstory hooks | Years of isolated work, one unexplained message |

You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character.

> **Example**
> The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to describe your character walking into a room and how people react to them.

---

#### Step 3: Assign Attributes

**Goal:** Distribute your character's four core capabilities.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the four Attributes and what each represents
- [ ] Assign the standard array: one at 2, two at 1, one at 0
- [ ] Verify your choices match your concept
- [ ] Note which Attribute is your weakness and consider story opportunities

**Guidance:**

Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character approaches challenges when there is no time to prepare.

| Attribute | Abbreviation | What It Represents |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Might** | MIG | Physical strength, force, raw endurance, carrying capacity |
| **Agility** | AGI | Balance, coordination, stealth, quick reaction, fine motor control |
| **Presence** | PRE | Social force, confidence, emotional expression, leadership, performance |
| **Reason** | RSN | Logic, analysis, memory, structured thinking, technical understanding |

**Standard Starting Array:**
- One Attribute at **2** (your primary strength)
- Two Attributes at **1** (competent areas)
- One Attribute at **0** (your weakness)

No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability with room to grow.

> **Attribute Priorities by Archetype**
>
> Use these common builds as starting points. Adjust based on your specific concept.
>
> ---
>
> **Physical Archetype (MIG Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | MIG | 2 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | RSN | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Warriors, laborers, athletes, enforcers, survivalists
>
> *Secondary options:* AGI for mobile fighters, PRE for intimidating leaders
>
> *Example concepts:* Retired mercenary seeking redemption, dock worker who breaks up fights, traveling blacksmith with a past
>
> ---
>
> **Agile Archetype (AGI Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | AGI | 2 |
> | RSN | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Scouts, thieves, acrobats, sharpshooters, pilots, surgeons
>
> *Secondary options:* RSN for careful planners, PRE for flashy performers
>
> *Example concepts:* Rooftop courier who sees everything, circus performer turned spy, ship's navigator with steady hands
>
> ---
>
> **Social Archetype (PRE Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | PRE | 2 |
> | RSN | 1 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Diplomats, con artists, leaders, performers, investigators, negotiators
>
> *Secondary options:* RSN for manipulative schemers, AGI for charming rogues
>
> *Example concepts:* Ex-courier who knows everyone's secrets, traveling actor gathering intelligence, disgraced noble rebuilding reputation
>
> ---
>
> **Analytical Archetype (RSN Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | RSN | 2 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Scholars, engineers, doctors, detectives, strategists, researchers
>
> *Secondary options:* AGI for careful craftspeople, PRE for lecturers and teachers
>
> *Example concepts:* Telegraph engineer decoding strange patterns, field archaeologist piecing together lost history, medical examiner who speaks for the dead

> **Example**
> Rella is analytical and steady. Her player chooses Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0. This emphasizes her careful thinking, modest coordination, quiet presence, and relative physical weakness.

**When you finish this step:** Your Attribute spread should reflect what your character is good at and what challenges them.

---

#### Step 4: Choose Skills

**Goal:** Select 3-4 learned abilities your character can rely on under pressure.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the Suggested Skills table below
- [ ] Select 3-4 Skills that fit your concept and background
- [ ] Consider creating custom Skills with GM approval if needed
- [ ] Ensure Skills support the kinds of scenes you want to experience

**Guidance:**

Skills are action-based competencies. They describe what your character has done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. When you make a Check, a Skill often shapes your approach.

Skills answer the question: what have you practiced enough to apply under stress?

| Category | Example Skills |
|----------|----------------|
| **Physical** | Athletics, Acrobatics, Climbing, Swimming, Endurance, Brawling |
| **Social** | Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Empathy, Negotiation |
| **Mental** | Investigation, Observation, Analysis, Research, Memory, Deduction |
| **Technical** | Technical Work, Crafting, Machinery, First Aid, Lockpicking, Piloting |
| **Stealth/Survival** | Stealth, Survival, Tracking, Navigation, Foraging |

**Skill Scope Guidelines:**

| Too Broad | Too Narrow | Just Right |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| "Good at everything physical" | "Tying sailor knots" | Athletics |
| "Social expert" | "Lying to guards" | Deception |
| "Technical genius" | "Fixing one brand of telegraph" | Technical Work |

**Custom Skills:** You may create Skills that do not appear on the list. Work with your GM to ensure custom Skills are grounded in the setting, clear in purpose, and neither too broad nor too narrow.

> **Example**
> Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels.

**When you finish this step:** You should have 3-4 Skills that describe what your character does well.

---

#### Step 5: Choose Proficiencies

**Goal:** Select 2-3 areas of specialized knowledge or tool familiarity.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the Suggested Proficiencies table below
- [ ] Select 2-3 Proficiencies that grow from your concept and background
- [ ] Discuss scope with your GM to ensure clarity
- [ ] Consider how Proficiencies change what your character knows automatically

**Guidance:**

Proficiencies represent narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines your character understands deeply. Proficiencies often do not require a roll. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is obvious, or how serious a risk feels.

Proficiencies answer the question: what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly?

| Category | Example Proficiencies |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Tools** | Precision Tools, Medical Instruments, Lockpicks, Climbing Gear, Navigation Equipment |
| **Knowledge** | Local History, Legal Procedures, Arcane Lore, Engineering Principles, Natural Sciences |
| **Social Contexts** | Court Etiquette, Criminal Underworld, Academic Circles, Military Protocol |
| **Environments** | Urban Navigation, Wilderness Survival, Underground Exploration, Maritime Operations |
| **Vehicles/Craft** | Small Watercraft, Ground Vehicles, Aircraft, Mounted Animals |

**How Proficiencies Work:**

Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they provide fictional authority:

| Situation | Without Proficiency | With Proficiency |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Identifying a mechanical fault | Requires a Check (DC 16) | Automatic recognition of common issues |
| Repairing delicate equipment | Check with higher stakes | Check with reduced consequences |
| Understanding technical documents | May not attempt | Can attempt with normal difficulty |
| Noticing environmental hazards | GM describes obviously | Character spots subtle signs |

> **Example**
> Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.

**When you finish this step:** You should have 2-3 Proficiencies that represent your character's specialized expertise.

---

#### Step 6: Determine Starting Gear

**Goal:** Select equipment that fits your background and supports your character's capabilities.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Record the basic gear package (all characters receive this)
- [ ] Choose up to three concept-driven items
- [ ] Select one weapon or dangerous tool if appropriate to the campaign
- [ ] Consider one custom item with GM approval if desired

**Guidance:**

Gear provides fictional authority, not numerical bonuses. It represents what your character already knows how to use and what situations they are prepared for.

**Basic Gear Package (all characters):**
- Clothing suited to their environment
- A backpack or satchel
- Basic travel supplies
- A personal item that holds meaning

**Concept-Driven Items (choose up to 3):**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Technical Tools** | Toolkit, precision instruments, repair kit, measuring devices |
| **Recording/Reference** | Field journal, reference notes, analysis cards, maps |
| **Navigation/Survival** | Compass, signal mirror, reliable lantern, rope and spikes |
| **Medical/Care** | Medical pouch, first aid supplies, herbal remedies |
| **Social/Performance** | Musical instrument, fine clothing, forged papers, contact list |
| **Combat (if appropriate)** | Pocket knife, baton, bow with arrows, simple sidearm |

**Gear as Fictional Authority:**

| If You Have the Right Gear | The GM May... |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Tools for the job | Lower the DC of related Checks |
| Equipment that fits the situation | Remove uncertainty for routine tasks |
| Specialized items | Provide access to approaches others cannot attempt |

| If You Lack Appropriate Gear | The GM May... |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| No tools available | Increase DC by one tier (e.g., DC 14 to DC 16) |
| Improvised equipment | Introduce complications on partial success |
| Wrong tools entirely | Require creative fictional justification |

> **Example**
> Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work.

**When you finish this step:** You should have a gear list that supports your character's role and feels personal.

---

#### Step 7: Establish Background and Relationships

**Goal:** Define where your character comes from and who matters to them.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Write 2-3 sentences about where you grew up and what shaped you
- [ ] Note what kind of work or role you had before the story begins
- [ ] Name at least one meaningful relationship (mentor, rival, family, friend, or enemy)
- [ ] Leave space for new relationships to emerge in play

**Guidance:**

Background provides context for your character's abilities and perspectives. Relationships give the GM material for scenes, challenges, and future story arcs.

**Background Questions:**
- Where did you grow up?
- What pressures shaped your early life?
- What was your everyday role before the story began?
- Why did you leave that life (or why are you still in it)?

**Relationship Types:**

| Type | Story Potential |
|------|-----------------|
| **Mentor** | Source of wisdom, possible debt or expectation |
| **Rival** | Competition, tension, grudging respect |
| **Family** | Obligations, love, complicated history |
| **Friend** | Support, shared history, someone to protect |
| **Enemy** | Danger, unfinished business, source of conflict |
| **Colleague** | Professional respect, shared knowledge, potential ally |

You do not need to define every relationship up front. Name one or two that feel important now. Add others as they emerge in play.

> **Example**
> Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. She names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing. Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods.

**When you finish this step:** You should have a sense of your character's past and at least one named NPC who matters to them.

---

#### Step 8: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads

**Goal:** Establish what motivates your character and what unresolved elements create story potential.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Define at least one short-term goal (achievable within a few sessions)
- [ ] Define at least one long-term goal (campaign-spanning aspiration)
- [ ] Identify a core drive (deeper motivation or fear)
- [ ] Note one or two personal threads (unresolved questions or tensions)

**Guidance:**

Goals and drives explain why your character keeps moving. Personal threads give the GM material to weave into future scenes.

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Short-term goal** | Concrete, achievable objective | "Decode the anomalous pattern I intercepted" |
| **Long-term goal** | Major aspiration that shapes the campaign | "Understand where the strange messages originate" |
| **Drive** | Underlying motivation or fear | "Avoid causing harm through my work" |
| **Personal thread** | Unresolved question or tension | "The mysterious origin of the pattern—who sent it?" |

**Goal Strength Check:**

| Strong Goal | Weak Goal |
|-------------|-----------|
| Specific and measurable | Vague or abstract |
| Connected to your concept | Disconnected from character |
| Creates story opportunities | Ends story or removes tension |
| Involves other characters | Achievable alone without conflict |

> **Example**
> Rella has a goal to decode an anomalous pattern she once intercepted and a drive to avoid causing harm through her work. A personal thread involves the mysterious origin of the pattern and who might have sent it.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to explain what your character wants and why they are willing to take risks to get it.

---

#### Step 9: Final Review and Campaign Fit

**Goal:** Ensure your character works as a cohesive whole and fits the group.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review all previous steps for internal consistency
- [ ] Verify concept, identity, mechanics, and story elements align
- [ ] Discuss with GM and other players how your character connects to the group
- [ ] Adjust details to create natural connections and complementary capabilities
- [ ] Confirm your character is ready for play

**Guidance:**

A complete character should feel like a coherent person. All the elements—concept, identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, and goals—should support each other.

**Internal Consistency Check:**

| Question | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| Does the concept match the mechanics? | High RSN for analytical characters, high MIG for physical ones |
| Do Skills reflect the background? | A former soldier should have combat or survival Skills |
| Does gear fit the profession? | Technical characters carry tools; social characters carry props |
| Do goals create story momentum? | Goals should lead to action, not avoid it |

**Group Integration Questions:**
- Why would your character travel or work with this group?
- What shared history or complementary goals connect you?
- What tensions exist that create interesting roleplay?
- What gaps in group capability does your character fill?

**When you finish this step:** Your character sheet is complete and you are ready to play.

### Worked Examples

This section presents two complete character builds with annotated decision-making at each step. These examples show different archetypes and explain the reasoning behind each choice.

---

#### Worked Example 1: Kira Valdros — Combat-Focused Character (MIG/AGI)

**Final Concept:** Former military scout turned bounty hunter who uses precision and overwhelming force.

---

**Step 1: Choosing the Concept**

*The player wants a combat-effective character who can hold their own in dangerous situations. They consider several options:*

| Option Considered | Rejected Because | Selected Because |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| "Fighter" | Too generic—no personality or history | — |
| "Retired soldier" | Common trope, needs more specificity | — |
| "Military scout turned bounty hunter" | — | Suggests combat training, tracking skills, and motivation to take dangerous jobs |

*Decision: "Former military scout turned bounty hunter" provides clear combat capability (military training), useful non-combat skills (scouting, tracking), and built-in story hooks (why did they leave the military? what do they hunt?)*

**Final Concept:** Former military scout turned bounty hunter who uses precision and overwhelming force.

---

**Step 2: Defining Identity Elements**

*The player builds on the concept to create specific details:*

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Name** | Kira Valdros (she/her) | Strong name that sounds capable; pronouns established |
| **Origin** | Border fortress settlement | Military backgrounds often come from frontier areas; suggests tough upbringing |
| **Former Role** | Scout and forward observer for garrison force | Explains both combat and reconnaissance skills |
| **Habits** | Checks exits when entering rooms; sleeps light; prefers high ground | Military training creates lasting behavioral patterns |
| **First Impression** | Alert, dangerous, professional | Bounty hunters project competence to attract clients |
| **Key Experience** | A mission went wrong, civilians died, she left the service | Creates guilt, motivation for bounty work (making amends), and emotional depth |

**Identity Summary:**
- Name: Kira Valdros (she/her)
- Origin: Border fortress settlement
- Profession: Former military scout, current bounty hunter
- Habits: Checks exits, sleeps light, prefers high ground
- Appearance: Athletic build, practical clothing, several visible scars, always armed
- Formative experience: Left military after a mission resulted in civilian casualties

---

**Step 3: Assigning Attributes**

*The player wants combat effectiveness. They review the archetypes:*

| Archetype | Fit Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Physical (MIG primary) | Strong fit—military training emphasizes physical capability |
| Agile (AGI primary) | Also strong fit—scouts need stealth and quick reactions |

*Decision: MIG primary with AGI secondary. This creates a character who can hit hard and move well, fitting the "precision and overwhelming force" concept.*

| Attribute | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **MIG** | 2 | Primary. Years of physical training; carries heavy gear; overpowers targets when needed |
| **AGI** | 1 | Secondary. Scout training requires quick movement; combat reflexes from experience |
| **PRE** | 1 | Tertiary. Enough social capability to negotiate with clients and intimidate targets |
| **RSN** | 0 | Weakness. Acts on instinct rather than careful analysis; relies on training over thinking |

*This spread means Kira excels at physical confrontation, handles agile maneuvers adequately, can manage social situations when needed, and struggles with puzzles or careful planning.*

---

**Step 4: Choosing Skills**

*The player needs Skills that support both combat and the bounty hunting profession:*

| Skill Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Brawling | Yes | Direct combat capability; fits military training |
| Athletics | Yes | Running, climbing, general physical actions; essential for chases |
| Tracking | Yes | Finding targets is core to bounty hunting |
| Intimidation | Yes | Useful for both combat (causing enemies to surrender) and negotiation (pressuring informants) |
| Stealth | Rejected | Would be useful, but player prioritizes direct action over sneaking |
| Observation | Rejected | Covered partially by Tracking; RSN 0 makes mental Skills less effective |

**Skills Selected:** Brawling, Athletics, Tracking, Intimidation

*These Skills create a character who excels at physical confrontation and pursuit, with social intimidation as a backup approach.*

---

**Step 5: Choosing Proficiencies**

*The player needs Proficiencies that reflect military background and bounty hunting work:*

| Proficiency Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Military Protocol | Yes | Understanding military structures helps when dealing with guards, soldiers, former comrades |
| Weapons Maintenance | Yes | A bounty hunter's equipment must be reliable; prevents gear failures |
| Wilderness Survival | Rejected | Useful but not central to the character concept |
| Criminal Underworld | Yes | Bounty hunters work adjacent to criminals; understanding this world helps find targets |

**Proficiencies Selected:** Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Criminal Underworld

*These Proficiencies mean Kira automatically understands military ranks and procedures, keeps her equipment in working order without Checks, and knows how to navigate the criminal elements of society.*

---

**Step 6: Determining Starting Gear**

*The player selects gear that supports a combat-ready bounty hunter:*

**Basic Package:**
- Practical travel clothing (sturdy, weather-resistant)
- Military-style pack (organized, durable)
- Basic travel supplies
- Personal item: Dog tags from her unit (reminder of who she was)

**Concept-Driven Items (3):**

| Item | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Reliable sword | Primary weapon; fits setting and military background |
| Reinforced leather armor | Protection without sacrificing mobility |
| Restraints and rope | Bounty hunters need to capture targets, not just fight them |

**Weapon:**
- Sword (already counted above)

**Gear List:**
- Sturdy travel clothing
- Military pack
- Basic supplies
- Dog tags (personal item)
- Reliable sword
- Reinforced leather armor
- Restraints and rope

---

**Step 7: Establishing Background and Relationships**

**Background:**
*Kira grew up in a border settlement where military service was expected. She joined young, showed aptitude for scouting, and spent years on the frontier. A reconnaissance mission went wrong when she reported an enemy position that turned out to be a refugee camp. The garrison acted on her intelligence. She left the service after that, unable to reconcile her role in what happened.*

**Relationship:**

| NPC | Relationship | Story Potential |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Sergeant Marro | Former commanding officer | Still in the military; represents the life Kira left; possible source of contracts or conflict |

*The player leaves room for additional relationships to emerge—targets who become complicated, clients with hidden agendas, other bounty hunters.*

---

**Step 8: Defining Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads**

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Short-term goal** | Complete current contract cleanly | Establishes immediate stakes for early sessions |
| **Long-term goal** | Find a way to make amends for the refugee camp incident | Provides campaign-spanning motivation and emotional weight |
| **Drive** | Prove that her skills can protect instead of harm | Connects to backstory; explains why she takes certain jobs |
| **Personal thread** | Some of the refugees survived—where are they now? | Unresolved question the GM can use |

---

**Step 9: Final Review**

**Consistency Check:**
- Concept (military scout turned bounty hunter) matches MIG/AGI build
- Skills (Brawling, Athletics, Tracking, Intimidation) support combat and pursuit
- Proficiencies (Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Criminal Underworld) reflect background
- Gear (sword, armor, restraints) fits profession
- Goals connect to backstory tragedy

**Complete Character Sheet:**

**Kira Valdros**
- **Concept:** Former military scout turned bounty hunter who uses precision and overwhelming force
- **Attributes:** MIG 2, AGI 1, PRE 1, RSN 0
- **Skills:** Brawling, Athletics, Tracking, Intimidation
- **Proficiencies:** Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Criminal Underworld
- **Gear:** Sturdy travel clothing, military pack, sword, reinforced leather armor, restraints and rope, dog tags
- **Background:** Border fortress settlement; left military after reconnaissance error led to civilian casualties
- **Relationship:** Sergeant Marro (former CO)
- **Goals:** Complete contracts cleanly (short-term); make amends for past mistakes (long-term)
- **Drive:** Prove her skills can protect instead of harm
- **Thread:** Where are the survivors of the refugee camp?

---

#### Worked Example 2: Delian Osk — Social/Investigative Character (PRE/RSN)

**Final Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden.

---

**Step 1: Choosing the Concept**

*The player wants a character focused on investigation and social manipulation rather than combat. They consider several options:*

| Option Considered | Rejected Because | Selected Because |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| "Detective" | Generic; needs more texture | — |
| "Con artist" | Fun but lacks investigative focus | — |
| "Journalist" | Good but player wants seedier angle | — |
| "Insurance investigator" | — | Combines investigation (finding fraud) with social skills (interviewing) and built-in moral ambiguity |

*Decision: "Disgraced insurance investigator" adds the "disgraced" element for story hooks—why were they disgraced? What did they do? This creates a character who knows how systems work but operates outside them now.*

**Final Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden.

---

**Step 2: Defining Identity Elements**

*The player develops specific details that support an investigative, socially adept character:*

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Name** | Delian Osk (they/them) | Slightly formal name fits professional background; gender-neutral presentation suits someone who observes rather than stands out |
| **Origin** | Major commercial city | Insurance work happens in urban centers; explains understanding of business and bureaucracy |
| **Former Role** | Senior fraud investigator for major insurance firm | Specific title suggests expertise and authority |
| **Habits** | Takes notes constantly; asks questions that seem casual but are not; never sits with back to door | Professional habits from years of investigation |
| **First Impression** | Forgettable until they start talking; then uncomfortably perceptive | Investigators benefit from being underestimated |
| **Key Experience** | Uncovered fraud that implicated powerful people; was discredited and fired rather than allowed to publish findings | Explains "disgraced" element and creates enemies |

**Identity Summary:**
- Name: Delian Osk (they/them)
- Origin: Major commercial city
- Profession: Former senior fraud investigator, current freelance investigator
- Habits: Constant note-taking, probing questions, situational awareness
- Appearance: Unremarkable clothing, plain face, sharp eyes, always has a notebook
- Formative experience: Discovered fraud reaching highest levels; silenced and discredited

---

**Step 3: Assigning Attributes**

*The player reviews archetypes for investigation/social focus:*

| Archetype | Fit Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Social (PRE primary) | Strong fit—investigation requires interviewing, persuading, reading people |
| Analytical (RSN primary) | Also strong fit—investigation requires analysis, deduction, connecting evidence |

*Decision: PRE primary with RSN secondary. The player decides Delian succeeds more through reading people and social manipulation than pure analysis. They get information from people, not just documents.*

| Attribute | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **PRE** | 2 | Primary. Interviews are their main tool; reading people, persuading witnesses, blending in socially |
| **RSN** | 1 | Secondary. Still capable of analysis and deduction; just not their leading strength |
| **AGI** | 1 | Tertiary. Enough coordination to handle basic physical tasks; can run if needed |
| **MIG** | 0 | Weakness. Avoids physical confrontation entirely; relies on wit over strength |

*This spread means Delian excels at social interaction and manipulation, handles analytical work adequately, can manage basic physical situations, and must avoid or talk their way out of fights.*

---

**Step 4: Choosing Skills**

*The player needs Skills that support investigation and social manipulation:*

| Skill Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Investigation | Yes | Core to concept; finding hidden information |
| Persuasion | Yes | Getting people to talk, share information, cooperate |
| Deception | Yes | Sometimes investigation requires pretending to be someone else |
| Observation | Yes | Noticing details others miss; reading body language |
| Empathy | Rejected | Covered somewhat by Observation; Persuasion handles social connection |
| Research | Rejected | Would be useful but RSN is secondary; prioritize PRE-based Skills |

**Skills Selected:** Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation

*These Skills create a character who excels at finding and extracting information through social means.*

---

**Step 5: Choosing Proficiencies**

*The player needs Proficiencies that reflect the investigator background:*

| Proficiency Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Legal Procedures | Yes | Investigators need to understand how official systems work |
| Commercial Operations | Yes | Insurance fraud requires understanding business; useful for many investigations |
| Academic Circles | Rejected | Not central to the character's background |
| Urban Navigation | Yes | Investigators work in cities; knowing how to find people and places matters |

**Proficiencies Selected:** Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation

*These Proficiencies mean Delian automatically understands court processes and legal documents, knows how businesses operate and where fraud hides, and can navigate urban environments efficiently.*

---

**Step 6: Determining Starting Gear**

*The player selects gear that supports an investigator who works through social means:*

**Basic Package:**
- Professional but unremarkable clothing (blends into business settings)
- Leather satchel (holds documents and notebooks)
- Basic travel supplies
- Personal item: A letter of commendation from their former employer (reminder of what they lost)

**Concept-Driven Items (3):**

| Item | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Multiple notebooks and writing supplies | Constant note-taking is central to their method |
| Set of forged credentials | Sometimes investigation requires being someone else |
| Contact list and reference documents | Years of work built a network; this represents that knowledge |

**Weapon:**
- Small concealed knife (for emergencies only; Delian avoids violence)

**Gear List:**
- Professional clothing
- Leather satchel
- Basic supplies
- Letter of commendation (personal item)
- Notebooks and writing supplies
- Forged credentials
- Contact list and reference documents
- Small concealed knife

---

**Step 7: Establishing Background and Relationships**

**Background:**
*Delian spent fifteen years as a fraud investigator for one of the largest insurance firms in the city. They were good—too good. When they uncovered a fraud scheme that implicated several council members and a noble family, they reported it through proper channels. The investigation was buried. Delian was accused of fabricating evidence, fired publicly, and blacklisted from legitimate work. Now they take private cases, operating in the space between legal and illegal, trying to do the work that matters while surviving on the margins.*

**Relationship:**

| NPC | Relationship | Story Potential |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Councilor Veth | Enemy | One of the people Delian tried to expose; still in power; would benefit from Delian's permanent silence |
| Marek, newspaper editor | Former ally | Believed Delian's evidence but could not publish; feels guilty; might help if approached carefully |

*Two relationships provide both threat (Veth) and potential support (Marek).*

---

**Step 8: Defining Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads**

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Short-term goal** | Build reputation as a reliable private investigator | Establishes immediate economic pressure and motivation to take cases |
| **Long-term goal** | Expose the people who destroyed their career | Campaign-spanning goal that connects to backstory |
| **Drive** | The truth matters more than comfort or safety | Explains why they keep investigating despite the cost |
| **Personal thread** | What happened to the evidence they gathered? Someone must still have it | Unresolved question the GM can use |

---

**Step 9: Final Review**

**Consistency Check:**
- Concept (disgraced investigator) matches PRE/RSN build
- Skills (Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation) support social investigation
- Proficiencies (Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation) reflect background
- Gear (notebooks, credentials, contacts) fits profession
- Goals connect to backstory injustice

**Complete Character Sheet:**

**Delian Osk**
- **Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden
- **Attributes:** PRE 2, RSN 1, AGI 1, MIG 0
- **Skills:** Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation
- **Proficiencies:** Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation
- **Gear:** Professional clothing, leather satchel, notebooks and writing supplies, forged credentials, contact list, small concealed knife, letter of commendation
- **Background:** Former senior fraud investigator; discredited after uncovering high-level corruption
- **Relationships:** Councilor Veth (enemy who silenced them); Marek the editor (guilty former ally)
- **Goals:** Build reputation as private investigator (short-term); expose those who destroyed their career (long-term)
- **Drive:** The truth matters more than comfort or safety

## 9. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive. They connect description to mechanics so that rain, fear, injuries, crowds, and looming deadlines all matter at the table. This chapter explains what each of these tools is for, how to use them, and how they interact with Checks.

### Tags vs. Conditions

**Tags** describe **the environment or situation**. They belong to places, scenes, objects, or circumstances: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, *Crowded*, *Fragile Cover*. Tags affect what you can do in a space and how you do it.

**Conditions** describe **your character's state**. They follow you from one location to the next until cleared: *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*, *Frightened*, *Restrained*. Conditions affect your actions wherever you go.

Tags and Conditions are the shared vocabulary the table uses to talk about advantages, risks, and lingering consequences. They are not extra subsystems to memorize. They are the names you give to things you are already describing.

### What Tags Do

A Tag is a short descriptor applied to a scene, location, object, or situation. It becomes a flag: "remember this when resolving actions here." Tags typically:

- Grant Edge or Burden on certain Checks.
- Raise or lower DCs for specific actions.
- Change position or effect (how risky an action feels or how big its impact is).

You do not tag every detail. A room is just a room until its darkness, instability, crowd, or sacred significance matters to what characters are attempting. Tag the things that will shape decisions.

### How Tags Affect Checks

Tags translate fictional circumstances into mechanical modifiers. When a Tag is relevant to a Check, it typically grants Edge or imposes Burden based on whether the circumstance helps or hinders the action.

**The Basic Rule:** If a Tag makes an action easier, it grants Edge. If a Tag makes an action harder, it imposes Burden. Some Tags do both depending on what you are attempting.

> **Common Tag Effects**
>
> | Tag | Grants Edge On | Imposes Burden On |
> |-----|----------------|-------------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Stealth, hiding, ambush | Sight-based Checks, ranged attacks at distance, reading or fine work |
> | *Slick* | Sliding into cover, pushing opponents | Movement, balance, standing quickly, pursuit |
> | *Elevated* | Ranged attacks from above, surveying area | Being targeted from below (opponents get Edge), climbing down under pressure |
> | *Cramped* | Fighting with short weapons, grappling | Wide swings, large weapons, group coordination |
> | *Chaotic* | Misdirection, blending in, escaping notice | Coordination, communication, finding specific people |
> | *Formal* | Proper etiquette, official requests | Informal approaches, casual conversation, blending in without credentials |

When multiple Tags apply, combine their effects. If one Tag grants Edge and another imposes Burden on the same Check, they cancel out. If two Tags both grant Edge, you gain +2 Edge (capped at the normal maximum). The GM adjudicates edge cases based on the fiction.

> **Note**
> Not every Tag affects every Check. A *Dim Light* Tag has no bearing on a Persuasion attempt unless visibility is specifically relevant to the conversation. Apply Tags when they logically matter.

### Common Tags Quick Reference

> **Common Tags Quick Reference**
>
> Use this table during play to quickly identify how Tags affect actions.
>
> **Environmental Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Burden on vision-based actions; Edge on Stealth | Dusk, candlelight, fog, shuttered windows |
> | *Darkness* | Severe Burden or impossible for sight-based tasks | Night without light sources, underground |
> | *Slick* | Burden on movement and balance Checks | Rain, ice, oil spills, wet stone |
> | *Cramped* | Burden on wide swings and large movements | Narrow passages, crowded rooms, tunnels |
> | *Elevated* | Edge on ranged attacks from above; risk of falling | Rooftops, balconies, cliff edges |
> | *Solid Cover* | Edge on defense; blocks line of sight | Stone walls, heavy furniture, vehicles |
> | *Fragile Cover* | Limited protection; can be destroyed | Wooden crates, thin walls, market stalls |
> | *Unstable* | Risk of collapse; Burden on careful actions | Old bridges, crumbling floors, scaffolding |
>
> **Situational Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Outnumbered* | Burden on defense; enemies may gang up | Multiple foes vs. fewer defenders |
> | *Flanked* | Burden on defense against flanking attacks | Enemies on opposite sides |
> | *Surprised* | Cannot act in first round; Burden on initial reactions | Ambush, failed awareness Check |
> | *Exposed* | Burden on defense; easy target | No cover, caught in open ground |
> | *Hazardous* | Risk of harm from environment; may tick threat Clocks | Fire, toxic fumes, electrical danger |
> | *Surveillance* | Actions may be observed and reported | Guards, cameras, informants nearby |
>
> **Atmospheric Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Tense* | Social missteps escalate quickly; Burden on calming actions | Standoffs, negotiations, high stakes |
> | *Chaotic* | Burden on coordination; opportunities for misdirection | Riots, battles, emergencies |
> | *Formal* | Burden on informal approaches; Edge for proper etiquette | Courts, ceremonies, official meetings |
> | *Suspicious* | Burden on trust-building; increased scrutiny | After crimes, with strangers, in enemy territory |

You can invent new Tags that fit your setting. The important part is agreeing at the table what a Tag does in practice: which actions it helps, which it hinders, and how it shapes consequences.

> **Example - Tags in a Warehouse Fight**
> The GM describes a warehouse full of stacked crates, narrow aisles, and oil-spotted floors. They assign the Tags *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, and *Slick*.
> *Cramped* makes wide swings and large weapons awkward. *Fragile Cover* means wooden crates can be shredded by fire, potentially stripping cover away. *Slick* imposes Burden on fast movement or acrobatic maneuvers. Every decision in this scene now has texture.

### What Conditions Do

Conditions represent persistent states that modify what a character can safely attempt. They are the mechanical mark left by consequences. When something important happens to you—injury, fear, strain, affliction—it often becomes a Condition.

Conditions typically:

- Impose Burden on certain actions.
- Limit available options (cannot run, cannot act this turn, cannot speak clearly).
- Threaten further harm if ignored (ongoing damage, ticking Clocks).

### Condition Quick Reference

Use this table to quickly determine how common Conditions affect play:

> **Condition Quick Reference**
>
> | Condition | Mechanical Effect | Clearing Method | Example Source |
> |-----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
> | *Exhausted* | Burden on all physically demanding Checks (climbing, fighting, running) | Rest for at least one scene; receive meaningful aid or restorative treatment | Prolonged exertion, sleep deprivation, sustained hardship |
> | *Bleeding* | Tick a personal 4-segment "Bleed Out" Clock each scene if untreated; when filled, you fall unconscious | Stabilization Check (DC 14), medical treatment, or appropriate Proficiency | Serious wounds, failed combat Checks, environmental hazards |
> | *Frightened* | Burden on all Checks while the source of fear is visible or immediately threatening | Rally (successful PRE Check), escape the source, or defeat/neutralize the threat | Supernatural terror, overwhelming force, failed morale Check |
> | *Disarmed* | Cannot use your primary weapon; Burden on attacks until you recover it or draw another | Retrieve the weapon (action), draw a backup weapon, or disarm your opponent | Enemy maneuver, failed grapple, successful disarm action against you |
> | *Prone* | Burden on melee attacks and defense; Edge for enemies attacking you in melee; cannot move normally | Stand up (costs movement or minor action); an ally can help you up | Knocked down, tripped, diving for cover, failed balance Check |

Additional Conditions appear in the Extended Tags and Conditions Reference chapter. When you create custom Conditions, ensure each one has a clear mechanical effect and an achievable clearing method.

### Examples of Common Conditions

A full alphabetical list appears in the Glossary. Here are a few you will see often:

- **Exhausted** - Burden on demanding physical actions until you rest or receive meaningful aid.
- **Bleeding** - Time pressure from an untreated wound. If not stabilized, it may tick a personal Clock or escalate to worse states.
- **Restrained** - You are held or pinned. You cannot move freely and must break free or be helped.
- **Dazed** - Disoriented; Burden on perception and reaction until you recover.
- **Frightened** - Burden on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when you rally, escape, or defeat the source.

> **Example - From Event to Condition**
> A character fails a Check while crossing a compromised catwalk. Rather than simple damage, the GM describes how they slam into the railing and twist their knee. They gain the Condition *Exhausted* or *Weakened*, representing reduced stamina. Future physical actions are harder until they rest or receive treatment.

### Using Tags and Conditions with Checks

Tags and Conditions do not require new rules. They plug directly into the Check system:

- Tags often grant Edge or Burden on Checks that interact with them.
- Conditions usually impose Burden or limit which approaches are reasonable.
- Some Tags shift DCs or change position and effect instead of modifying dice directly.

When you are about to roll, quickly review which Tags and Conditions are relevant. Ask: "Does this make the action easier, harder, or riskier?" Then adjust Edge/Burden, DC, or consequences accordingly.

> **Example - Tag and Condition Interaction**
> In a horror-tinged mystery, a character stalks through a foggy graveyard at night. The scene has Tags *Dim Light* and *Obscured*. The character is also *Frightened* from a previous encounter.
> When they attempt to sneak past patrolling figures, *Dim Light* and *Obscured* might grant Edge on Stealth, but *Frightened* could impose Burden on actions taken while the threat is visible. The GM weighs these factors, cancels opposing modifiers as needed, and describes how the character's shaky nerves show up in the fiction.

### Introducing and Clearing Conditions

Conditions should follow naturally from events. A failed Check in a hazardous area might cause *Bleeding* or *Poisoned*. Exposure to overwhelming sights might cause *Frightened*. Pushing beyond safe limits might cause *Exhausted*.

When you introduce a Condition, state:

- What it represents in the fiction.
- How it affects actions (which Checks it modifies and how).
- How it can be cleared (time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock).

Minor Conditions should clear quickly once addressed. Major Conditions may persist across several scenes or form the basis for character-driven goals.

### What Clocks Are

Clocks are segmented trackers that answer "how close are we?" for goals and threats. A Clock is a circle or track divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments. As actions succeed, time passes, or events occur, segments fill. When the Clock completes, something happens.

Use Clocks to represent:

- **Long-term goals** - Research projects, faction plans, character endeavors.
- **Mounting threats** - Approaching storms, advancing enemies, spreading plagues.
- **Ticking dangers** - Rituals completing, bombs counting down, collapsing structures.
- **Faction projects** - Off-screen activities of NPCs and organizations.

### Clock Advancement Guide

Understanding when and how Clocks advance is crucial for pacing and tension. Use these guidelines:

> **Clock Advancement by Check Outcome**
>
> This table provides default tick rates. Specific actions, abilities, or circumstances may override these defaults at GM discretion.
>
> | Check Outcome | Progress Clock | Threat/Opposing Clock | Notes |
> |---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
> | **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments | No advance | Exceptional progress; choose 3 segments for breakthrough moments |
> | **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments | No advance | Standard progress; use 2 segments for well-executed plans |
> | **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment | May tick 1 segment | Progress with complication; the complication often manifests as threat Clock advancement |
> | **Failure** | No progress | Tick 1-2 segments | Setback; threat advances while goal stalls |
> | **Critical Failure** | No progress | Tick 2-3 segments | Serious setback; may also introduce new Conditions or Tags |

> **GM Guidance - Clock Advancement Defaults**
> The table above establishes a mechanical baseline. Use it as your starting point, then adjust based on the fiction. A character with a relevant Proficiency might tick an extra segment on success. An action that is particularly risky or loud might tick threat Clocks even on success. The defaults ensure consistent pacing; your judgment ensures the fiction makes sense.

#### Multi-Clock Guidance

When multiple Clocks are active, use this decision process:

1. **Identify the primary Clock.** Ask: "Which Clock does this action most directly affect?" Advance that Clock based on the outcome.

2. **Consider secondary effects.** If the action is loud, risky, or draws attention, ask: "Does this also affect a threat Clock?" If yes, tick it.

3. **Handle ambiguous actions.** When an action could affect multiple Clocks:
   - If the player's intent was clear, honor that intent
   - If uncertain, advance the Clock most connected to their stated approach
   - For truly split actions, consider ticking both at reduced rates

> **Decision Flowchart: Which Clock Advances?**
>
> ```
> Action Taken
>     |
>     v
> Does the action directly target a specific Clock?
>     |
>     +-- YES -> Advance that Clock based on outcome
>     |         |
>     |         v
>     |    Was the action loud, risky, or attention-drawing?
>     |         |
>     |         +-- YES -> Also tick the most relevant threat Clock
>     |         +-- NO  -> Done
>     |
>     +-- NO -> Which Clock is most affected by this approach?
>              |
>              v
>         Advance that Clock; consider threat Clocks if failure occurred
> ```

### Advancing Clocks

Clocks advance in several ways:

- **Success-based** - Successful Checks tick a project Clock forward.
- **Time-based** - Segments fill as scenes pass or as in-world time moves.
- **Event-based** - Specific narrative events advance background or faction Clocks.

Partial successes often advance a Clock and introduce a complication. Exceptional successes may jump a Clock by more than one segment. Failures might leave a Clock unchanged while pushing forward a related threat Clock.

### Opposing Clocks: A Worked Example

> **Example - Investigation vs. Cover-Up**
>
> The group is investigating a corrupt official while the official works to destroy evidence.
>
> **Clocks:**
> - "Expose the Official" - 6-segment Clock (investigation progress)
> - "Cover-Up Complete" - 4-segment Clock (enemy countermeasures)
>
> **Round 1:** The investigator searches the official's office.
> - *Check:* RSN-based Investigation against DC 16 (Tough—the office has been partially cleaned)
> - *Result:* Full Success (margin +2)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 2 segments. Found a ledger with suspicious entries.
> - *Threat Clock:* No advance—the search was quiet and unnoticed.
>
> **Round 2:** The investigator questions a nervous clerk.
> - *Check:* PRE-based Persuasion against DC 14 (Routine)
> - *Result:* Partial Success (margin -1)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 1 segment. Clerk reveals a name but is visibly frightened.
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 1 segment. The clerk will warn the official.
>
> **Round 3:** The official learns of the investigation and begins destroying documents.
> - *Event-based:* GM ticks "Cover-Up" 1 segment automatically (faction action).
> - "Cover-Up" now at 2/4 segments.
>
> **Round 4:** The investigator tries to intercept the document destruction.
> - *Check:* AGI-based Stealth against DC 16 (Tough—guards are alert)
> - *Result:* Failure (margin -4)
> - *Effect:* No progress on "Expose."
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 2 segments. Guards catch the investigator; documents are burned.
> - "Cover-Up" fills to 4/4—evidence destroyed!
>
> **Outcome:** The Cover-Up Clock filled first. The official escapes immediate exposure, but the investigator has partial evidence (3/6 on "Expose"). The story continues with new stakes: can they find other witnesses before the official silences them?

### Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

These tools are most powerful when used together:

- Tags set the stage: terrain, lighting, crowds, magical effects.
- Conditions show how previous events cling to characters and shape their options.
- Clocks track momentum toward outcomes that matter over time.

A single scene might involve a *Hazardous* Tag, characters who are *Exhausted*, and a "Structural Collapse" Clock. Every roll becomes a meaningful choice about risk, effort, and timing.

> **GM Guidance - Start Small**
> You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene. Start with one or two Tags that matter, a few Conditions that arise naturally, and a single important Clock. Add more only when they clarify the fiction rather than clutter it. When in doubt, ask: "Does this tool make the situation clearer and more interesting?" If yes, use it.

### Chapter Summary

Tags describe environments and situations; Conditions describe character states; Clocks track progress toward outcomes. Use the Common Tags table and Common Tag Effects summary for quick reference during play. The Condition Quick Reference provides mechanical effects and clearing methods for the most frequent Conditions. Apply the Clock Advancement by Check Outcome table to maintain consistent pacing—these defaults give you a mechanical baseline before applying GM judgment. When multiple Clocks compete, let the fiction guide which advances. These tools work together to make the world feel responsive and stakes feel real.

## 8. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

This chapter describes the core resolution engine of the game. Whenever a character takes an action and the outcome is uncertain, consequential, and within their reach to influence, the table may call for a Check. Checks turn intent and approach into dice, and dice back into story beats. Understanding how to call for, perform, and interpret Checks is essential for both players and the GM.

### When to Roll (and When Not To)

You roll when the GM calls for a Check. The GM should only do this when three conditions are all true:

- **Uncertainty**: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal conditions does not roll.
- **Consequence**: Failure or partial success would introduce tension, cost, or change. If failure just means "try again until it works," do not roll.
- **Agency**: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Do not roll for things entirely outside the characters' control.

If all three are present, a Check is appropriate. If one or more are missing, the GM either says "yes" and narrates success, or "no" and explains why it is impossible or out of scope. Checks are tools for focusing on interesting uncertainty, not a gate in front of every action.

> **Example – When to Roll**
> *Trigger:* A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous.
> *Assessment:* The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character's choices matter. The GM calls for a Check.
> *Counter-example:* The same character crossing a sturdy bridge in calm weather does not roll. Success is assumed; the story moves forward.

### The Core Check Procedure

Every Check follows the same basic loop:

1. The player declares intent and approach.
1. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
1. If needed, the GM selects an Attribute and relevant Skill, sets a DC, and notes any Tags, Conditions, or Proficiencies that might grant Edge or Burden.
1. The player rolls **4d6**, applies modifiers, and compares the total to the DC.
1. The table interprets the outcome tier (critical success, full success, partial success, failure, critical failure) and updates the fiction accordingly.

### Declaring Intent and Approach

When you declare an action, you state two things:

- **Intent**: What you want to achieve in the fiction.
- **Approach**: How you are trying to achieve it.

Intent focuses the scene. Approach determines which Attribute, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and Conditions are relevant. The more concrete and grounded your description, the easier it is for the GM to set an appropriate DC and for the group to picture the moment.

> **Example – Intent and Approach**
> *Intent:* "I want to get the factory foreman to delay shipment of the crates."
> *Approach:* "I speak with her in private, emphasize the safety risks, and show her evidence of the faulty wiring we found."
> The GM recognizes this as a PRE-based approach with a relevant social Skill and possibly a Proficiency related to safety procedures or technical documentation.

### Setting DCs

The GM sets a **Difficulty Class (DC)** to represent how hard the task is under current circumstances. The system uses a standard ladder:

#### Standard DC Ladder

| DC | Difficulty | When to Use | Concrete Examples |
|----|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **12** | Easy | Favorable conditions, strong fictional positioning, minor obstacles, or when the character has clear advantages | Climbing a rough stone wall with plenty of handholds; persuading a friendly contact to share non-sensitive information; recalling common knowledge about a familiar topic |
| **14** | Routine | Standard conditions, typical challenges, no special advantage or disadvantage, baseline competent opposition | Picking a standard lock with proper tools; convincing a neutral stranger to provide directions; tracking fresh footprints on soft ground |
| **16** | Tough | Unfavorable conditions, skilled opposition, time pressure, or when the character lacks ideal resources | Convincing a suspicious guard to let you pass without credentials; climbing a smooth wall with few handholds; recalling obscure historical details under pressure |
| **18** | Hard | Hostile conditions, significant obstacles, high stakes, or active countermeasures from opposition | Disarming a complex trap while enemies approach; persuading a hostile official to overlook a minor crime; picking a high-quality lock without specialized tools |
| **20** | Heroic | Extreme conditions, exceptional challenges, pushing the limits of what trained individuals can accomplish | Leaping between rooftops in a thunderstorm; convincing a mob to disperse without violence; navigating treacherous terrain while wounded and exhausted |
| **22** | Legendary | Near-impossible feats, setting-defining moments, the absolute edge of mortal capability | Talking down a raging dragon mid-attack; climbing a sheer ice cliff during a blizzard without equipment; deciphering an alien language in minutes |

Start by imagining what success would look like in the scene and how far it is from effortless. Use lower DCs when characters have strong fictional positioning, good information, and safe conditions. Use higher DCs when time is short, the environment is hostile, or the task is at the edge of what is possible in the setting.

> **Note**
> DCs should reflect fictional positioning, not abstract difficulty. The same task might be DC 14 in good conditions and DC 18 in poor conditions. Let the story guide the number.

> **GM Guidance**
> When selecting a DC, ask yourself: "What would make this task harder or easier?" Consider the character's preparation, available tools, environmental factors, and opposition awareness. A well-prepared character attempting a task in favorable conditions deserves a lower DC than an improvising character under hostile circumstances.

### Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions

Rather than constantly adjusting the DC, the game often represents favorable or unfavorable circumstances through **Edge** and **Burden**.

> **Edge and Burden Quick Reference**
>
> | Modifier | Dice Change | Common Sources |
> |----------|-------------|----------------|
> | **+1 Edge** | Roll 5d6, keep best 4 | Good positioning, helpful Tag, ally assistance, right tools |
> | **+2 Edge** | Roll 6d6, keep best 4 | Exceptional setup, multiple advantages combined, perfect conditions |
> | **-1 Burden** | Roll 5d6, keep worst 4 | Unfavorable Tag, minor Condition, poor visibility, improvised tools |
> | **-2 Burden** | Roll 6d6, keep worst 4 | Severe Condition, multiple disadvantages, hostile environment |
>
> **Stacking:** Multiple sources combine into a single level, capped at ±2. If you have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (e.g., +2 Edge and -1 Burden = +1 Edge).

Edge and Burden usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies, or prior setup actions. They represent the table's shared sense that the character is favored or hindered in this moment. Multiple sources combine into a single level of Edge or Burden and are capped at ±2—several small edges do not create infinite Edge, and multiple problems do not push you below −2. If a character would have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (for example, +2 and −1 becomes +1) until only one side remains, then apply the final level.

Tags and Conditions described in earlier chapters provide a shared vocabulary for these modifiers: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, or *Exposed* might impose Burden; *Solid Cover* or *Marked* might grant Edge in specific contexts or to specific parties.

### Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

When a Check is called for, follow this procedure:

1. Roll **4d6**, adjusting the number of dice kept if Edge or Burden applies.
1. Add the relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects.
1. Compare the total to the DC to find the **margin** (Roll − DC).

The margin determines the outcome tier. Use the following ranges to identify which tier applies:

#### Outcome Tier Margin Ranges

| Margin Range | Outcome Tier | Summary |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **+5 or more** | Critical Success | Exceptional result; exceed your goal with bonus benefits |
| **0 to +4** | Full Success | Clean success; achieve your intent without significant cost |
| **-1 to -2** | Partial Success | Success with cost; achieve your goal but pay a price |
| **-3 to -6** | Failure | Goal not achieved; situation worsens or complicates |
| **-7 or worse** | Critical Failure | Significant setback; major escalation or consequence |

> **Note**
> Rolling all 1s on your dice (before keeping) also triggers a **Critical Failure**, regardless of margin. This represents catastrophic bad luck.

### Interpreting Outcomes

Every outcome tier should change the situation. The GM and players work together to describe what the dice mean in the fiction.

- **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more) – You achieve more than you aimed for. Extra benefits, stronger position, or accelerated progress. In combat, this often means additional Clock ticks or bonus effects.
- **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) – You get what you wanted with no significant cost. The scene moves forward cleanly. Your intent is fulfilled as stated.
- **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2) – You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect. Momentum continues, tension rises. Common costs include: resource expenditure, unwanted attention, reduced scope of success, or new obligations.
- **Failure** (margin -3 to -6) – You do not achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Threats advance, resources strain, or positions worsen. The GM should advance threat Clocks or introduce new complications.
- **Critical Failure** (margin -7 or worse, or all 1s) – Things go significantly wrong. Use sparingly for dramatic beats: broken tools, dangerous exposure, or major escalations. This is not punishment—it is an opportunity for dramatic tension.

> **Outcome Tiers Quick Reference**
>
> | Margin | Outcome Tier | Typical Result | Example |
> |--------|--------------|----------------|---------|
> | **+5 or more** | Critical Success | Exceed your goal with bonus benefits | Pick the lock silently AND notice the trap behind it |
> | **0 to +4** | Full Success | Achieve your intent cleanly | Pick the lock without issue |
> | **-1 to -2** | Partial Success | Succeed with cost or complication | Pick the lock but make noise or damage your picks |
> | **-3 to -6** | Failure | Do not succeed; situation worsens | Lock resists; guards become suspicious |
> | **-7 or worse** (or all 1s) | Critical Failure | Significant setback or escalation | Lock jams; alarm triggers; tool breaks |

### Worked Examples

The following examples demonstrate complete Check resolution from intent through outcome. Study these to understand how the mechanical sequence flows in actual play.

> **Example – Social Check with Partial Success**
>
> *Scene:* Mira needs to convince a merchant to sell rare components at a fair price. The merchant is greedy but not hostile.
>
> *Intent:* "I want the merchant to sell me the precision lenses at cost."
> *Approach:* "I appeal to his reputation among the guild, mentioning that fair dealing now will bring future business from my contacts."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is a PRE-based Check using a social Skill. The merchant is motivated by profit but values his reputation. DC 14 (Routine social negotiation with a neutral party).
>
> *Modifiers:* Mira has the Negotiation Skill (+1) and mentions her guild contacts, which the GM rules is good fictional positioning but not quite Edge-worthy on its own.
>
> *Roll:* Mira rolls 4d6: 2, 3, 4, 5 = 14. Adding PRE +2 and Skill +1 = 17.
> *Margin:* 17 - 14 = +3.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The merchant agrees to sell at cost, impressed by Mira's guild connections and the promise of future business. She obtains the precision lenses without complication.
>
> ---
>
> *Alternate Roll:* Suppose Mira had rolled 4d6: 1, 2, 3, 4 = 10. Adding PRE +2 and Skill +1 = 13.
> *Margin:* 13 - 14 = -1.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The merchant agrees to sell the lenses at cost, but names his price: Mira must bring him first pick of salvage from her next job. She has the components she needs, but now owes a favor that may prove inconvenient later.

> **Example – Combat Check with Strike Outcome and Clock Ticks**
>
> *Scene:* During a warehouse fight, Kira faces a hired thug. The environment is marked with *Crates* (cover) and *Dim Light*. Kira's ally Dex used a **Set Up** action last turn to flank the thug, granting Kira Edge.
>
> *Intent:* "I want to take down this thug before reinforcements arrive."
> *Approach:* "I strike at his weapon arm, trying to disarm and disable him quickly."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is an AGI-based **Strike** action. The thug is a standard combatant with a 6-segment Resolve Clock. DC 16 (Tough—the thug is trained and alert).
>
> *Modifiers:*
> - +1 Edge from Dex's flanking setup
> - *Dim Light* would normally impose Burden, but Kira has low-light training (negated)
>
> *Roll:* With +1 Edge, Kira rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Keeping 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Adding AGI +2 = 20.
> *Margin:* 20 - 16 = +4.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) = **Clear Strike**.
>
> *Mechanical Result:* A Clear Strike ticks the target's Resolve Clock by 2 segments. The thug's Resolve Clock advances from 0/6 to 2/6.
>
> *Narrative Result:* Kira's blade connects cleanly with the thug's forearm. He grunts in pain and his grip loosens on his weapon. He is hurt and shaken but still fighting. Two more solid hits and he will go down.

> **Example – Skill Check with Edge and Burden Modifiers**
>
> *Scene:* Vance attempts to pick a locked door in the basement of a noble's estate. The environment is marked with *Dim Light* (Burden) and Vance is working with borrowed tools rather than his own precision set. However, an ally spent time earlier casing the lock mechanism, providing useful information.
>
> *Intent:* "I want to open this lock without triggering any alarms."
> *Approach:* "I work carefully, applying what Sera told me about the lock's design, and take my time to avoid mistakes."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is an AGI-based Check using Technical Work Skill. The lock is high-quality. DC 18 (Hard—sophisticated lock in unfavorable conditions).
>
> *Modifiers:*
> - -1 Burden from *Dim Light* (impairs precision work)
> - -1 Burden from improvised tools (borrowed picks, not his custom set)
> - +1 Edge from Sera's reconnaissance (useful information about the mechanism)
> - Net modifier: +1 Edge + (-2 Burden) = -1 Burden total
>
> *Roll:* With -1 Burden, Vance rolls 5d6 and keeps the worst 4: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Keeping 1, 2, 4, 5 = 12. Adding AGI +3 and Technical Work +1 = 16.
> *Margin:* 16 - 18 = -2.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The lock clicks open—Vance's skill overcomes the poor conditions. However, the effort takes longer than expected, and one of his borrowed picks snaps inside the mechanism. He will need to explain the broken tool to its owner, and the damaged lock may be noticed when the household checks security in the morning. He is in, but evidence of his passage remains.

### Strike Outcomes

When you make a **Strike** action in combat, the outcome tier determines both the damage dealt and any additional effects. Strikes interact directly with target Resolve Clocks.

#### Strike Outcome Table

| Outcome Tier | Result | Resolve Clock Effect | Additional Consequences |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more) | Devastating Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 3 segments | Choose one: apply a relevant Condition (*Staggered*, *Bleeding*, *Disarmed*), gain immediate positioning for next action, or deny target their next reaction |
| **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) | Clear Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 2 segments | Clean hit with no complications; maintain your position |
| **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2) | Glancing Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 1 segment | Target may respond: GM ticks a threat Clock by 1 OR target gains minor positioning (chooses engagement distance, cover, etc.) |
| **Failure** (margin -3 to -6) | Miss | No Resolve Clock progress | GM chooses: tick a threat Clock by 1 segment OR target gains positioning advantage OR environmental complication |
| **Critical Failure** (margin -7 or worse) | Disastrous Miss | No Resolve Clock progress | GM chooses two consequences from the Failure list, OR one major consequence (weapon stuck, fall prone, ally endangered, etc.) |

> **Note**
> Threat Clocks represent dangers to the attacking character or their allies: "Reinforcements Arrive," "Escaping Target," "Collateral Damage," etc. The GM establishes relevant threat Clocks at the start of combat or introduces them as the situation develops.

#### Strike Mechanics Summary

- **Clear Strike** (Full Success): Your attack connects solidly. Tick the target's Resolve Clock by 2 segments. This is the baseline effective hit.
- **Glancing Strike** (Partial Success): You land a blow, but not cleanly. Tick the target's Resolve Clock by 1 segment. The target gains an opportunity: either a threat Clock advances, or the target improves their tactical position.
- **Miss** (Failure): Your attack fails to connect meaningfully. The target suffers no Resolve damage. Instead, the situation worsens for you: threat Clocks advance, the target repositions, or the environment becomes more dangerous.

> **Example – Strike Outcomes in Sequence**
>
> *Round 1:* Kira (Clear Strike) hits the thug for 2 Resolve ticks (now 2/6).
> *Round 2:* The thug attacks Kira. The GM rolls a Glancing Strike—Kira takes 1 Resolve tick, and the "Reinforcements Arrive" Clock ticks by 1 (the noise draws attention).
> *Round 3:* Kira attacks again but rolls a Miss. The thug takes no damage, but the GM ticks "Reinforcements Arrive" by 1 more—it is now 2/4. Kira must end this fight quickly.

### Group Checks and Assistance

Many actions involve more than one character. Rather than rolling for everyone separately every time, the GM can use:

- **Assistance**: One character leads the action, another assists. If the assistance is credible in the fiction, the leader gains Edge or a small bonus.
- **Representative Checks**: One Check stands in for a coordinated group effort. The outcome tier describes how the whole group fares.
- **Split Risks**: Two or more characters each roll, and the GM focuses on the most interesting combination of results rather than tracking every detail.

Pick the method that best fits the moment. Use single rolls when you want quick resolution. Use individual rolls when it is important that different characters face different consequences.

### Checks and Clocks

Some obstacles are too big for a single Check. Instead, the GM creates a **Clock** with several segments. Successful Checks tick the Clock forward; failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks.

Use Clocks when:

- Characters are working toward a long-term goal, such as investigating a mystery or repairing a ship.
- A danger is mounting over time, such as a collapsing tunnel, spreading fire, or advancing enemy force.
- Two or more forces are racing toward different outcomes (opposing Clocks).

> **Example – Clock and Checks**
> *Trigger:* The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.
> *Clocks:* "Evacuation Complete" (6 segments) and "Flood Waters Rise" (4 segments).
> *Rolls:* Each scene, characters make MIG, AGI, PRE, or RSN Checks based on their chosen contributions—lifting sandbags, coordinating crowds, analyzing routes. Successes advance the evacuation clock; failures or partials tick the flood clock or create new complications.
> *Outcome:* Which clock fills first determines whether the district is saved, partially saved, or overwhelmed.

### Keeping Momentum

Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt:

- Use Partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action.
- Let Failures create new problems, reveal information, or shift the situation rather than blocking all paths.
- Allow retries only when the circumstances or approach meaningfully change.

The goal is not to punish characters for rolling poorly. The goal is to discover what happens next when risk meets intent. If the table keeps that in view, Checks will feel like natural beats in the story rather than interruptions.

### Chapter Summary

Checks are the core resolution tool: declare intent and approach, assess whether a roll is needed, set DC and modifiers, roll 4d6, and interpret the outcome. Edge and Burden adjust dice rather than targets. Outcome tiers—from Critical Success to Critical Failure—shape consequences with explicit margin ranges (+5 or more, 0 to +4, -1 to -2, -3 to -6, -7 or worse). Strike outcomes have specific mechanical effects: Clear Strikes tick Resolve Clocks by 2, Glancing Strikes by 1 with counterplay, and Misses advance threat Clocks or grant enemy positioning. Use the quick-reference tables during play to keep the action flowing.

## 5. Ways to Play the Game

This game supports multiple styles of play. Some groups meet weekly around a table. Others play online
        in short sessions. Some prefer a single player experience. Others use a shared world without a
        designated Game Master. The system is flexible and does not assume one standard format. The rules in
        later chapters work for all modes of play.

This chapter gives an overview of each play style. It also points to the sections of the book that
        support them. You do not need to choose one style forever. Many groups switch between modes depending on
        who is available or what kind of story they want to tell.

### Group Play With a GM

A group gathers with one person acting as Game Master. The GM presents the world, plays its**characters**,
        and describes the consequences of player actions. The**players control their own characters**and make
        decisions that drive the story forward.

### Duet Play

Duet play involves one player and one GM. It feels more intimate and often focuses on personal stories
        or character driven arcs. Scenes can shift quickly. The pacing is flexible.

### GMless Cooperative Play

In GMless play, the group shares narrative responsibility. No single person controls the world. Instead,
        the table uses procedures that rotate authority and help distribute scene framing, consequences, and
        world building. The game still uses the core resolution system, but each player takes turns providing
        challenges or interpreting outcomes.

### Solo Play

Solo play is designed for a single player. The player controls one or more characters and uses
        structured tools to emulate the world. These tools include prompts, oracles, and scene framing
        procedures. Solo play keeps the core mechanics intact.

### Asynchronous and Play by Post

Asynchronous play occurs through messages, email, shared documents, or online platforms. Players take
        turns responding when they have time. Because asynchronous play lacks immediate conversation, clarity
        is essential. Players describe intent and approach carefully. The GM presents outcomes with enough
        detail to move the story forward between posts.

### One Shot Sessions

A one shot is a complete adventure played in a single session. These sessions help introduce new
        players to the system and work well for conventions or special events. One shots focus on clear stakes
        and strong pacing.

### Campaign Play

A campaign is a longer story told over multiple sessions. Campaigns grow through character development,
        evolving threats, and unfolding consequences. The GM builds on player actions and uses tools like
        Clocks and Tags to maintain continuity.

### Hybrid Styles

Many tables blend modes. Some groups use solo play between sessions to develop character arcs. Others
        rotate GMless scenes inside a GM led campaign. Some begin with a one shot and transition into a long
        form campaign. The system supports these transitions without additional rules.

### Choosing the Right Mode

There is no single correct way to play. Each mode offers a different experience. Choose group play for
        shared storytelling and dynamic character interaction. Choose duet play for intimate stories. Choose
        GMless for collaborative world building. Choose solo play for personal exploration. Choose asynchronous
        play for flexible schedules. Choose one shots for quick adventures. Choose campaigns for deep, evolving
        narratives.

### Chapter Summary

This chapter described the supported modes of play. The system works whether you have one player or six,
        whether you have a GM or distribute authority, and whether you play in person or through messages. The
        next chapter introduces the character framework that supports all of these play styles.

## Style Guide

# Content Style Guide

This guide defines the voice, tone, and structural conventions for all Razorweave content. Writers and editors should reference this document to ensure consistency across all chapters, supplements, and reference materials.

---

## Voice and Tone

### Second Person, Direct Address

Address the reader directly using "you" and "your." This creates an instructive, conversational tone that invites participation.

**Do:**
- "You roll when the GM calls for a Check."
- "Your character begins with a small set of equipment."
- "When you declare an action, you state two things."

**Avoid:**
- "Players roll when the GM calls for a Check."
- "Characters begin with a small set of equipment."
- "When declaring an action, state two things."

### Instructive but Not Prescriptive

Explain how the system works while leaving room for table interpretation. Present mechanics as tools, not mandates.

**Do:**
- "The GM can use conversational order, popcorn order, or initiative rolls depending on the scene."
- "You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths."

**Avoid:**
- "You must use popcorn order for all combat scenes."
- "Never change identity elements after character creation."

### Fiction-First Emphasis

Always ground mechanical explanations in narrative context. Lead with what happens in the story, then explain how the system supports it.

**Do:**
- "Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters."
- "A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain, the stakes matter to the story, and failure would move the scene forward."

**Avoid:**
- "Roll initiative at the start of combat."
- "Make a Check whenever attempting a difficult action."

## Terminology Consistency

Use these terms consistently throughout all content:

| Use This | Not This | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| GM | DM, Referee, Narrator | Game Master is the standard term |
| PC | Hero, Player, Adventurer | Player Character when referring to the character sheet entity |
| Check | Roll, Test, Attempt | The resolution mechanic is always called a Check |
| DC | TN, Target, Difficulty | Difficulty Class is the target number |
| VPC | Major NPC, Boss | Vital Player Character for significant non-player characters |
| Edge | Advantage, Bonus dice | The favorable circumstance modifier |
| Burden | Disadvantage, Penalty dice | The unfavorable circumstance modifier |
| Tag | Marker, Label, Status | Descriptors for environments and situations |
| Condition | Status effect, Debuff | Persistent character states |
| Clock | Progress track, Timer | Segmented trackers for goals and threats |
| Attribute | Stat, Ability score | The four core capabilities (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) |
| Skill | Ability, Talent | Action-based competencies |
| Proficiency | Expertise, Specialty | Domain knowledge and tool familiarity |

---

## Section Structure

### Standard Chapter Flow

Chapters should follow this general structure:

1. **Opening Hook** - A brief paragraph establishing what this chapter covers and why it matters to play
2. **Core Concept** - Clear explanation of the central idea or mechanic
3. **How It Works** - Step-by-step procedural guidance
4. **Examples** - Concrete illustrations using blockquote callouts
5. **GM Guidance** - Tips for running the content at the table (where applicable)
6. **Chapter Summary** - Brief recap of key points (for longer chapters)

### Section Openers

Begin major sections with a grounding statement that connects to the reader's experience or the broader system.

**Good opener:**
> "Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive."

**Weak opener:**
> "This section describes Tags."

### Transitions Between Sections

Use transitional sentences to connect sections and maintain reading flow.

**Example:**
> "The principles in this chapter describe how the table works together. The next chapter expands on these principles by showing how different modes of play shape the experience of the system."

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Active Voice

Prefer active constructions that clearly identify who performs the action.

**Do:**
- "The GM sets a Difficulty Class to represent how hard the task is."
- "Players describe what their characters attempt."

**Avoid:**
- "A Difficulty Class is set to represent task difficulty."
- "What characters attempt is described by players."

### Concise Sentences

Keep sentences focused on a single idea. Break complex explanations into multiple sentences.

**Do:**
> "Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt, use partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action."

**Avoid:**
> "Checks should move the story forward rather than stalling it, which means that when in doubt you should use partial successes to trade progress for cost because this keeps the action moving."

### Concrete Over Abstract

Use specific examples rather than abstract descriptions when explaining concepts.

**Do:**
> "A concept like 'retired scout with a guilty conscience' offers a clearer direction than simply 'fighter.'"

**Avoid:**
> "More specific concepts provide better direction than generic ones."

### Accessible Vocabulary

Write for readers who may be new to tabletop RPGs. Avoid jargon without explanation. Define terms on first use.

---

## Using Examples

### Example Blockquotes

Use blockquote callouts for examples. Format with a bold label followed by the example content.

```markdown
> **Example**
> A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous. The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character's choices matter. The GM calls for a Check.
```

### Example Types

- **Narrative examples** - Short fiction snippets showing the mechanic in play
- **Cross-genre examples** - Demonstrate how the same mechanic works across different settings
- **Counter-examples** - Show what does not trigger a rule or mechanic

### Example Labels

Use descriptive labels when an example illustrates a specific concept:

- `> **Example - When to Roll**`
- `> **Example - Intent and Approach**`
- `> **Example - Cross-Genre Check**`

---

## Writing Conventions

### Numbers

- Spell out numbers one through nine in prose: "choose three items," "roll four dice"
- Use numerals for 10 and above: "a 12-segment Clock," "DC 16"
- Always use numerals for game mechanics: "4d6," "DC 14," "+2 Edge"
- Use numerals in tables and stat blocks

### Lists

Use **numbered lists** for sequential procedures:
> 1. The player declares intent and approach.
> 2. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
> 3. The GM sets DC and notes modifiers.

Use **bulleted lists** for non-sequential items:
> - Environmental Tags
> - Situational Tags
> - Atmospheric Tags

### Emphasis

- Use **bold** for game terms on first significant use in a section
- Use **bold** for defined terms in explanatory text
- Use *italics* for Tag and Condition names: *Dim Light*, *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*
- Use *italics* for emphasis within sentences (sparingly)
- Avoid ALL CAPS for emphasis

### Contractions

Use contractions sparingly. They are acceptable in conversational passages but should be avoided in formal rule explanations.

**Acceptable:**
> "You don't need to memorize the entire book before you play."

**Preferred in rules text:**
> "You do not need to optimize your Skills."

---

## Callout Types

Use blockquote callouts consistently:

### Example Callout
```markdown
> **Example**
> [Example content here]
```

### GM Guidance Callout
```markdown
> **GM Guidance**
> [Advice for running the game]
```

### Note Callout
```markdown
> **Note**
> [Important clarification or reminder]
```

### Warning Callout
```markdown
> **Warning**
> [Caution about common mistakes or edge cases]
```

---

## Chapter Summary Pattern

End longer chapters with a summary section that:
1. Recaps the main concepts covered
2. Connects to upcoming content
3. Reinforces the fiction-first philosophy

**Example:**
> "Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the campaign. By moving from concept to identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, and goals, you build a character who feels grounded and ready for play. Later chapters explain how these elements interact with the core mechanics during sessions."
