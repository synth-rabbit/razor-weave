## 6. Character Creation

Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule before you start. This chapter guides you step by step with all the information you need to complete each stage.

> **New to TTRPGs?**
>
> If this is your first tabletop RPG, welcome! Here's what you need to know:
>
> - You describe what your character tries to do; the GM describes the world's response
> - Dice add uncertainty - you roll when success isn't guaranteed
> - Your character sheet tracks what your character is good at
> - There's no "winning" - the goal is collaborative storytelling
> - You can't break anything - the GM and rules help guide the experience
>
> This chapter walks you through creating a character step by step. Take your time, ask questions, and remember that you can always adjust details as you learn the game.

> **Quick Start: 15-Minute Character Creation**
>
> Need a character fast? This streamlined process gets you playing in six steps. Reference the full steps later for additional depth.
>
> 1. **Concept** - Write one sentence: "A [role/background] who [defining trait or goal]."
> 2. **Attributes** - Assign the standard array: 2 in your primary, 1 in two others, 0 in one.
> 3. **Skills** - Pick 3-4 action verbs your character has practiced (Stealth, Persuasion, Technical Work, etc.).
> 4. **Proficiencies** - Pick 2 areas of knowledge or tool familiarity (Precision Tools, Local History, etc.).
> 5. **Gear** - List 3-4 items that fit your concept (tools, weapons, personal effects).
> 6. **One Connection** - Name one person who matters to your character (mentor, rival, friend, or enemy).
>
> You now have a playable character. Fill in background details and goals as you play. The full nine-step process below adds depth when you have more time.

### Meet Rella: A Complete Character

Before diving into the creation steps, here is a complete character to show what you are building toward. Rella demonstrates how concept, mechanics, and story elements come together into a playable whole. You can reference her sheet as you work through each step.

**Rella — The Technical Specialist**

**Concept:** Former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns.

**Identity Elements:**
- Name: Rella (she/her)
- Origin: Canyon relay settlement
- Profession: Telegraph maintenance and cipher analysis
- Habits: Thinks before speaking, keeps detailed notes, prefers quiet spaces
- Appearance: Practical layered clothing, steady hands, worn tool belt

**Attributes:**
| Attribute | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Might (MIG) | 0 | Physical labor was never her strength |
| Agility (AGI) | 1 | Steady hands and careful movement in tight spaces |
| Presence (PRE) | 1 | Quiet but capable of connecting when needed |
| Reason (RSN) | 2 | Analytical mind, pattern recognition, technical knowledge |

**Skills:** Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, Machinery Handling

**Proficiencies:** Telegraph Instruments, Precision Tools

**Gear:**
- Travel satchel
- Compact communication toolkit
- Notebook filled with cipher fragments
- Insulated lantern

**Background:** Grew up near a canyon relay hub, spent years maintaining communication lines and logging message patterns.

**Relationship:** Isten, a former coworker and mentor. Their friendship ended over a dispute about unsafe repair methods.

**Goals:**
- Short-term: Decode an anomalous pattern she intercepted
- Long-term: Understand where the strange messages originate

**Drive:** Avoid causing harm through her work.

---

Notice how Rella's elements connect: her RSN 2 reflects her analytical nature, her Skills describe actions she performed during years of relay work, her Proficiencies represent the specialized knowledge she accumulated, and her gear supports her technical role. Her background explains where these capabilities came from, her relationship provides story hooks, and her goals give her reasons to take action.

As you work through the steps below, you will see how each decision builds toward a similarly cohesive result.

---

### The Nine-Step Creation Checklist

Character Creation follows nine steps. Each step is self-contained with all the guidance you need to complete it. Work through them in order, checking off each as you finish.

---

#### Step 1: Choose a Concept

**Goal:** Define who your character is in one or two sentences.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Write a short phrase that captures your character's role, background, and defining trait
- [ ] Ensure the concept suggests what scenes you want to be in
- [ ] Verify the concept fits the campaign tone (discuss with your GM if unsure)

**Guidance:**

A concept is the short answer to the question: who is this person? It does not depend on mechanics or require a long backstory. Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for discovery.

| Weak Concept | Strong Concept | Why It Works |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| "Fighter" | "Retired scout with a guilty conscience" | Suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world |
| "Smart person" | "Former telegraph engineer searching for meaning in strange patterns" | Implies profession, habits, and motivation |
| "Healer" | "Field medic who refuses to let anyone die alone" | Shows values, experience, and emotional stakes |

**Questions to help define your concept:**
- What did your character do before the story begins?
- What makes them different from others in a similar role?
- What drives them to take risks?

> **Example**
> A player chooses the concept "former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns." This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours, delicate tools, and unanswered questions.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to describe your character in a single sentence that excites you.

---

#### Step 2: Define Core Identity Elements

**Goal:** Add personal details that make your character feel real.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Choose a name and pronouns
- [ ] Note their origin or home environment
- [ ] Describe their everyday role before the story begins
- [ ] List one or two notable habits or mannerisms
- [ ] Describe how others perceive them at first meeting
- [ ] Identify one or two key experiences that shaped them

**Guidance:**

Identity elements help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at once. Focus on details that connect to your concept.

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Name and pronouns | How others address them | Rella (she/her) |
| Origin | Where they learned to see the world | Canyon relay settlement |
| Former role | What shaped their skills | Telegraph maintenance technician |
| Habits | Behavioral shortcuts for roleplay | Thinks before speaking, keeps detailed notes |
| First impressions | How NPCs initially react | Quiet but competent, overlooked in crowds |
| Formative experiences | Emotional depth and backstory hooks | Years of isolated work, one unexplained message |

You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character.

> **Example**
> The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to describe your character walking into a room and how people react to them.

---

#### Step 3: Assign Attributes

**Goal:** Distribute your character's four core capabilities.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the four Attributes and what each represents
- [ ] Assign the standard array: one at 2, two at 1, one at 0
- [ ] Verify your choices match your concept
- [ ] Note which Attribute is your weakness and consider story opportunities

**Guidance:**

Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character approaches challenges when there is no time to prepare.

| Attribute | Abbreviation | What It Represents |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Might** | MIG | Physical strength, force, raw endurance, carrying capacity |
| **Agility** | AGI | Balance, coordination, stealth, quick reaction, fine motor control |
| **Presence** | PRE | Social force, confidence, emotional expression, leadership, performance |
| **Reason** | RSN | Logic, analysis, memory, structured thinking, technical understanding |

**Standard Starting Array:**
- One Attribute at **2** (your primary strength)
- Two Attributes at **1** (competent areas)
- One Attribute at **0** (your weakness)

No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability with room to grow.

> **Attribute Priorities by Archetype**
>
> Use these common builds as starting points. Adjust based on your specific concept.
>
> ---
>
> **Physical Archetype (MIG Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | MIG | 2 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | RSN | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Warriors, laborers, athletes, enforcers, survivalists
>
> *Secondary options:* AGI for mobile fighters, PRE for intimidating leaders
>
> *Example concepts:* Retired mercenary seeking redemption, dock worker who breaks up fights, traveling blacksmith with a past
>
> ---
>
> **Agile Archetype (AGI Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | AGI | 2 |
> | RSN | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Scouts, thieves, acrobats, sharpshooters, pilots, surgeons
>
> *Secondary options:* RSN for careful planners, PRE for flashy performers
>
> *Example concepts:* Rooftop courier who sees everything, circus performer turned spy, ship's navigator with steady hands
>
> ---
>
> **Social Archetype (PRE Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | PRE | 2 |
> | RSN | 1 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Diplomats, con artists, leaders, performers, investigators, negotiators
>
> *Secondary options:* RSN for manipulative schemers, AGI for charming rogues
>
> *Example concepts:* Ex-courier who knows everyone's secrets, traveling actor gathering intelligence, disgraced noble rebuilding reputation
>
> ---
>
> **Analytical Archetype (RSN Primary)**
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |-----------|-------|
> | RSN | 2 |
> | AGI | 1 |
> | PRE | 1 |
> | MIG | 0 |
>
> *Best for:* Scholars, engineers, doctors, detectives, strategists, researchers
>
> *Secondary options:* AGI for careful craftspeople, PRE for lecturers and teachers
>
> *Example concepts:* Telegraph engineer decoding strange patterns, field archaeologist piecing together lost history, medical examiner who speaks for the dead

> **Example**
> Rella is analytical and steady. Her player chooses Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0. This emphasizes her careful thinking, modest coordination, quiet presence, and relative physical weakness.

**When you finish this step:** Your Attribute spread should reflect what your character is good at and what challenges them.

---

### Skills vs Proficiencies at a Glance

Before selecting Skills and Proficiencies, review this comparison to understand how each works differently in play.

| Aspect | Skills | Proficiencies |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **What It Represents** | Actions you can take | Knowledge and tool familiarity |
| **When You Use It** | When attempting Checks | To justify approaches or gain Edge |
| **Example** | Stealth, Observation | Lockpicking Tools, Local History |
| **How It Helps** | Adds +1 to applicable Checks | Enables approaches or provides Edge |

**The Key Distinction:** Skills describe *doing* while Proficiencies describe *knowing*. A character with the Stealth Skill has practiced moving quietly and adds +1 when making Stealth-related Checks. A character with Lockpicking Tools Proficiency understands how locks work and owns the right equipment. Both matter, but they answer different questions about your character.

---

#### Step 4: Choose Skills

**Goal:** Select 3-4 learned abilities your character can rely on under pressure.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the Suggested Skills table below
- [ ] Select 3-4 Skills that fit your concept and background
- [ ] Consider creating custom Skills with GM approval if needed
- [ ] Ensure Skills support the kinds of scenes you want to experience

> **Understanding Skills**
>
> Skills describe what your character is good at *doing*. When a Skill applies to a Check, you add +1 to your roll result. This +1 represents competent training—the difference between someone who has practiced an action under pressure and someone relying on raw talent alone.
>
> Think of Skills as answering: *What actions has my character practiced?*
>
> When you attempt something related to a Skill you possess, you bring experience and training to bear, adding +1 to your Check. When you attempt something without a relevant Skill, you can still try—you just rely on your Attribute alone without the +1 bonus.

**Guidance:**

Skills are action-based competencies. They describe what your character has done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. When you make a Check, a Skill often shapes your approach.

Skills answer the question: what have you practiced enough to apply under stress?

| Category | Example Skills |
|----------|----------------|
| **Physical** | Athletics, Acrobatics, Climbing, Swimming, Endurance, Brawling |
| **Social** | Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Empathy, Negotiation |
| **Mental** | Investigation, Observation, Analysis, Research, Memory, Deduction |
| **Technical** | Technical Work, Crafting, Machinery, First Aid, Lockpicking, Piloting |
| **Stealth/Survival** | Stealth, Survival, Tracking, Navigation, Foraging |

**Skill Scope Guidelines:**

| Too Broad | Too Narrow | Just Right |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| "Good at everything physical" | "Tying sailor knots" | Athletics |
| "Social expert" | "Lying to guards" | Deception |
| "Technical genius" | "Fixing one brand of telegraph" | Technical Work |

**Custom Skills:** You may create Skills that do not appear on the list. Work with your GM to ensure custom Skills are grounded in the setting, clear in purpose, and neither too broad nor too narrow.

> **Example**
> Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels. When she makes a Check related to any of these Skills, she adds +1 to her result.

**When you finish this step:** You should have 3-4 Skills that describe what your character does well.

---

#### Step 5: Choose Proficiencies

**Goal:** Select 2-3 areas of specialized knowledge or tool familiarity.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review the Suggested Proficiencies table below
- [ ] Select 2-3 Proficiencies that grow from your concept and background
- [ ] Discuss scope with your GM to ensure clarity
- [ ] Consider how Proficiencies change what your character knows automatically

**Guidance:**

Proficiencies represent narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines your character understands deeply. Proficiencies often do not require a roll. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is obvious, or how serious a risk feels.

Proficiencies answer the question: what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly?

| Category | Example Proficiencies |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Tools** | Precision Tools, Medical Instruments, Lockpicks, Climbing Gear, Navigation Equipment |
| **Knowledge** | Local History, Legal Procedures, Arcane Lore, Engineering Principles, Natural Sciences |
| **Social Contexts** | Court Etiquette, Criminal Underworld, Academic Circles, Military Protocol |
| **Environments** | Urban Navigation, Wilderness Survival, Underground Exploration, Maritime Operations |
| **Vehicles/Craft** | Small Watercraft, Ground Vehicles, Aircraft, Mounted Animals |

**How Proficiencies Work:**

Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they provide fictional authority:

| Situation | Without Proficiency | With Proficiency |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Identifying a mechanical fault | Requires a Check (DC 16) | Automatic recognition of common issues |
| Repairing delicate equipment | Check with higher stakes | Check with reduced consequences |
| Understanding technical documents | May not attempt | Can attempt with normal difficulty |
| Noticing environmental hazards | GM describes obviously | Character spots subtle signs |

> **Example**
> Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.

**When you finish this step:** You should have 2-3 Proficiencies that represent your character's specialized expertise.

---

#### Step 6: Determine Starting Gear

**Goal:** Select equipment that fits your background and supports your character's capabilities.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Record the basic gear package (all characters receive this)
- [ ] Choose up to three concept-driven items
- [ ] Select one weapon or dangerous tool if appropriate to the campaign
- [ ] Consider one custom item with GM approval if desired

**Guidance:**

Gear provides fictional authority, not numerical bonuses. It represents what your character already knows how to use and what situations they are prepared for.

**Basic Gear Package (all characters):**
- Clothing suited to their environment
- A backpack or satchel
- Basic travel supplies
- A personal item that holds meaning

**Concept-Driven Items (choose up to 3):**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Technical Tools** | Toolkit, precision instruments, repair kit, measuring devices |
| **Recording/Reference** | Field journal, reference notes, analysis cards, maps |
| **Navigation/Survival** | Compass, signal mirror, reliable lantern, rope and spikes |
| **Medical/Care** | Medical pouch, first aid supplies, herbal remedies |
| **Social/Performance** | Musical instrument, fine clothing, forged papers, contact list |
| **Combat (if appropriate)** | Pocket knife, baton, bow with arrows, simple sidearm |

**Gear as Fictional Authority:**

| If You Have the Right Gear | The GM May... |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Tools for the job | Lower the DC of related Checks |
| Equipment that fits the situation | Remove uncertainty for routine tasks |
| Specialized items | Provide access to approaches others cannot attempt |

| If You Lack Appropriate Gear | The GM May... |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| No tools available | Increase DC by one tier (e.g., DC 14 to DC 16) |
| Improvised equipment | Introduce complications on partial success |
| Wrong tools entirely | Require creative fictional justification |

> **Example**
> Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work.

**When you finish this step:** You should have a gear list that supports your character's role and feels personal.

---

#### Step 7: Establish Background and Relationships

**Goal:** Define where your character comes from and who matters to them.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Write 2-3 sentences about where you grew up and what shaped you
- [ ] Note what kind of work or role you had before the story begins
- [ ] Name at least one meaningful relationship (mentor, rival, family, friend, or enemy)
- [ ] Leave space for new relationships to emerge in play

**Guidance:**

Background provides context for your character's abilities and perspectives. Relationships give the GM material for scenes, challenges, and future story arcs.

**Background Questions:**
- Where did you grow up?
- What pressures shaped your early life?
- What was your everyday role before the story began?
- Why did you leave that life (or why are you still in it)?

**Relationship Types:**

| Type | Story Potential |
|------|-----------------|
| **Mentor** | Source of wisdom, possible debt or expectation |
| **Rival** | Competition, tension, grudging respect |
| **Family** | Obligations, love, complicated history |
| **Friend** | Support, shared history, someone to protect |
| **Enemy** | Danger, unfinished business, source of conflict |
| **Colleague** | Professional respect, shared knowledge, potential ally |

You do not need to define every relationship up front. Name one or two that feel important now. Add others as they emerge in play.

> **Example**
> Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. She names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing. Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods.

**When you finish this step:** You should have a sense of your character's past and at least one named NPC who matters to them.

---

#### Step 8: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads

**Goal:** Establish what motivates your character and what unresolved elements create story potential.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Define at least one short-term goal (achievable within a few sessions)
- [ ] Define at least one long-term goal (campaign-spanning aspiration)
- [ ] Identify a core drive (deeper motivation or fear)
- [ ] Note one or two personal threads (unresolved questions or tensions)

**Guidance:**

Goals and drives explain why your character keeps moving. Personal threads give the GM material to weave into future scenes.

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Short-term goal** | Concrete, achievable objective | "Decode the anomalous pattern I intercepted" |
| **Long-term goal** | Major aspiration that shapes the campaign | "Understand where the strange messages originate" |
| **Drive** | Underlying motivation or fear | "Avoid causing harm through my work" |
| **Personal thread** | Unresolved question or tension | "The mysterious origin of the pattern—who sent it?" |

**Goal Strength Check:**

| Strong Goal | Weak Goal |
|-------------|-----------|
| Specific and measurable | Vague or abstract |
| Connected to your concept | Disconnected from character |
| Creates story opportunities | Ends story or removes tension |
| Involves other characters | Achievable alone without conflict |

> **Example**
> Rella has a goal to decode an anomalous pattern she once intercepted and a drive to avoid causing harm through her work. A personal thread involves the mysterious origin of the pattern and who might have sent it.

**When you finish this step:** You should be able to explain what your character wants and why they are willing to take risks to get it.

---

#### Step 9: Final Review and Campaign Fit

**Goal:** Ensure your character works as a cohesive whole and fits the group.

**What to do:**
- [ ] Review all previous steps for internal consistency
- [ ] Verify concept, identity, mechanics, and story elements align
- [ ] Discuss with GM and other players how your character connects to the group
- [ ] Adjust details to create natural connections and complementary capabilities
- [ ] Confirm your character is ready for play

**Guidance:**

A complete character should feel like a coherent person. All the elements—concept, identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, and goals—should support each other.

**Internal Consistency Check:**

| Question | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| Does the concept match the mechanics? | High RSN for analytical characters, high MIG for physical ones |
| Do Skills reflect the background? | A former soldier should have combat or survival Skills |
| Does gear fit the profession? | Technical characters carry tools; social characters carry props |
| Do goals create story momentum? | Goals should lead to action, not avoid it |

**Group Integration Questions:**
- Why would your character travel or work with this group?
- What shared history or complementary goals connect you?
- What tensions exist that create interesting roleplay?
- What gaps in group capability does your character fill?

**When you finish this step:** Your character sheet is complete and you are ready to play.

### Worked Examples

This section presents two complete character builds with annotated decision-making at each step. These examples show different archetypes and explain the reasoning behind each choice.

---

#### Worked Example 1: Kira Valdros — Combat-Focused Character (MIG/AGI)

**Final Concept:** Former military scout turned bounty hunter who uses precision and overwhelming force.

---

**Step 1: Choosing the Concept**

*The player wants a combat-effective character who can hold their own in dangerous situations. They consider several options:*

| Option Considered | Rejected Because | Selected Because |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| "Fighter" | Too generic—no personality or history | — |
| "Retired soldier" | Common trope, needs more specificity | — |
| "Military scout turned bounty hunter" | — | Suggests combat training, tracking skills, and motivation to take dangerous jobs |

*Decision: "Former military scout turned bounty hunter" provides clear combat capability (military training), useful non-combat skills (scouting, tracking), and built-in story hooks (why did they leave the military? what do they hunt?)*

**Final Concept:** Former military scout turned bounty hunter who uses precision and overwhelming force.

---

**Step 2: Defining Identity Elements**

*The player builds on the concept to create specific details:*

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Name** | Kira Valdros (she/her) | Strong name that sounds capable; pronouns established |
| **Origin** | Border fortress settlement | Military backgrounds often come from frontier areas; suggests tough upbringing |
| **Former Role** | Scout and forward observer for garrison force | Explains both combat and reconnaissance skills |
| **Habits** | Checks exits when entering rooms; sleeps light; prefers high ground | Military training creates lasting behavioral patterns |
| **First Impression** | Alert, dangerous, professional | Bounty hunters project competence to attract clients |
| **Key Experience** | A mission went wrong, civilians died, she left the service | Creates guilt, motivation for bounty work (making amends), and emotional depth |

**Identity Summary:**
- Name: Kira Valdros (she/her)
- Origin: Border fortress settlement
- Profession: Former military scout, current bounty hunter
- Habits: Checks exits, sleeps light, prefers high ground
- Appearance: Athletic build, practical clothing, several visible scars, always armed
- Formative experience: Left military after a mission resulted in civilian casualties

---

**Step 3: Assigning Attributes**

*The player wants combat effectiveness. They review the archetypes:*

| Archetype | Fit Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Physical (MIG primary) | Strong fit—military training emphasizes physical capability |
| Agile (AGI primary) | Also strong fit—scouts need stealth and quick reactions |

*Decision: MIG primary with AGI secondary. This creates a character who can hit hard and move well, fitting the "precision and overwhelming force" concept.*

| Attribute | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **MIG** | 2 | Primary. Years of physical training; carries heavy gear; overpowers targets when needed |
| **AGI** | 1 | Secondary. Scout training requires quick movement; combat reflexes from experience |
| **PRE** | 1 | Tertiary. Enough social capability to negotiate with clients and intimidate targets |
| **RSN** | 0 | Weakness. Acts on instinct rather than careful analysis; relies on training over thinking |

*This spread means Kira excels at physical confrontation, handles agile maneuvers adequately, can manage social situations when needed, and struggles with puzzles or careful planning.*

---

**Step 4: Choosing Skills**

*The player needs Skills that support both combat and the bounty hunting profession:*

| Skill Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Brawling | Yes | Direct combat capability; fits military training |
| Athletics | Yes | Running, climbing, general physical actions; essential for chases |
| Tracking | Yes | Finding targets is core to bounty hunting |
| Intimidation | Yes | Useful for both combat (causing enemies to surrender) and negotiation (pressuring informants) |
| Stealth | Rejected | Would be useful, but player prioritizes direct action over sneaking |
| Observation | Rejected | Covered partially by Tracking; RSN 0 makes mental Skills less effective |

**Skills Selected:** Brawling, Athletics, Tracking, Intimidation

> **Why These Skills?**
>
> Kira chose **Brawling** and **Athletics** because her backstory as a military scout means she spent years training for physical confrontation and demanding field operations. These are *actions she performed repeatedly* during her service. When she makes Checks involving these actions, she adds +1 to her result.
>
> She took **Tracking** because finding people is what bounty hunters *do*—it is an action central to her current profession.
>
> **Intimidation** rounds out her Skills because projecting danger and convincing targets to surrender is an *action* that serves both combat and investigation scenes.
>
> Note that she did *not* take Stealth, even though scouts often move quietly. The player decided Kira's approach is more direct—she tracks targets down and confronts them rather than sneaking past obstacles. This is a character choice, not a mechanical requirement.

*These Skills create a character who excels at physical confrontation and pursuit, with social intimidation as a backup approach.*

---

**Step 5: Choosing Proficiencies**

*The player needs Proficiencies that reflect military background and bounty hunting work:*

| Proficiency Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Military Protocol | Yes | Understanding military structures helps when dealing with guards, soldiers, former comrades |
| Weapons Maintenance | Yes | A bounty hunter's equipment must be reliable; prevents gear failures |
| Wilderness Survival | Rejected | Useful but not central to the character concept |
| Criminal Underworld | Yes | Bounty hunters work adjacent to criminals; understanding this world helps find targets |

**Proficiencies Selected:** Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Criminal Underworld

> **Why These Proficiencies?**
>
> Kira took **Military Protocol** because it represents *knowledge* she absorbed during years of service—understanding ranks, procedures, and how military organizations operate. This is not an action she performs; it is context she carries that changes how she interacts with soldiers and guards.
>
> **Weapons Maintenance** is a Proficiency rather than a Skill because it represents *familiarity with tools*—knowing how to clean, repair, and maintain her equipment. She does not roll to maintain her sword; she simply knows how because of this Proficiency.
>
> **Criminal Underworld** represents *knowledge of a social context*. She understands how criminal networks operate, who to ask, and what language to use. This knowledge enables approaches (like finding black market informants) that would be impossible without it.
>
> Compare these to her Skills: Tracking is an *action* she performs (following trails, reading signs). Criminal Underworld is *knowledge* that tells her where to start tracking in the first place.

*These Proficiencies mean Kira automatically understands military ranks and procedures, keeps her equipment in working order without Checks, and knows how to navigate the criminal elements of society.*

---

**Step 6: Determining Starting Gear**

*The player selects gear that supports a combat-ready bounty hunter:*

**Basic Package:**
- Practical travel clothing (sturdy, weather-resistant)
- Military-style pack (organized, durable)
- Basic travel supplies
- Personal item: Dog tags from her unit (reminder of who she was)

**Concept-Driven Items (3):**

| Item | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Reliable sword | Primary weapon; fits setting and military background |
| Reinforced leather armor | Protection without sacrificing mobility |
| Restraints and rope | Bounty hunters need to capture targets, not just fight them |

**Weapon:**
- Sword (already counted above)

**Gear List:**
- Sturdy travel clothing
- Military pack
- Basic supplies
- Dog tags (personal item)
- Reliable sword
- Reinforced leather armor
- Restraints and rope

---

**Step 7: Establishing Background and Relationships**

**Background:**
*Kira grew up in a border settlement where military service was expected. She joined young, showed aptitude for scouting, and spent years on the frontier. A reconnaissance mission went wrong when she reported an enemy position that turned out to be a refugee camp. The garrison acted on her intelligence. She left the service after that, unable to reconcile her role in what happened.*

**Relationship:**

| NPC | Relationship | Story Potential |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Sergeant Marro | Former commanding officer | Still in the military; represents the life Kira left; possible source of contracts or conflict |

*The player leaves room for additional relationships to emerge—targets who become complicated, clients with hidden agendas, other bounty hunters.*

---

**Step 8: Defining Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads**

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Short-term goal** | Complete current contract cleanly | Establishes immediate stakes for early sessions |
| **Long-term goal** | Find a way to make amends for the refugee camp incident | Provides campaign-spanning motivation and emotional weight |
| **Drive** | Prove that her skills can protect instead of harm | Connects to backstory; explains why she takes certain jobs |
| **Personal thread** | Some of the refugees survived—where are they now? | Unresolved question the GM can use |

---

**Step 9: Final Review**

**Consistency Check:**
- Concept (military scout turned bounty hunter) matches MIG/AGI build
- Skills (Brawling, Athletics, Tracking, Intimidation) support combat and pursuit
- Proficiencies (Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Criminal Underworld) reflect background
- Gear (sword, armor, restraints) fits profession
- Goals connect to backstory tragedy

**Complete Character Sheet:**

**Kira Valdros**
- **Concept:** Former military scout turned bounty hunter who uses precision and overwhelming force
- **Attributes:** MIG 2, AGI 1, PRE 1, RSN 0
- **Skills:** Brawling, Athletics, Tracking, Intimidation
- **Proficiencies:** Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Criminal Underworld
- **Gear:** Sturdy travel clothing, military pack, sword, reinforced leather armor, restraints and rope, dog tags
- **Background:** Border fortress settlement; left military after reconnaissance error led to civilian casualties
- **Relationship:** Sergeant Marro (former CO)
- **Goals:** Complete contracts cleanly (short-term); make amends for past mistakes (long-term)
- **Drive:** Prove her skills can protect instead of harm
- **Thread:** Where are the survivors of the refugee camp?

---

#### Worked Example 2: Delian Osk — Social/Investigative Character (PRE/RSN)

**Final Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden.

---

**Step 1: Choosing the Concept**

*The player wants a character focused on investigation and social manipulation rather than combat. They consider several options:*

| Option Considered | Rejected Because | Selected Because |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| "Detective" | Generic; needs more texture | — |
| "Con artist" | Fun but lacks investigative focus | — |
| "Journalist" | Good but player wants seedier angle | — |
| "Insurance investigator" | — | Combines investigation (finding fraud) with social skills (interviewing) and built-in moral ambiguity |

*Decision: "Disgraced insurance investigator" adds the "disgraced" element for story hooks—why were they disgraced? What did they do? This creates a character who knows how systems work but operates outside them now.*

**Final Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden.

---

**Step 2: Defining Identity Elements**

*The player develops specific details that support an investigative, socially adept character:*

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Name** | Delian Osk (they/them) | Slightly formal name fits professional background; gender-neutral presentation suits someone who observes rather than stands out |
| **Origin** | Major commercial city | Insurance work happens in urban centers; explains understanding of business and bureaucracy |
| **Former Role** | Senior fraud investigator for major insurance firm | Specific title suggests expertise and authority |
| **Habits** | Takes notes constantly; asks questions that seem casual but are not; never sits with back to door | Professional habits from years of investigation |
| **First Impression** | Forgettable until they start talking; then uncomfortably perceptive | Investigators benefit from being underestimated |
| **Key Experience** | Uncovered fraud that implicated powerful people; was discredited and fired rather than allowed to publish findings | Explains "disgraced" element and creates enemies |

**Identity Summary:**
- Name: Delian Osk (they/them)
- Origin: Major commercial city
- Profession: Former senior fraud investigator, current freelance investigator
- Habits: Constant note-taking, probing questions, situational awareness
- Appearance: Unremarkable clothing, plain face, sharp eyes, always has a notebook
- Formative experience: Discovered fraud reaching highest levels; silenced and discredited

---

**Step 3: Assigning Attributes**

*The player reviews archetypes for investigation/social focus:*

| Archetype | Fit Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Social (PRE primary) | Strong fit—investigation requires interviewing, persuading, reading people |
| Analytical (RSN primary) | Also strong fit—investigation requires analysis, deduction, connecting evidence |

*Decision: PRE primary with RSN secondary. The player decides Delian succeeds more through reading people and social manipulation than pure analysis. They get information from people, not just documents.*

| Attribute | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **PRE** | 2 | Primary. Interviews are their main tool; reading people, persuading witnesses, blending in socially |
| **RSN** | 1 | Secondary. Still capable of analysis and deduction; just not their leading strength |
| **AGI** | 1 | Tertiary. Enough coordination to handle basic physical tasks; can run if needed |
| **MIG** | 0 | Weakness. Avoids physical confrontation entirely; relies on wit over strength |

*This spread means Delian excels at social interaction and manipulation, handles analytical work adequately, can manage basic physical situations, and must avoid or talk their way out of fights.*

---

**Step 4: Choosing Skills**

*The player needs Skills that support investigation and social manipulation:*

| Skill Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Investigation | Yes | Core to concept; finding hidden information |
| Persuasion | Yes | Getting people to talk, share information, cooperate |
| Deception | Yes | Sometimes investigation requires pretending to be someone else |
| Observation | Yes | Noticing details others miss; reading body language |
| Empathy | Rejected | Covered somewhat by Observation; Persuasion handles social connection |
| Research | Rejected | Would be useful but RSN is secondary; prioritize PRE-based Skills |

**Skills Selected:** Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation

> **Why These Skills?**
>
> Delian chose **Investigation** because it is the core *action* of their profession—searching rooms, examining documents, following leads. This is something they *do* actively. When investigating, they add +1 to their Check result.
>
> **Persuasion** and **Deception** are both *actions* Delian performs regularly: convincing witnesses to share information, talking their way past gatekeepers, adopting false identities to access restricted areas. These are practiced behaviors, not just knowledge, and each adds +1 when applicable.
>
> **Observation** rounds out the set because noticing details—reading body language, spotting inconsistencies, catching lies—is an *action* that supports everything else they do.
>
> Note that Delian did *not* take Research as a Skill, even though investigators often review documents. The player decided Delian gets information primarily through *people* rather than archives. Their RSN of 1 can handle basic document review without a dedicated Skill.

*These Skills create a character who excels at finding and extracting information through social means.*

---

**Step 5: Choosing Proficiencies**

*The player needs Proficiencies that reflect the investigator background:*

| Proficiency Considered | Selected? | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Legal Procedures | Yes | Investigators need to understand how official systems work |
| Commercial Operations | Yes | Insurance fraud requires understanding business; useful for many investigations |
| Academic Circles | Rejected | Not central to the character's background |
| Urban Navigation | Yes | Investigators work in cities; knowing how to find people and places matters |

**Proficiencies Selected:** Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation

> **Why These Proficiencies?**
>
> Delian took **Legal Procedures** because it represents *knowledge* of how courts, contracts, and official processes work. They do not roll to understand a legal document—they simply know what it means because of years working adjacent to the legal system.
>
> **Commercial Operations** is similarly *knowledge*-based: understanding how businesses structure finances, where fraud typically hides, what documents matter. This Proficiency does not make Delian better at Checks; it tells them *where to look* and *what questions to ask*.
>
> **Urban Navigation** represents *environmental familiarity*—knowing how cities are laid out, which neighborhoods serve which purposes, how to find someone who does not want to be found. This Proficiency might grant Edge when tracking someone through the city, or it might simply let Delian attempt approaches (like using back alleys and service corridors) that others would not think of.
>
> Compare to Skills: Investigation is the *action* of searching and examining. Legal Procedures is the *knowledge* that tells Delian what they are looking at and why it matters.

*These Proficiencies mean Delian automatically understands court processes and legal documents, knows how businesses operate and where fraud hides, and can navigate urban environments efficiently.*

---

**Step 6: Determining Starting Gear**

*The player selects gear that supports an investigator who works through social means:*

**Basic Package:**
- Professional but unremarkable clothing (blends into business settings)
- Leather satchel (holds documents and notebooks)
- Basic travel supplies
- Personal item: A letter of commendation from their former employer (reminder of what they lost)

**Concept-Driven Items (3):**

| Item | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Multiple notebooks and writing supplies | Constant note-taking is central to their method |
| Set of forged credentials | Sometimes investigation requires being someone else |
| Contact list and reference documents | Years of work built a network; this represents that knowledge |

**Weapon:**
- Small concealed knife (for emergencies only; Delian avoids violence)

**Gear List:**
- Professional clothing
- Leather satchel
- Basic supplies
- Letter of commendation (personal item)
- Notebooks and writing supplies
- Forged credentials
- Contact list and reference documents
- Small concealed knife

---

**Step 7: Establishing Background and Relationships**

**Background:**
*Delian spent fifteen years as a fraud investigator for one of the largest insurance firms in the city. They were good—too good. When they uncovered a fraud scheme that implicated several council members and a noble family, they reported it through proper channels. The investigation was buried. Delian was accused of fabricating evidence, fired publicly, and blacklisted from legitimate work. Now they take private cases, operating in the space between legal and illegal, trying to do the work that matters while surviving on the margins.*

**Relationship:**

| NPC | Relationship | Story Potential |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Councilor Veth | Enemy | One of the people Delian tried to expose; still in power; would benefit from Delian's permanent silence |
| Marek, newspaper editor | Former ally | Believed Delian's evidence but could not publish; feels guilty; might help if approached carefully |

*Two relationships provide both threat (Veth) and potential support (Marek).*

---

**Step 8: Defining Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads**

| Element | Choice | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Short-term goal** | Build reputation as a reliable private investigator | Establishes immediate economic pressure and motivation to take cases |
| **Long-term goal** | Expose the people who destroyed their career | Campaign-spanning goal that connects to backstory |
| **Drive** | The truth matters more than comfort or safety | Explains why they keep investigating despite the cost |
| **Personal thread** | What happened to the evidence they gathered? Someone must still have it | Unresolved question the GM can use |

---

**Step 9: Final Review**

**Consistency Check:**
- Concept (disgraced investigator) matches PRE/RSN build
- Skills (Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation) support social investigation
- Proficiencies (Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation) reflect background
- Gear (notebooks, credentials, contacts) fits profession
- Goals connect to backstory injustice

**Complete Character Sheet:**

**Delian Osk**
- **Concept:** Disgraced insurance investigator who specializes in finding what people want hidden
- **Attributes:** PRE 2, RSN 1, AGI 1, MIG 0
- **Skills:** Investigation, Persuasion, Deception, Observation
- **Proficiencies:** Legal Procedures, Commercial Operations, Urban Navigation
- **Gear:** Professional clothing, leather satchel, notebooks and writing supplies, forged credentials, contact list, small concealed knife, letter of commendation
- **Background:** Former senior fraud investigator; discredited after uncovering high-level corruption
- **Relationships:** Councilor Veth (enemy who silenced them); Marek the editor (guilty former ally)
- **Goals:** Build reputation as private investigator (short-term); expose those who destroyed their career (long-term)
- **Drive:** The truth matters more than comfort or safety
- **Thread:** Where is the original evidence they gathered?

### Reference Character Summaries

This section presents two additional character summaries for reference. These show final results without step-by-step annotation.

---

#### Reviewing Rella's Build

At the beginning of this chapter, you met Rella—a complete character sheet showing what the creation process produces. Now that you have worked through the nine steps, you can see how her concept informed every choice.

Rella's concept as a "former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns" drove each decision:

**Attributes:** Her RSN 2 reflects the analytical mind required for pattern recognition and technical work. AGI 1 represents the steady hands needed for delicate instrument repair. PRE 1 allows her to connect with others when needed, though she prefers quiet. MIG 0 acknowledges that physical labor was never her focus.

**Skills:** Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling are all *actions* she performed repeatedly during years of relay maintenance—watching for signal anomalies, moving quietly through narrow maintenance tunnels, repairing delicate equipment, and handling complex machinery.

**Proficiencies:** Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools represent *knowledge* she accumulated through her work—understanding how communication devices function internally, and familiarity with the specialized tools required to maintain them.

**Gear:** Her compact communication toolkit, cipher notebook, and insulated lantern all support her technical role and suggest how she spends her time.

**Background and Relationships:** Growing up near a relay hub explains her exposure to communication technology. Her relationship with Isten provides both history (a mentor who taught her) and tension (their falling out over unsafe methods).

**Goals and Drive:** Her desire to decode the anomalous pattern creates immediate story momentum. Her drive to avoid causing harm through her work adds emotional depth and guides her decisions.

When building your own character, trace these same connections. Ask: does each element grow naturally from my concept? If something feels disconnected, consider whether the element or the concept needs adjustment.

---

#### Varn — The Social Operator

**Concept:** Charming ex-courier who knows everyone's secrets but trusts no one.

**Identity Elements:**
- Name: Varn (he/him)
- Origin: Port city trading hub
- Profession: Message courier, information broker
- Habits: Always watching exits, collects favors, speaks in half-truths
- Appearance: Well-dressed but practical, easy smile, constantly moving

**Attributes:**
| Attribute | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Might (MIG) | 0 | Avoids physical confrontation |
| Agility (AGI) | 1 | Quick reflexes from years of navigating crowds |
| Presence (PRE) | 2 | Natural charisma, skilled at reading people |
| Reason (RSN) | 1 | Good memory for names, faces, and debts |

**Skills:** Persuasion, Deception, Empathy, Navigation

**Proficiencies:** Criminal Underworld, Urban Navigation, Court Etiquette

**Gear:**
- Fine traveling clothes
- Hidden coin purse
- Forged identity papers
- Small journal of contacts

**Background:** Started as a legitimate courier, gradually shifted to carrying sensitive information for those who paid well. Knows the port's social networks intimately.

**Relationship:** Mira, a dock authority official who owes Varn a significant favor—and hates that fact.

**Goals:**
- Short-term: Clear a debt to a dangerous crime boss
- Long-term: Establish a legitimate business and leave the shadows behind

**Drive:** Never be powerless or trapped again.

---

#### Kessa — The Combat Veteran

**Concept:** Retired mercenary seeking redemption through protecting the vulnerable.

**Identity Elements:**
- Name: Kessa (she/they)
- Origin: Border fortress town
- Profession: Former mercenary captain
- Habits: Wakes early, checks perimeter, speaks bluntly
- Appearance: Scarred, muscular, practical armor, short-cropped hair

**Attributes:**
| Attribute | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Might (MIG) | 2 | Years of combat training and physical conditioning |
| Agility (AGI) | 1 | Combat reflexes, good spatial awareness |
| Presence (PRE) | 1 | Natural authority from leadership experience |
| Reason (RSN) | 0 | Acts on instinct rather than careful analysis |

**Skills:** Brawling, Intimidation, Athletics, Endurance

**Proficiencies:** Military Protocol, Weapons Maintenance, Battlefield Medicine

**Gear:**
- Worn but reliable sword
- Reinforced traveling armor
- Field medical kit
- Mercenary company badge (retired)

**Background:** Led a small mercenary company for a decade. Left after a contract went wrong and civilians suffered. Now travels seeking ways to atone.

**Relationship:** Sergeant Doss, a former subordinate who still sends letters. The only person from that life Kessa still trusts.

**Goals:**
- Short-term: Find work protecting a caravan or settlement
- Long-term: Build something worth protecting instead of destroying

**Drive:** Prove that strength can serve instead of harm.

---

### Chapter Summary

Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the campaign. The nine-step checklist guides you from initial concept through identity elements, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, goals, and final review. Each step is self-contained with the guidance you need to complete it.

The Skills vs Proficiencies comparison table clarifies the distinction between action-based competencies and knowledge-based expertise—a common point of confusion for new players. Skills describe what you *do* and add +1 to applicable Checks; Proficiencies describe what you *know* and enable approaches or provide Edge.

The Attribute Priorities sidebar helps you select mechanical foundations that match common character archetypes. The worked examples demonstrate decision-making throughout the process, showing not just what to choose but *why* each choice serves the character concept—particularly for Skills and Proficiencies, where the annotations explain the reasoning behind each selection.

By completing all nine steps, you build a character who feels grounded, mechanically capable, and ready for play. Your character sheet represents a person with history, motivation, and room to grow as the campaign unfolds.

> **First Session Tips**
>
> - Don't worry about knowing all the rules - the GM will guide you
> - Ask questions whenever you're unsure
> - Describe what your character does, not what game mechanic you want to use
> - It's okay to fail - failure creates interesting stories
>
> Remember: everyone at the table wants you to succeed and have fun. Your first session is about learning the rhythm of play, not mastering every rule.

## 7. Characters and Attributes

This chapter deepens the character framework introduced in Character Creation. It explains how
        Attributes define what your character is naturally good at, how those ratings interact with intent and
        approach, and how to think about Attribute growth over time. Skills and Proficiencies add texture and
        specialization. Attributes provide the core pillars those details rest on.

### Attributes Overview

Every character has four Attributes:

- **Might (MIG)**– Physical power, endurance, and resilience.
- **Agility (AGI)**– Speed, precision, balance, and reflexes.
- **Presence (PRE)**– Charisma, willpower, and social influence.
- **Reason (RSN)**– Logic, perception, memory, and analytical thinking.

Attribute ratings are small numbers that reflect how strongly each pillar shows up in play. During
        Character Creation, you assign a starting spread (usually 2, 1, 1, 0) across MIG, AGI, PRE, and RSN.
        Those ratings are then added to relevant checks throughout the campaign.

Attributes are always interpreted through the fiction. A high MIG character does not simply "have +2."
        They push through heavy doors, endure long marches, and soak physical hardship more easily. A high RSN
        character spots patterns, recalls obscure details, and notices when something does not fit.

### Attribute Ratings and What They Mean

Attribute ratings are intentionally compact. Most characters begin with values between 0 and 2. This
        keeps the focus on intent, approach, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and the `4d6` dice
        results instead of on large numerical bonuses.

As a general guideline:

- **0**– Unremarkable. You can attempt normal tasks with no special edge or penalty.
- **1**– Competent. You are noticeably capable in this area compared to an average person.
- **2**– Exceptional. You stand out in most situations that rely on this Attribute.

When you make a Check, you roll**4d6**, sum the dice, and add your Attribute rating (and
        any other bonuses or penalties). You compare that total against a Difficulty Class (DC) from the
        standard ladder (typically DC 12–22). The difference between your total and the DC is the margin, which
        determines the outcome tier. A higher Attribute nudges those margins upward without guaranteeing any
        particular result.

#### Why the 0–2 Scale Matters

The bounded Attribute scale is an intentional design choice, not a limitation. By keeping numbers small, Razorweave ensures that every point represents a significant capability difference while maintaining focus on the story rather than arithmetic. If you are coming from video games or other tabletop systems with larger stat ranges, understand that this compression is a feature: it prevents characters from becoming numerically invincible and keeps even high-Attribute characters engaged with the fiction.

Each point on the scale meaningfully shifts your probability of success. Consider a Routine Check against DC 14:

| Attribute | Approximate Success Rate | What It Feels Like |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| +0 | ~38% | You succeed when luck favors you. Stakes feel real. |
| +1 | ~50% | Coin-flip odds. You are competent but not dominant. |
| +2 | ~62% | You succeed more often than not. Expertise shows. |

These probabilities shift further with Edge, Burden, and other modifiers—but the baseline tells an important story. A +2 Attribute does not guarantee success. It provides a meaningful edge while leaving room for tension, surprise, and the consequences that drive narrative forward. The dice remain the primary variable, and your choices about intent, approach, and positioning matter more than raw numbers.

> **Note**
> If you are accustomed to systems where a high stat trivializes challenges, Razorweave will feel different. Here, even your strongest Attribute invites drama. A character with MIG 2 is exceptionally strong—and will still occasionally struggle with that heavy door. This is not a flaw. It is where stories happen.

### Choosing Your Starting Spread

During Character Creation, you assign a small array of values across your four Attributes. The default
        array is:

- One Attribute at**2**
- Two Attributes at**1**
- One Attribute at**0**

This spread creates characters who are competent across several areas with a clear primary strength and
        one relative weakness. You can think of this as your character's natural "starting shape" before Skills,
        Proficiencies, Tags, and gear are layered on.

A useful way to choose your spread is to ask three questions:

- Which Attribute describes how you most often solve problems when under pressure?
- Which Attribute fits your concept but should remain a supporting strength rather than your main focus?
- Which Attribute would be interesting to struggle with?

Answering these questions usually reveals where to place your 2, your two 1s, and your 0. You are not
        optimizing a build—you are deciding what kind of situations will feel natural, challenging, or risky for
        this character.

### Attributes and Archetypes

Different spreads suggest different kinds of characters. The table below offers a few example archetypes.
        You do not need to use these labels at the table—they are here to help you think about possibilities.

Example Attribute Spreads and Archetypes

| Spread                     | Example Archetype         | Notes                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MIG 2, AGI 1, PRE 1, RSN 0 | Front-line problem solver | Leads with physical action and presence; relies on others for deep analysis.      |
| MIG 0, AGI 2, PRE 1, RSN 1 | Scout or infiltrator      | Excels at movement and precision; must negotiate around brute-force obstacles.    |
| MIG 1, AGI 0, PRE 2, RSN 1 | Negotiator or leader      | Strong in social scenes; needs help when delicate physical work is required.      |
| MIG 1, AGI 1, PRE 0, RSN 2 | Analyst or investigator   | Solves problems through observation and planning; may struggle to command a room. |

Use these examples as prompts, not prescriptions. You can apply any spread to any concept. A physically
        powerful scholar or a socially adept scout can be just as compelling as the "expected" combinations.

### Attributes, Intent, and Approach

Attributes are chosen based on*how*your character attempts something, not on what they would
        like to roll. The GM listens to your intent (what you are trying to achieve) and your approach (how you
        attempt it), then chooses the Attribute that best matches that description.

The same fictional goal can be resolved with different Attributes depending on approach:

- Prying open a stuck hatch with brute force might call for**MIG**.
- Picking the lock or working delicate mechanisms might call for**AGI**.
- Coaxing someone on the other side to open it might call for**PRE**.
- Analyzing the structure to find a weak point might call for**RSN**.

This flexibility keeps Attributes tied to the story. You do not choose an Attribute from a menu. You
        describe what your character does. The Attribute follows naturally from that description.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Calling for an Attribute**When a player describes intent and approach, repeat back what you heard in your own words, then say
>         which Attribute you think applies and why. If the table disagrees, adjust together. The goal is shared
>         understanding, not surprise rulings. If two Attributes seem equally valid, choose the one that fits the
>         character's established habits, or offer the player a choice with different risks attached.

### Working with Low Attributes

A rating of 0 is not a punishment. It means your character does not naturally lean on that Attribute
        when things get tense. The game expects you to have at least one area where you are merely ordinary.

Low Attributes shape the story in interesting ways:

- A low MIG character might avoid direct contests of strength and instead look for tools, allies, or alternate routes.
- A low AGI character might favor careful planning over risky stunts.
- A low PRE character might rely on written communication, intermediaries, or quiet influence.
- A low RSN character might lean on intuition, experience, or other party members for analysis.

Play your weaknesses honestly and creatively. They provide hooks for growth, tension, and teamwork.
        When a situation hinges on your low Attribute, it does not mean you should stay silent. It means the
        stakes are higher, and failure may reveal something important about who you are.

#### Embodying Limitations as Character Identity

A low Attribute is not merely a mechanical gap—it is an invitation to develop distinctive behaviors, habits, and coping strategies that make your character memorable. The most compelling characters are defined as much by how they handle their limitations as by how they leverage their strengths.

**Low MIG – Physical Limitations**

Characters with low Might develop workarounds for situations that demand raw strength or endurance. Consider how your character:

- **Compensates with tools**: Carries a crowbar, lever, or block-and-tackle for heavy lifting. Knows where to find improvised assistance.
- **Delegates physical tasks**: Naturally steps back when brute force is required. Offers to keep watch, handle logistics, or provide moral support while others do the heavy work.
- **Avoids exhausting situations**: Prefers shorter routes over grueling marches. Rests more frequently. May have developed efficient movement habits to conserve energy.
- **Leverages positioning**: When physical confrontation is unavoidable, seeks advantageous terrain, weapons with reach, or surprise rather than trading blows.

> **Example**
> Tomas has MIG 0. When the group needs to barricade a door against pursuers, he does not stand uselessly—he identifies which furniture will wedge most effectively, directs placement, and watches for the moment when the door begins to give. His contribution is expertise, not muscle.

**Low AGI – Deliberate Movement**

Characters with low Agility develop caution and awareness around situations that demand grace, speed, or precision. Consider how your character:

- **Moves deliberately**: Takes extra time on uncertain footing. Places each step with intention rather than rushing. May appear overly careful to others.
- **Avoids precarious situations**: Chooses the ladder over the drainpipe. Takes the long way around rather than the narrow ledge. Voices concern when plans require acrobatic feats.
- **Prepares thoroughly**: Since quick reactions are unreliable, invests in preparation. Checks equipment twice. Scouts approaches in advance.
- **Accepts limitations gracefully**: Knows when to let the nimble party member handle something delicate. Does not pretend capabilities they lack.

> **Example**
> Mira has AGI 0. When the group must cross a rain-slicked rooftop, she does not attempt to keep pace with the scouts. Instead, she finds a different route—through the building—and meets them on the other side. Her path takes longer but carries less risk of a fatal slip.

**Low PRE – Quiet Influence**

Characters with low Presence develop alternative methods for social situations where charisma or force of personality would typically dominate. Consider how your character:

- **Prefers written communication**: Drafts letters, sends messages through intermediaries, or requests time to prepare remarks. The written word allows careful thought without the pressure of immediate response.
- **Builds influence through competence**: Earns respect by demonstrating skill, reliability, or knowledge rather than winning people over with charm. Actions speak where words falter.
- **Avoids the spotlight**: Lets others make speeches, deliver ultimatums, or command attention. Contributes from behind the scenes or through one-on-one conversations rather than group address.
- **Relies on genuine connection**: Forms relationships slowly but authentically. May have a small circle of people who trust them deeply rather than a wide network of acquaintances.

> **Example**
> Jin has PRE 0. When the group needs to persuade a reluctant witness, Jin does not take the lead. Instead, they compile evidence, prepare talking points, and hand the material to the party's more charismatic negotiator. The persuasion succeeds partly because of Jin's unseen groundwork.

**Low RSN – Instinctive Action**

Characters with low Reason develop approaches that rely on intuition, experience, or collaboration rather than analysis. Consider how your character:

- **Trusts gut instincts**: Makes decisions based on feeling, experience, or pattern recognition rather than logical deduction. Acts decisively rather than deliberating.
- **Asks for explanations**: When complex information arises, requests that others break it down. Not ashamed to say, "Explain it to me simply."
- **Values practical knowledge**: Knows how things work through experience rather than theory. Can fix a machine without understanding why the fix works.
- **Leans on trusted allies**: Identifies the party members who excel at analysis and defers to their judgment on matters requiring careful thought.

> **Example**
> Sera has RSN 0. When the group discovers encoded documents, she does not waste time puzzling over them. She hands the papers to the party's analyst and says, "Tell me who to confront when you figure it out." Her contribution will come later, when action is required.

### Roleplay Prompts by Attribute Level

The following tables offer questions to consider at each Attribute level. Use these prompts during character creation, between sessions, or whenever you want to deepen your portrayal. There are no right answers—only opportunities to discover who your character is.

### Examples by Attribute

#### Might (MIG)

Might represents physical strength, raw effort, and bodily resilience. It appears whenever you forcefully
        move, lift, or endure something.

> **Example**
> **Example – MIG Check**
*Trigger:*A storm has washed out a small bridge. The group needs to move a heavy improvised
>         plank into place before the river rises further.
*Roll:*The GM calls for a MIG-based Check using**4d6**against DC 16 (Tough). The
>         character with MIG 2 and the appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`.
*Consequence:*On a full success, the plank is set and the group crosses safely. On a partial
>         success, the plank holds but the character gains a Strained condition. On a failure, the plank slips,
>         and the GM advances a flood Clock.

#### Agility (AGI)

Agility covers balance, precision, and quick reactions. It appears when you dodge, climb, sneak, or
        operate fine mechanisms under pressure.

> **Example**
> **Example – AGI Check**
*Trigger:*A character sprints across slick rooftop tiles to reach a signal mast before an alarm
>         spreads.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 18 (Hard) due to rain and height. The character with AGI 1 and a relevant
>         Skill rolls `4d6+1`. A hazardous Tag on the roof may impose Burden if the group ignored earlier
>         warnings.
*Consequence:*On a full success, they reach the mast in time. On a partial success, they make
>         it but leave evidence behind or trigger a lesser alarm. On a failure, they slip, and the GM ticks a
>         danger Clock or applies a Condition such as Exposed or Dazed.

#### Presence (PRE)

Presence governs social force, confidence, and emotional weight. It appears when you persuade, command,
        intimidate, or rally others.

> **Example**
> **Example – PRE Check**
*Trigger:*The group needs a nervous official to delay a shipment. A character steps forward to
>         make the case.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 14 (Routine) if the request is modest, or higher if the stakes are severe.
>         The character with PRE 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`. Helpful Tags (Shared History) or
>         Proficiencies (Bureaucratic Procedures) may grant Edge.
*Consequence:*On a full success, the delay is granted cleanly. On a partial success, the delay
>         comes with a favor owed or a complication. On a failure, the official refuses and alerts a rival faction.

#### Reason (RSN)

Reason covers analysis, pattern recognition, and careful observation. It appears when you investigate,
        deduce, plan, or notice hidden details.

> **Example**
> **Example – RSN Check**
*Trigger:*A character studies overlapping telegraph logs to determine whether a recent outage is
>         natural or engineered.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 16 (Tough). The character with RSN 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls
>         `4d6+2`. A relevant Proficiency (Telegraph Instruments) may lower the DC or reveal extra context on a
>         success.
*Consequence:*On a full success, they identify the outage as deliberate and tie it to a specific
>         region. On a partial success, they confirm it was engineered but only narrow the possibilities. On a
>         failure, they misinterpret the data and the GM advances a faction Clock based on that error.

### Multi-Attribute Actions and Teamwork

Many scenes involve multiple characters and overlapping actions. Instead of treating every moment as a
        separate Check, think about how Attributes combine across the group.

- One character might use MIG to hold a door while another uses RSN to bypass its lock.
- A PRE-focused character might draw attention so an AGI-focused ally can move unseen.
- Two characters with different strengths might both roll, with the table focusing on the more
          interesting result.

The GM decides whether each character rolls separately, one character rolls with assistance, or a single
        roll represents the group's combined effort. Whichever option you choose, keep intent and approach in
        view. Assistance should make sense in the fiction, not just on the character sheet.

### Attribute Growth Preview

Attributes do not change every session. They grow slowly across a campaign as characters reach important
        milestones, resolve personal threads, and survive significant consequences. Advancement rules appear in
        the Advancement and Long Term Growth chapter later in this book.

When Attributes do increase, the change should feel meaningful in the fiction. A rise in MIG might come
        after a season of hard labor or survival in harsh conditions. A rise in RSN might follow extended study,
        investigative breakthroughs, or hard lessons learned from mistakes. Treat Attribute growth as an
        opportunity to reflect on how the character has changed, not just as a numerical upgrade.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Signaling Growth**When a player increases an Attribute, ask them to describe one moment from the campaign that symbolizes
>         that change. Then add a Tag to the world, a new relationship, or an updated detail on the character's
>         sheet that reflects their growth. This keeps advancement grounded in the shared story rather than only
>         in numbers.

## 8. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

This chapter describes the core resolution engine of the game. Whenever a character takes an action and the outcome is uncertain, consequential, and within their reach to influence, the table may call for a Check. Checks turn intent and approach into dice, and dice back into story beats. Understanding how to call for, perform, and interpret Checks is essential for both players and the GM.

> **Check Procedure Summary**
>
> Follow these seven steps to resolve any Check:
>
> 1. **Player declares intent and approach** - State what you want to achieve (intent) and how you are trying to achieve it (approach)
> 2. **GM determines if a Check is needed** - A Check is only appropriate when three conditions are all true: uncertainty (outcome is not predetermined), consequence (failure matters), and agency (character can influence the result)
> 3. **GM sets DC using the DC ladder** - Choose the appropriate difficulty: 12 (Easy), 14 (Routine), 16 (Tough), 18 (Hard), 20 (Heroic), or 22 (Legendary)
> 4. **GM determines Edge or Burden from circumstances** - Assess Tags, Conditions, tools, assistance, and positioning. Net the modifiers (+1 Edge and -1 Burden cancel out). Cap at +/-2
> 5. **Player rolls 4d6, adds Attribute, adds +1 if relevant Skill applies** - With Edge, roll extra dice and keep the best 4. With Burden, roll extra dice and keep the worst 4
> 6. **Calculate margin (result - DC) and determine outcome tier** - Margin +5 or more = Critical Success, 0 to +4 = Full Success, -1 to -2 = Partial Success, -3 to -6 = Failure, -7 or worse = Critical Failure
> 7. **GM narrates the outcome** - Describe what happens in the fiction based on the outcome tier

### When to Roll (and When Not To)

You roll when the GM calls for a Check. The GM should only do this when three conditions are all true:

- **Uncertainty**: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal conditions does not roll.
- **Consequence**: Failure or partial success would introduce tension, cost, or change. If failure just means "try again until it works," do not roll.
- **Agency**: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Do not roll for things entirely outside the characters' control.

If all three are present, a Check is appropriate. If one or more are missing, the GM either says "yes" and narrates success, or "no" and explains why it is impossible or out of scope. Checks are tools for focusing on interesting uncertainty, not a gate in front of every action.

> **Example - When to Roll**
> *Trigger:* A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous.
> *Assessment:* The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character's choices matter. The GM calls for a Check.
> *Counter-example:* The same character crossing a sturdy bridge in calm weather does not roll. Success is assumed; the story moves forward.

#### When-to-Roll Worked Examples

The three-part test (Uncertainty, Consequence, Agency) is not always obvious. The following examples show how the same basic action can shift from "no roll needed" to "Check required" based on changing circumstances.

> **Example - Climbing a Fence**
>
> **Scenario A: No Roll Needed**
> Tomas wants to climb over the wooden fence surrounding the merchant's yard. He is alone, unhurried, and the fence has plenty of handholds.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* No. Tomas is reasonably fit, the fence is climbable, and nothing interferes.
> - *Consequence?* No. If he slips, he tries again. No time pressure, no observers.
> - *Agency?* Yes. Tomas can climb or not climb.
>
> **Result:** Two conditions fail. No Check. The GM says, "You pull yourself over the fence and drop into the yard. What do you do next?"
>
> ---
>
> **Scenario B: Now Roll**
> Same fence, but now city guards are pursuing Tomas. He hears their boots pounding the cobblestones behind him. Every second counts.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* Yes. Under pressure, even simple tasks can go wrong.
> - *Consequence?* Yes. If he is slow, the guards catch him. If he falls, he is exposed.
> - *Agency?* Yes. His speed and choices matter.
>
> **Result:** All three conditions are met. The GM calls for an AGI-based Check. DC 12 (Easy—the fence is still climbable, but time pressure adds tension).

> **Example - Recalling Facts**
>
> **Scenario A: No Roll Needed**
> Sera wants to remember the name of the magistrate who oversees trade disputes. She studied law for years and this is common knowledge in her field.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* No. This is routine knowledge for her background.
> - *Consequence?* No. She can look it up if she forgets; the information is not secret.
> - *Agency?* Yes. She either knows it or not.
>
> **Result:** Two conditions fail. No Check. The GM says, "You recall that Magistrate Velloran handles trade disputes from the River Court."
>
> ---
>
> **Scenario B: Now Roll**
> Same question, but Sera is standing before the magistrate's clerk, who is about to close the office. She needs to name the correct magistrate *right now* to file her petition before the deadline. Getting it wrong means her client's case is delayed by a month.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* Yes. Under pressure, memory can fail.
> - *Consequence?* Yes. Wrong answer means a month's delay for her client.
> - *Agency?* Yes. Her training and mental composure matter.
>
> **Result:** All three conditions are met. The GM calls for a RSN-based Check. DC 14 (Routine—she knows this, but pressure makes it harder to retrieve).

> **Example - Fixing a Machine**
>
> **Scenario A: No Roll Needed**
> Vance wants to repair a jammed printing press in his workshop. He has his tools, the machine is a model he knows well, and he has all afternoon.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* No. This is routine maintenance for him.
> - *Consequence?* No. If it takes longer, he just keeps working. No deadline.
> - *Agency?* Yes. His skill can fix it.
>
> **Result:** Two conditions fail. No Check. The GM says, "You spend an hour disassembling the feed mechanism, clear the jam, and reassemble it. The press runs smoothly again."
>
> ---
>
> **Scenario B: Now Roll**
> Same printing press, but Vance's tools were confiscated when he fled his workshop. He has only a borrowed screwdriver and a bent wire. The press must work by tonight to print pamphlets for the demonstration.
>
> *Applying the Three-Part Test:*
> - *Uncertainty?* Yes. Without proper tools, success is not guaranteed.
> - *Consequence?* Yes. Failure means no pamphlets, and the demonstration loses support.
> - *Agency?* Yes. His improvisation and skill can overcome the obstacle.
>
> **Result:** All three conditions are met. The GM calls for an AGI-based Check (delicate work without proper tools). DC 16 (Tough—improvised tools make a routine task significantly harder).

### The Core Check Procedure

Every Check follows the same basic loop:

1. The player declares intent and approach.
1. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
1. If needed, the GM selects an Attribute and relevant Skill, sets a DC, and notes any Tags, Conditions, or Proficiencies that might grant Edge or Burden.
1. The player rolls **4d6**, applies modifiers, and compares the total to the DC.
1. The table interprets the outcome tier (critical success, full success, partial success, failure, critical failure) and updates the fiction accordingly.

### Declaring Intent and Approach

When you declare an action, you state two things:

- **Intent**: What you want to achieve in the fiction.
- **Approach**: How you are trying to achieve it.

Intent focuses the scene. Approach determines which Attribute, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and Conditions are relevant. The more concrete and grounded your description, the easier it is for the GM to set an appropriate DC and for the group to picture the moment.

> **Example - Intent and Approach**
> *Intent:* "I want to get the factory foreman to delay shipment of the crates."
> *Approach:* "I speak with her in private, emphasize the safety risks, and show her evidence of the faulty wiring we found."
> The GM recognizes this as a PRE-based approach with a relevant social Skill and possibly a Proficiency related to safety procedures or technical documentation.

> **GM Guidance - Choosing the Right Attribute**
>
> The player's approach determines which Attribute applies. Use these key words to guide selection:
>
> | Attribute | Key Words | Character Is... |
> |-----------|-----------|-----------------|
> | **MIG** | Force, lift, break, endure, overpower, resist, hold, smash | Applying raw physical power or enduring hardship |
> | **AGI** | Dodge, climb, sneak, aim, balance, tumble, sprint, pick (locks) | Using speed, coordination, or fine motor control |
> | **PRE** | Persuade, intimidate, charm, deceive, perform, inspire, read (people) | Influencing others through personality or social skill |
> | **RSN** | Investigate, analyze, recall, deduce, plan, notice, research | Using knowledge, logic, or careful observation |
>
> **Same Goal, Different Attributes**
>
> The same objective can often be achieved through different approaches, each using a different Attribute. Consider a locked door standing between you and your goal:
>
> - **MIG Approach:** "I shoulder-charge the door, breaking it off its hinges." (Force the door open through brute strength. Loud, fast, but obvious.)
> - **AGI Approach:** "I kneel down and carefully pick the lock with my tools." (Bypass the lock through dexterity and precision. Quiet but takes time.)
> - **PRE Approach:** "I knock and convince whoever answers that I am here for an inspection." (Talk your way past the obstacle. Requires someone on the other side.)
> - **RSN Approach:** "I examine the door frame and hinges to find a structural weakness I can exploit." (Analyze the door to find the easiest point of entry. Takes time but might reveal a clever solution.)
>
> Each approach has different DCs, different risks, and different fictional consequences. A MIG approach to the door might be DC 14 but alerts everyone nearby. An AGI approach might be DC 16 but leaves no evidence. The GM sets DC based on what the character is actually attempting, not on the abstract goal.

### Setting DCs

The GM sets a **Difficulty Class (DC)** to represent how hard the task is under current circumstances. The system uses a standard ladder:

#### Standard DC Ladder

| DC | Difficulty | When to Use | Concrete Examples |
|----|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **12** | Easy | Favorable conditions, strong fictional positioning, minor obstacles, or when the character has clear advantages | Climbing a rough stone wall with plenty of handholds; persuading a friendly contact to share non-sensitive information; recalling common knowledge about a familiar topic |
| **14** | Routine | Standard conditions, typical challenges, no special advantage or disadvantage, baseline competent opposition | Picking a standard lock with proper tools; convincing a neutral stranger to provide directions; tracking fresh footprints on soft ground |
| **16** | Tough | Unfavorable conditions, skilled opposition, time pressure, or when the character lacks ideal resources | Convincing a suspicious guard to let you pass without credentials; climbing a smooth wall with few handholds; recalling obscure historical details under pressure |
| **18** | Hard | Hostile conditions, significant obstacles, high stakes, or active countermeasures from opposition | Disarming a complex trap while enemies approach; persuading a hostile official to overlook a minor crime; picking a high-quality lock without specialized tools |
| **20** | Heroic | Extreme conditions, exceptional challenges, pushing the limits of what trained individuals can accomplish | Leaping between rooftops in a thunderstorm; convincing a mob to disperse without violence; navigating treacherous terrain while wounded and exhausted |
| **22** | Legendary | Near-impossible feats, setting-defining moments, the absolute edge of mortal capability | Talking down a raging dragon mid-attack; climbing a sheer ice cliff during a blizzard without equipment; deciphering an alien language in minutes |

Start by imagining what success would look like in the scene and how far it is from effortless. Use lower DCs when characters have strong fictional positioning, good information, and safe conditions. Use higher DCs when time is short, the environment is hostile, or the task is at the edge of what is possible in the setting.

> **Note**
> DCs should reflect fictional positioning, not abstract difficulty. The same task might be DC 14 in good conditions and DC 18 in poor conditions. Let the story guide the number.

> **GM Guidance - Setting DCs in Practice**
> When selecting a DC, ask yourself: "What would make this task harder or easier?" Consider the character's preparation, available tools, environmental factors, and opposition awareness. A well-prepared character attempting a task in favorable conditions deserves a lower DC than an improvising character under hostile circumstances.
>
> **Quick DC Benchmarks:**
> - **DC 12:** Climbing a rough stone wall in good conditions—plenty of handholds, no time pressure, dry weather.
> - **DC 14:** Picking a standard commercial lock—common mechanism, proper tools, adequate lighting.
> - **DC 16:** Persuading a suspicious guard to look the other way—they have no reason to trust you, but no reason to be hostile either.
> - **DC 18:** Disarming a trap while under fire—you know what you are doing, but enemies are shooting at you and time is critical.
> - **DC 20:** Leaping between rooftops in a storm—the gap is wide, the surfaces are slick, the wind is unpredictable.
>
> Ground each DC in the specific, imaginable situation at hand. If you can picture the scene clearly, the right DC usually follows.

### Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions

Rather than constantly adjusting the DC, the game often represents favorable or unfavorable circumstances through **Edge** and **Burden**.

> **Edge and Burden Quick Reference**
>
> | Modifier | Dice Change | Common Sources |
> |----------|-------------|----------------|
> | **+1 Edge** | Roll 5d6, keep best 4 | Good positioning, helpful Tag, ally assistance, right tools |
> | **+2 Edge** | Roll 6d6, keep best 4 | Exceptional setup, multiple advantages combined, perfect conditions |
> | **-1 Burden** | Roll 5d6, keep worst 4 | Unfavorable Tag, minor Condition, poor visibility, improvised tools |
> | **-2 Burden** | Roll 6d6, keep worst 4 | Severe Condition, multiple disadvantages, hostile environment |
>
> **Stacking:** Multiple sources combine into a single level, capped at +/-2. If you have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (e.g., +2 Edge and -1 Burden = +1 Edge).

Edge and Burden usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies, or prior setup actions. They represent the table's shared sense that the character is favored or hindered in this moment. Multiple sources combine into a single level of Edge or Burden and are capped at +/-2—several small edges do not create infinite Edge, and multiple problems do not push you below -2. If a character would have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (for example, +2 and -1 becomes +1) until only one side remains, then apply the final level.

Tags and Conditions described in earlier chapters provide a shared vocabulary for these modifiers: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, or *Exposed* might impose Burden; *Solid Cover* or *Marked* might grant Edge in specific contexts or to specific parties.

> **Example - Combining Multiple Modifier Sources**
>
> Kira attempts to pick a lock on a warehouse door. The GM assesses the modifiers from multiple sources:
>
> - **+1 Edge** from her Lockpicking Tools Proficiency (she has the right equipment and knows how to use it)
> - **+1 Edge** from an ally's **Set Up** action (Dex watched the guard's patrol pattern and signaled the optimal moment)
> - **-1 Burden** from *Dim Light* (the alley is poorly lit, making precision work harder)
>
> The modifiers stack: +1 +1 -1 = +1 Edge total.
>
> With +1 Edge, Kira rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4. She rolls 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and keeps 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Adding AGI +2 gives her a total of 20 against DC 16. Margin = +4, a **Full Success**. The lock clicks open quietly.
>
> **Note:** Edge and Burden cap at +/-2. Even if Kira had four sources of Edge, she would still only roll 6d6 and keep the best 4. The cap prevents modifier stacking from overwhelming the dice.

### Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

When a Check is called for, follow this procedure:

1. Roll **4d6**, adjusting the number of dice kept if Edge or Burden applies.
1. Add the relevant Attribute rating.
1. **Add +1 if you have a relevant Skill.** Having a relevant Skill adds +1 to your Check result. This bonus is binary—you either have the Skill (+1) or you do not (+0). There are no Skill levels or ranks.
1. Add any other bonuses from temporary effects.
1. Compare the total to the DC to find the **margin** (Result - DC).

The margin determines the outcome tier. Use the following ranges to identify which tier applies:

#### Outcome Tier Margin Ranges

| Margin Range | Outcome Tier | Summary |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **+5 or more** | Critical Success | Exceptional result; exceed your goal with bonus benefits |
| **0 to +4** | Full Success | Clean success; achieve your intent without significant cost |
| **-1 to -2** | Partial Success | Success with cost; achieve your goal but pay a price |
| **-3 to -6** | Failure | Goal not achieved; situation worsens or complicates |
| **-7 or worse** | Critical Failure | Significant setback; major escalation or consequence |

> **Note**
> Rolling all 1s on your dice (before keeping) also triggers a **Critical Failure**, regardless of margin. This represents catastrophic bad luck.

### 4d6 Probability Reference

Understanding the math behind 4d6 helps you gauge your chances and make informed tactical decisions. The following table shows the probability distribution for raw 4d6 rolls (before adding Attribute or Skill modifiers).

#### 4d6 Roll Distribution

| Roll Total | Probability | Cumulative (roll this or higher) |
|------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **4** | 0.08% | 100% |
| **5** | 0.31% | 99.92% |
| **6** | 0.77% | 99.61% |
| **7** | 1.54% | 98.84% |
| **8** | 2.70% | 97.30% |
| **9** | 4.32% | 94.60% |
| **10** | 6.17% | 90.28% |
| **11** | 8.02% | 84.11% |
| **12** | 9.65% | 76.09% |
| **13** | 10.49% | 66.44% |
| **14** | 10.80% | 55.95% |
| **15** | 10.49% | 45.15% |
| **16** | 9.65% | 34.66% |
| **17** | 8.02% | 25.01% |
| **18** | 6.17% | 16.99% |
| **19** | 4.32% | 10.82% |
| **20** | 2.70% | 6.50% |
| **21** | 1.54% | 3.80% |
| **22** | 0.77% | 2.26% |
| **23** | 0.31% | 1.49% |
| **24** | 0.08% | 1.18% |

**Key Insight:** The average 4d6 roll is 14. With a typical Attribute of +2, you will average 16—enough for a Routine (DC 14) task with margin to spare.

### Success Probability by DC

This table shows your percentage chance of achieving at least a **Full Success** (margin 0 or higher) based on your total modifier and the DC. Use this during character building or tactical planning.

| DC | With +0 | With +2 | With +4 | With +2 and +1 Edge |
|----|---------|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **12** | 76% | 90% | 97% | 95% |
| **14** | 56% | 76% | 90% | 87% |
| **16** | 35% | 56% | 76% | 68% |
| **18** | 17% | 35% | 56% | 46% |
| **20** | 6% | 17% | 35% | 26% |

> **What the Numbers Mean**
>
> The 4d6 system creates a predictable, skill-respecting curve:
>
> - **Average roll is 14.** Slightly more than half your rolls (56%) land at 14 or higher. This makes Routine (DC 14) tasks achievable more often than not without bonuses.
> - **Each +2 Attribute shifts success by approximately 20%.** Going from +0 to +2 improves your odds—a +2 character has 76% success on DC 14, compared to 56% for +0.
> - **Edge adds roughly 10-12% success chance.** Rolling 5d6 and keeping the best 4 shifts your average from 14 to approximately 15.5, giving you about one point of effective bonus.
> - **The system favors competent characters.** DC 14 is "Routine" for a reason—a character with +2 in their relevant Attribute succeeds three-quarters of the time. The challenge comes from Tough (DC 16) and Hard (DC 18) tasks, where every point of modifier matters.
>
> **Practical Application:** If you have +2 in an Attribute and attempt a DC 16 task, you have a 56% chance of Full Success. Adding Edge improves that to 68%. This is why fictional positioning and setup actions matter—they can shift borderline tasks into reliable territory.

> The GM applies the three-part test:
>
> - *Uncertainty?* Yes—the manor is active with servants, guests, and guards. Even with preparation, detection is possible.
> - *Consequence?* Yes—if Lyra is caught, she faces arrest, Lord Ashworth is alerted, and the mission fails.
> - *Agency?* Yes—Lyra's skill, preparation, and choices directly influence whether she succeeds.
>
> All three conditions are met. The GM calls for a Check.
>
> ---
>
> **Step 3: GM sets DC using the DC ladder**
>
> The GM considers the circumstances:
>
> - The servant corridors are less trafficked than the main halls (favorable)
> - Guards patrol but are focused on the perimeter and main entrances (neutral)
> - The dinner party creates ambient noise and movement (favorable for concealment)
> - The study is in a private wing—being seen there would raise questions (unfavorable)
>
> Balancing these factors, the GM sets **DC 16** (Tough—skilled opposition in the form of alert guards, some unfavorable conditions in the private wing, but good preparation).
>
> ---
>
> **Step 4: GM determines Edge or Burden from circumstances**
>
> The GM tallies modifiers:
>
> - **+1 Edge** from *Dim Light* (the poorly lit corridors favor stealth)
> - **+1 Edge** from Marcus's reconnaissance (he identified the patrol timing)
> - The servant's uniform is good fictional positioning but does not stack to another Edge—it is already factored into the DC being 16 rather than 18
>
> Net calculation: +1 +1 = **+2 Edge total** (capped, no additional sources matter)
>
> Wait—the GM reconsiders. The *Dim Light* helps Lyra hide, but it also makes it harder for her to spot guards before they spot her. The GM rules this is a wash for the stealth attempt specifically, so:
>
> - **+1 Edge** from Marcus's reconnaissance (timing information)
>
> **Final modifier: +1 Edge**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 5: Player rolls 4d6, adds Attribute, adds +1 if relevant Skill applies**
>
> With +1 Edge, Lyra rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4.
>
> **Dice rolled:** 3, 4, 4, 5, 6
> **Dice kept (best 4):** 4, 4, 5, 6
> **Dice total:** 4 + 4 + 5 + 6 = **19**
>
> Now add modifiers:
> - Attribute (AGI): +2
> - Skill (Stealth): +1
>
> **Final result:** 19 + 2 + 1 = **22**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 6: Calculate margin (result - DC) and determine outcome tier**
>
> **Margin:** 22 - 16 = **+6**
>
> Consulting the outcome tier table:
> - **+5 or more = Critical Success** (this one)
> - 0 to +4 = Full Success
> - -1 to -2 = Partial Success
> - -3 to -6 = Failure
> - -7 or worse = Critical Failure
>
> **Outcome Tier: Critical Success**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 7: GM narrates the outcome**
>
> "You move through the servant corridors like a ghost. Marcus's timing is perfect—you slip past each patrol intersection in the gaps between rounds. A maid nearly bumps into you at a corner, but you step aside with a murmured apology, and she does not give you a second glance. When you reach the private wing, you notice something Marcus could not have seen from outside: the guard assigned to this corridor is asleep in an alcove, an empty wine bottle beside him. You reach the study door completely undetected—and you now know the guard rotation has a gap no one else has noticed. This information could prove valuable later."

> *Final result:* 17 + 2 (AGI) + 1 (Skill) = 20.
> *Margin:* 20 - 16 = +4.
>
> *GM Narration:* "You navigate the servant corridors without incident. The patrols pass at exactly the intervals Marcus predicted. When you reach the private wing, you pause at a corner as a guard strolls past, then continue to the study door. You are in position, undetected, ready to proceed."
>
> *Full Success:* Lyra achieves her intent cleanly. No bonus, but no complications either.
>
> ---
>
> **Partial Success (Margin -1)**
>
> *Roll:* 5d6 showing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Keep best 4: 2, 3, 4, 5 = 14.
> *Final result:* 14 + 2 (AGI) + 1 (Skill) = 17.
> *Margin:* 17 - 16 = +1... wait, that is still Full Success.
>
> Let us try: 5d6 showing 1, 1, 3, 4, 5. Keep best 4: 1, 3, 4, 5 = 13.
> *Final result:* 13 + 2 (AGI) + 1 (Skill) = 16.
> *Margin:* 16 - 16 = 0. Still Full Success.
>
> For Partial Success, we need margin -1 or -2:
> *Roll:* 5d6 showing 1, 2, 2, 3, 4. Keep best 4: 2, 2, 3, 4 = 11.
> *Final result:* 11 + 2 (AGI) + 1 (Skill) = 14.
> *Margin:* 14 - 16 = **-2**.
>
> *GM Narration:* "You make it to the private wing, but a servant spots you as you pass through the kitchen corridor. 'You there—what are you doing in the east wing? Servants use the west stairs.' You mumble something about being new and getting lost, and she seems to accept it, but she watches you until you are out of sight. You reach the study door, but now someone knows a servant was where servants should not be. If anything goes wrong tonight, she will remember you."
>
> *Partial Success cost:* Lyra reaches her goal, but a witness can identify her. This complication may matter later.
>
> ---
>
> **Failure (Margin -4)**
>
> *Roll:* 5d6 showing 1, 1, 2, 3, 3. Keep best 4: 1, 2, 3, 3 = 9.
> *Final result:* 9 + 2 (AGI) + 1 (Skill) = 12.
> *Margin:* 12 - 16 = **-4**.
>
> *GM Narration:* "You round a corner and nearly collide with a guard—one whose route Marcus did not observe because he only patrols inside. He looks at you, then at the private wing corridor behind you. 'What business does a servant have in Lord Ashworth's private quarters?' His hand rests on his truncheon. You are not caught yet, but you need to explain yourself, and the study is still twenty feet away down a guarded hall. What do you do?"
>
> *Failure:* Lyra does not reach the study. The situation has worsened—she must now talk her way past the guard (a new PRE-based Check) or find another approach. The "Alert Level" Clock might tick forward.

> *Margin:* 10 - 16 = **-6**. That is regular Failure, not Critical.
>
> For Critical Failure (margin -7 or worse):
> *Roll:* 5d6 showing 1, 1, 1, 2, 2. Keep best 4: 1, 1, 2, 2 = 6.
> *Final result:* 6 + 2 (AGI) + 1 (Skill) = 9.
> *Margin:* 9 - 16 = **-7**.
>
> *GM Narration:* "You step into the private wing corridor—and freeze. Lord Ashworth himself stands at the far end, speaking quietly with his head of security. They both look up at the same moment. The security chief's eyes narrow. 'You. Halt.' Ashworth's expression shifts from curiosity to cold suspicion. There is no innocent explanation for a servant in his private wing during a party. Guards are summoned. Your cover is blown, and worse—Ashworth now knows someone is interested in his private quarters. Even if you escape tonight, he will move or destroy those documents."
>
> *Critical Failure:* The mission is severely compromised. Not only does Lyra fail to reach the study, but the target is now alerted. The entire operation may need to be abandoned or dramatically revised.

### Complete Check Example

The following example demonstrates every step of Check resolution with all numbers shown. Use this as a reference for how the full mechanical sequence works.

> **Complete Check Example - Warehouse Infiltration**
>
> **Scene Setup:**
> Vance needs to bypass a security panel to enter a restricted warehouse. The environment has the following Tags:
> - *Dim Light* (the loading dock has minimal lighting)
> - *Patrolled* (guards make regular rounds)
>
> Vance has:
> - AGI +2 (his Agility Attribute rating)
> - Technical Work Skill (relevant to bypassing security systems)
> - Electronic Systems Proficiency (he knows this type of panel)
>
> His ally Sera spent the previous scene observing the guard rotation and panel model, providing useful intelligence.
>
> ---
>
> **Step 1: Player declares intent and approach**
> *Intent:* "I want to bypass the security panel without triggering any alarms."
> *Approach:* "I use the information Sera gathered about the panel model to find its known vulnerabilities, working quickly between guard patrols."
>
> ---
>
> **Step 2: GM determines if a Check is needed**
> - *Uncertainty:* Yes—the panel is sophisticated and Vance is working under pressure.
> - *Consequence:* Yes—failure could trigger alarms or alert guards.
> - *Agency:* Yes—Vance's skills and preparation can influence the outcome.
>
> All three conditions are met. The GM calls for a Check.
>
> ---
>
> **Step 3: GM sets DC using the DC ladder**
> The GM considers the circumstances:
> - The security panel is high-quality commercial grade
> - Time pressure from guard patrols
> - Unfavorable lighting conditions
>
> The GM sets **DC 18** (Hard—sophisticated system with significant obstacles).
>
> ---
>
> **Step 4: GM determines Edge or Burden from circumstances**
> The GM tallies modifiers:
> - **+1 Edge** from Sera's reconnaissance (valuable intel about the panel)
> - **+1 Edge** from Electronic Systems Proficiency (Vance knows this type of system)
> - **-1 Burden** from *Dim Light* (poor visibility for precision work)
>
> Net calculation: +1 +1 -1 = **+1 Edge total**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 5: Player rolls 4d6, adds Attribute, adds +1 if relevant Skill applies**
> With +1 Edge, Vance rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4.
>
> **Dice rolled:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
> **Dice kept (best 4):** 3, 4, 5, 6
> **Dice total:** 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = **18**
>
> Now add modifiers:
> - Attribute (AGI): +2
> - Skill (Technical Work): +1
>
> **Final result:** 18 + 2 + 1 = **21**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 6: Calculate margin (result - DC) and determine outcome tier**
> **Margin:** 21 - 18 = **+3**
>
> Consulting the outcome tier table:
> - +5 or more = Critical Success
> - **0 to +4 = Full Success** (this one)
> - -1 to -2 = Partial Success
> - -3 to -6 = Failure
> - -7 or worse = Critical Failure
>
> **Outcome Tier: Full Success**
>
> ---
>
> **Step 7: GM narrates the outcome**
> "The panel's indicator light blinks from red to green. Vance's fingers move with practiced efficiency—Sera's intel was spot-on about the firmware vulnerability. The door slides open silently. You're in, with no alarms triggered and the guards none the wiser."
>
> ---
>
> **Alternate Outcome - What if Vance rolled worse?**
>
> Suppose Vance had rolled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on his 5d6 and kept 2, 3, 4, 5 = 14.
>
> **Final result:** 14 + 2 (AGI) + 1 (Skill) = **17**
> **Margin:** 17 - 18 = **-1**
> **Outcome Tier: Partial Success**
>
> *GM Narration:* "The panel accepts your bypass, but it takes longer than expected—you hear footsteps approaching. The door opens, but now you must decide: slip inside and hope the guard passes, or abort and find cover? Either way, the 'Guard Alert' Clock ticks forward by 1 segment."

### Interpreting Outcomes

Every outcome tier should change the situation. The GM and players work together to describe what the dice mean in the fiction.

- **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more) – You achieve more than you aimed for. Extra benefits, stronger position, or accelerated progress. In combat, this often means additional Clock ticks or bonus effects.
- **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) – You get what you wanted with no significant cost. The scene moves forward cleanly. Your intent is fulfilled as stated.
- **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2) – You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect. Momentum continues, tension rises. Common costs include: resource expenditure, unwanted attention, reduced scope of success, or new obligations.
- **Failure** (margin -3 to -6) – You do not achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Threats advance, resources strain, or positions worsen. The GM should advance threat Clocks or introduce new complications.
- **Critical Failure** (margin -7 or worse, or all 1s) – Things go significantly wrong. Use sparingly for dramatic beats: broken tools, dangerous exposure, or major escalations. This is not punishment—it is an opportunity for dramatic tension.

### Worked Examples

The following examples demonstrate complete Check resolution from intent through outcome. Study these to understand how the mechanical sequence flows in actual play.

> **Example - Social Check with Partial Success**
>
> *Scene:* Mira needs to convince a merchant to sell rare components at a fair price. The merchant is greedy but not hostile.
>
> *Intent:* "I want the merchant to sell me the precision lenses at cost."
> *Approach:* "I appeal to his reputation among the guild, mentioning that fair dealing now will bring future business from my contacts."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is a PRE-based Check using a social Skill. The merchant is motivated by profit but values his reputation. DC 14 (Routine social negotiation with a neutral party).
>
> *Modifiers:* Mira has the Negotiation Skill (+1) and mentions her guild contacts, which the GM rules is good fictional positioning but not quite Edge-worthy on its own.
>
> *Roll:* Mira rolls 4d6: 2, 3, 4, 5 = 14. Adding PRE +2 and Skill +1 = 17.
> *Margin:* 17 - 14 = +3.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The merchant agrees to sell at cost, impressed by Mira's guild connections and the promise of future business. She obtains the precision lenses without complication.
>
> ---
>
> *Alternate Roll:* Suppose Mira had rolled 4d6: 1, 2, 3, 4 = 10. Adding PRE +2 and Skill +1 = 13.
> *Margin:* 13 - 14 = -1.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The merchant agrees to sell the lenses at cost, but names his price: Mira must bring him first pick of salvage from her next job. She has the components she needs, but now owes a favor that may prove inconvenient later.

> **Example - Combat Check with Strike Outcome and Clock Ticks**
>
> *Scene:* During a warehouse fight, Kira faces a hired thug. The environment is marked with *Crates* (cover) and *Dim Light*. Kira's ally Dex used a **Set Up** action last turn to flank the thug, granting Kira Edge.
>
> *Intent:* "I want to take down this thug before reinforcements arrive."
> *Approach:* "I strike at his weapon arm, trying to disarm and disable him quickly."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is an AGI-based **Strike** action. The thug is a standard combatant with a 6-segment Resolve Clock. DC 16 (Tough—the thug is trained and alert).
>
> *Modifiers:*
> - +1 Edge from Dex's flanking setup
> - *Dim Light* would normally impose Burden, but Kira has low-light training (negated)
>
> *Roll:* With +1 Edge, Kira rolls 5d6 and keeps the best 4: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Keeping 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Adding AGI +2 = 20.
> *Margin:* 20 - 16 = +4.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) = **Clear Strike**.
>
> *Mechanical Result:* A Clear Strike ticks the target's Resolve Clock by 2 segments. The thug's Resolve Clock advances from 0/6 to 2/6.
>
> *Narrative Result:* Kira's blade connects cleanly with the thug's forearm. He grunts in pain and his grip loosens on his weapon. He is hurt and shaken but still fighting. Two more solid hits and he will go down.

> **Example - Skill Check with Edge and Burden Modifiers**
>
> *Scene:* Vance attempts to pick a locked door in the basement of a noble's estate. The environment is marked with *Dim Light* (Burden) and Vance is working with borrowed tools rather than his own precision set. However, an ally spent time earlier casing the lock mechanism, providing useful information.
>
> *Intent:* "I want to open this lock without triggering any alarms."
> *Approach:* "I work carefully, applying what Sera told me about the lock's design, and take my time to avoid mistakes."
>
> *GM Assessment:* This is an AGI-based Check using Technical Work Skill. The lock is high-quality. DC 18 (Hard—sophisticated lock in unfavorable conditions).
>
> *Modifiers:*
> - -1 Burden from *Dim Light* (impairs precision work)
> - -1 Burden from improvised tools (borrowed picks, not his custom set)
> - +1 Edge from Sera's reconnaissance (useful information about the mechanism)
> - Net modifier: +1 Edge + (-2 Burden) = -1 Burden total
>
> *Roll:* With -1 Burden, Vance rolls 5d6 and keeps the worst 4: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Keeping 1, 2, 4, 5 = 12. Adding AGI +3 and Technical Work +1 = 16.
> *Margin:* 16 - 18 = -2.
> *Outcome Tier:* **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2).
>
> *Narrative Result:* The lock clicks open—Vance's skill overcomes the poor conditions. However, the effort takes longer than expected, and one of his borrowed picks snaps inside the mechanism. He will need to explain the broken tool to its owner, and the damaged lock may be noticed when the household checks security in the morning. He is in, but evidence of his passage remains.

### Strike Outcomes

When you make a **Strike** action in combat, the outcome tier determines both the damage dealt and any additional effects. Strikes interact directly with target Resolve Clocks.

#### Strike Outcome Table

| Outcome Tier | Result | Resolve Clock Effect | Additional Consequences |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more) | Devastating Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 3 segments | Choose one: apply a relevant Condition (*Staggered*, *Bleeding*, *Disarmed*), gain immediate positioning for next action, or deny target their next reaction |
| **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) | Clear Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 2 segments | Clean hit with no complications; maintain your position |
| **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2) | Glancing Strike | Tick target Resolve Clock by 1 segment | Target may respond: GM ticks a threat Clock by 1 OR target gains minor positioning (chooses engagement distance, cover, etc.) |
| **Failure** (margin -3 to -6) | Miss | No Resolve Clock progress | GM chooses: tick a threat Clock by 1 segment OR target gains positioning advantage OR environmental complication |
| **Critical Failure** (margin -7 or worse) | Disastrous Miss | No Resolve Clock progress | GM chooses two consequences from the Failure list, OR one major consequence (weapon stuck, fall prone, ally endangered, etc.) |

> **Note**
> Threat Clocks represent dangers to the attacking character or their allies: "Reinforcements Arrive," "Escaping Target," "Collateral Damage," etc. The GM establishes relevant threat Clocks at the start of combat or introduces them as the situation develops.

#### Strike Mechanics Summary

- **Clear Strike** (Full Success): Your attack connects solidly. Tick the target's Resolve Clock by 2 segments. This is the baseline effective hit.
- **Glancing Strike** (Partial Success): You land a blow, but not cleanly. Tick the target's Resolve Clock by 1 segment. The target gains an opportunity: either a threat Clock advances, or the target improves their tactical position.
- **Miss** (Failure): Your attack fails to connect meaningfully. The target suffers no Resolve damage. Instead, the situation worsens for you: threat Clocks advance, the target repositions, or the environment becomes more dangerous.

> **Example - Strike Outcomes in Sequence**
>
> *Round 1:* Kira (Clear Strike) hits the thug for 2 Resolve ticks (now 2/6).
> *Round 2:* The thug attacks Kira. The GM rolls a Glancing Strike—Kira takes 1 Resolve tick, and the "Reinforcements Arrive" Clock ticks by 1 (the noise draws attention).
> *Round 3:* Kira attacks again but rolls a Miss. The thug takes no damage, but the GM ticks "Reinforcements Arrive" by 1 more—it is now 2/4. Kira must end this fight quickly.

### Group Checks and Assistance

Many actions involve more than one character. Rather than rolling for everyone separately every time, the GM can use:

- **Assistance**: One character leads the action, another assists. If the assistance is credible in the fiction, the leader gains Edge or a small bonus.
- **Representative Checks**: One Check stands in for a coordinated group effort. The outcome tier describes how the whole group fares.
- **Split Risks**: Two or more characters each roll, and the GM focuses on the most interesting combination of results rather than tracking every detail.

Pick the method that best fits the moment. Use single rolls when you want quick resolution. Use individual rolls when it is important that different characters face different consequences.

### Checks and Clocks

Some obstacles are too big for a single Check. Instead, the GM creates a **Clock** with several segments. Successful Checks tick the Clock forward; failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks.

Use Clocks when:

- Characters are working toward a long-term goal, such as investigating a mystery or repairing a ship.
- A danger is mounting over time, such as a collapsing tunnel, spreading fire, or advancing enemy force.
- Two or more forces are racing toward different outcomes (opposing Clocks).

> **Example - Clock and Checks**
> *Trigger:* The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.
> *Clocks:* "Evacuation Complete" (6 segments) and "Flood Waters Rise" (4 segments).
> *Rolls:* Each scene, characters make MIG, AGI, PRE, or RSN Checks based on their chosen contributions—lifting sandbags, coordinating crowds, analyzing routes. Successes advance the evacuation clock; failures or partials tick the flood clock or create new complications.
> *Outcome:* Which clock fills first determines whether the district is saved, partially saved, or overwhelmed.

### Keeping Momentum

Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt:

- Use Partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action.
- Let Failures create new problems, reveal information, or shift the situation rather than blocking all paths.
- Allow retries only when the circumstances or approach meaningfully change.

The goal is not to punish characters for rolling poorly. The goal is to discover what happens next when risk meets intent. If the table keeps that in view, Checks will feel like natural beats in the story rather than interruptions.

### Chapter Summary

Checks are the core resolution tool: declare intent and approach, assess whether a roll is needed, set DC and modifiers, roll 4d6, and interpret the outcome. **Having a relevant Skill adds +1 to your Check result**—this is a flat bonus with no levels or ranks. Edge and Burden adjust dice rather than targets. Outcome tiers—from Critical Success to Critical Failure—shape consequences with explicit margin ranges (+5 or more, 0 to +4, -1 to -2, -3 to -6, -7 or worse). Strike outcomes have specific mechanical effects: Clear Strikes tick Resolve Clocks by 2, Glancing Strikes by 1 with counterplay, and Misses advance threat Clocks or grant enemy positioning. The 4d6 system produces an average roll of 14, with each +1 modifier shifting success probability by 15-20%—use the probability tables to plan tactics and assess risk. Use the Check Procedure Summary and quick-reference tables during play to keep the action flowing.

## 9. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive. They connect description to mechanics so that rain, fear, injuries, crowds, and looming deadlines all matter at the table. This chapter explains what each of these tools is for, how to use them, and how they interact with Checks.

### When to Use What

Before diving into the details, use this quick-reference table to understand what each system does and when to reach for it:

> **When to Use What - Quick Reference**
>
> | System | What It Tracks | Who Controls It | Duration | Example |
> |--------|----------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
> | Tags | Scene elements and circumstances | GM sets, players can change | Until fiction changes | *Dim Light*, *Elevated* |
> | Conditions | Character states from events | Applied by outcomes | Until cleared by action/time | *Exhausted*, *Frightened* |
> | Clocks | Progress toward goals or threats | Ticked by successes/failures | Until filled | "Escape the Building" 6-segment |

### When NOT to Use These Systems

Before reaching for Tags, Conditions, or Clocks, consider whether the situation actually needs them. These tools should clarify play, not clutter it.

> **When NOT to Use - Quick Reference**
>
> **Skip Tags when:** The environment is unremarkable or will not affect any actions. A generic tavern during casual conversation does not need Tags unless something specific about the space matters to what characters are attempting. If no one is going to roll against the environment, you do not need to tag it.
>
> **Skip Conditions when:** The effect is momentary or purely fictional. If a character stumbles but immediately recovers, that is narrative color, not a Condition. Reserve Conditions for states that persist long enough to affect future Checks.
>
> **Skip Clocks when:** Progress is binary (succeed or fail) with no gradual buildup. A single locked door does not need a Clock—one successful Check opens it. Use Clocks when multiple efforts contribute toward (or against) an outcome over time.

### The Three Systems in Action

To see how Tags, Conditions, and Clocks work together without overlapping, consider this scenario:

> **Example - Three Systems, One Scene**
>
> A character sneaks through a guarded warehouse at night.
>
> **Tags describe the environment:**
> The scene has the Tags *Dim Light* and *Cluttered*. These belong to the space itself. *Dim Light* grants Edge on Stealth but imposes Burden on spotting details. *Cluttered* provides opportunities for cover but makes quick movement difficult. If someone turns on the lights, the *Dim Light* Tag disappears—Tags change when the fiction changes.
>
> **Conditions describe the character:**
> After failing a Stealth Check, the character gains the Condition *Spotted*. This follows them—even if they move to a different room, guards are now actively searching for them. The Condition imposes Burden on further Stealth attempts until they break line of sight and hide successfully.
>
> **Clocks track momentum:**
> Meanwhile, an "Alert Level" 4-segment Clock sits on the table. Each failed Check or loud action ticks it forward. When it fills, reinforcements arrive and the exits lock down. The Clock does not care about location or character state—it tracks the overall situation's trajectory toward a specific outcome.
>
> **Each system serves a different purpose:** Tags shape what is possible in this space. Conditions reflect what has happened to this character. Clocks measure how close the situation is to changing dramatically.

### Tags vs. Conditions

**Tags** describe **the environment or situation**. They belong to places, scenes, objects, or circumstances: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, *Crowded*, *Fragile Cover*. Tags affect what you can do in a space and how you do it.

**Conditions** describe **your character's state**. They follow you from one location to the next until cleared: *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*, *Frightened*, *Restrained*. Conditions affect your actions wherever you go.

Tags and Conditions are the shared vocabulary the table uses to talk about advantages, risks, and lingering consequences. They are not extra subsystems to memorize. They are the names you give to things you are already describing.

### What Tags Do

A Tag is a short descriptor applied to a scene, location, object, or situation. It becomes a flag: "remember this when resolving actions here." Tags typically:

- Grant Edge or impose Burden on certain Checks.
- Raise or lower DCs for specific actions.
- Change position or effect (how risky an action feels or how big its impact is).

You do not tag every detail. A room is just a room until its darkness, instability, crowd, or sacred significance matters to what characters are attempting. Tag the things that will shape decisions.

### GM Quick Start: Using Tags

When you are new to Tags or starting a scene quickly, use this approach to establish meaningful environmental details without overloading the table.

> **GM Quick Start: Using Tags**
>
> When starting a scene, establish 2-3 Tags that matter:
>
> 1. **One environmental Tag** (lighting, terrain, weather) - This grounds the physical space. Examples: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*.
>
> 2. **One situational Tag** (time pressure, social tension, hidden danger) - This establishes the stakes or atmosphere. Examples: *Tense*, *Surveillance*, *Hazardous*, *Chaotic*.
>
> 3. **Let players discover or create additional Tags through play** - When a character searches for cover, describes using the environment, or asks "is there anything I can use?", that is your opportunity to add Tags organically.
>
> **Why this works:** Two or three Tags give the scene texture without overwhelming anyone. Players know what matters. You have clear mechanical touchstones. Additional Tags emerge naturally from player curiosity and action.

### Tag Effects Quick Reference

Tags translate fictional circumstances into mechanical modifiers. Use this table to determine how Tags affect Checks:

> **Tag Effects Quick Reference**
>
> | Tag Type | Mechanical Effect | Examples |
> |----------|-------------------|----------|
> | Helpful Tags | Grant Edge on relevant Checks | *Elevated* grants Edge on ranged attacks from above; *Solid Cover* grants Edge on defense |
> | Hindering Tags | Impose Burden on relevant Checks | *Dim Light* imposes Burden on sight-based Checks; *Slick* imposes Burden on movement |
> | DC-Shifting Tags | Adjust DC by 2-4 for specific actions | *Reinforced* increases DC by 2-4 for breaking through; *Exposed* decreases DC by 2 for attacks against targets in the area |
> | Dual-Effect Tags | Grant Edge on some actions, impose Burden on others | *Dim Light* grants Edge on Stealth, imposes Burden on sight-based Checks; *Cramped* grants Edge on grappling, imposes Burden on wide swings |

### How Tags Affect Checks

Tags translate fictional circumstances into mechanical modifiers. When a Tag is relevant to a Check, it grants Edge or imposes Burden based on whether the circumstance helps or hinders the action.

**The Basic Rule:** If a Tag makes an action easier, it grants Edge. If a Tag makes an action harder, it imposes Burden. Some Tags do both depending on what you are attempting.

> **Common Tag Effects**
>
> | Tag | Grants Edge On | Imposes Burden On |
> |-----|----------------|-------------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Stealth, hiding, ambush | Sight-based Checks, ranged attacks at distance, reading or fine work |
> | *Slick* | Sliding into cover, pushing opponents | Movement, balance, standing quickly, pursuit |
> | *Elevated* | Ranged attacks from above, surveying area | Being targeted from below (opponents get Edge), climbing down under pressure |
> | *Cramped* | Fighting with short weapons, grappling | Wide swings, large weapons, group coordination |
> | *Chaotic* | Misdirection, blending in, escaping notice | Coordination, communication, finding specific people |
> | *Formal* | Proper etiquette, official requests | Informal approaches, casual conversation, blending in without credentials |

When multiple Tags apply, combine their effects. If one Tag grants Edge and another imposes Burden on the same Check, they cancel out. If two Tags both grant Edge, you gain +2 Edge (capped at the normal maximum). The GM adjudicates edge cases based on the fiction.

> **Note**
> Not every Tag affects every Check. A *Dim Light* Tag has no bearing on a Persuasion attempt unless visibility is specifically relevant to the conversation. Apply Tags when they logically matter.

### Common Tags Quick Reference

> **Common Tags Quick Reference**
>
> Use this table during play to quickly identify how Tags affect actions.
>
> **Environmental Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Burden on vision-based actions; Edge on Stealth | Dusk, candlelight, fog, shuttered windows |
> | *Darkness* | Severe Burden or impossible for sight-based tasks | Night without light sources, underground |
> | *Slick* | Burden on movement and balance Checks | Rain, ice, oil spills, wet stone |
> | *Cramped* | Burden on wide swings and large movements | Narrow passages, crowded rooms, tunnels |
> | *Elevated* | Edge on ranged attacks from above; risk of falling | Rooftops, balconies, cliff edges |
> | *Solid Cover* | Edge on defense; blocks line of sight | Stone walls, heavy furniture, vehicles |
> | *Fragile Cover* | Limited protection; can be destroyed | Wooden crates, thin walls, market stalls |
> | *Unstable* | Risk of collapse; Burden on careful actions | Old bridges, crumbling floors, scaffolding |
>
> **Situational Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Outnumbered* | Burden on defense; enemies gang up | Multiple foes vs. fewer defenders |
> | *Flanked* | Burden on defense against flanking attacks | Enemies on opposite sides |
> | *Surprised* | Cannot act in first round; Burden on initial reactions | Ambush, failed awareness Check |
> | *Exposed* | Burden on defense; easy target | No cover, caught in open ground |
> | *Hazardous* | Risk of harm from environment; ticks threat Clocks | Fire, toxic fumes, electrical danger |
> | *Surveillance* | Actions are observed and reported | Guards, cameras, informants nearby |
>
> **Atmospheric Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Tense* | Social missteps escalate quickly; Burden on calming actions | Standoffs, negotiations, high stakes |
> | *Chaotic* | Burden on coordination; opportunities for misdirection | Riots, battles, emergencies |
> | *Formal* | Burden on informal approaches; Edge for proper etiquette | Courts, ceremonies, official meetings |
> | *Suspicious* | Burden on trust-building; increased scrutiny | After crimes, with strangers, in enemy territory |

### Most-Used Tags Cheat Sheet

When you need an instant lookup during play, use this condensed table of the most common Tags:

> **Most-Used Tags Cheat Sheet**
>
> | Tag | Mechanical Effect | Example Use |
> |-----|-------------------|-------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Burden on sight-based Checks, Edge on Stealth | Night scenes, shadowy interiors |
> | *Elevated* | Edge on ranged attacks from above | Rooftops, balconies, high ground |
> | *Cover* | Burden to attacks against you | Behind walls, furniture, vehicles |
> | *Cramped* | Burden on large movements and wide swings | Tunnels, ducts, narrow alleys |
> | *Slippery* | Burden on movement Checks | Rain-slick streets, ice, oil spills |

You can invent new Tags that fit your setting. The important part is agreeing at the table what a Tag does in practice: which actions it helps, which it hinders, and how it shapes consequences.

> **Example - Tags in a Warehouse Fight**
> The GM describes a warehouse full of stacked crates, narrow aisles, and oil-spotted floors. They assign the Tags *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, and *Slick*.
> *Cramped* makes wide swings and large weapons awkward. *Fragile Cover* means wooden crates can be shredded by fire, potentially stripping cover away. *Slick* imposes Burden on fast movement or acrobatic maneuvers. Every decision in this scene now has texture.

### What Conditions Do

Conditions represent persistent states that modify what a character can safely attempt. They are the mechanical mark left by consequences. When something important happens to you—injury, fear, strain, affliction—it often becomes a Condition.

Conditions typically:

- Impose Burden on certain actions.
- Limit available options (cannot run, cannot act this turn, cannot speak clearly).
- Threaten further harm if ignored (ongoing damage, ticking Clocks).

### Condition Quick Reference

Use this table to quickly determine how common Conditions affect play:

> **Condition Quick Reference**
>
> | Condition | Mechanical Effect | Clearing Method | Example Source |
> |-----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
> | *Exhausted* | Burden on all physically demanding Checks (climbing, fighting, running) | Rest for at least one scene; receive meaningful aid or restorative treatment | Prolonged exertion, sleep deprivation, sustained hardship |
> | *Bleeding* | Tick a personal 4-segment "Bleed Out" Clock each scene if untreated; when filled, you fall unconscious | Stabilization Check (DC 14), medical treatment, or appropriate Proficiency | Serious wounds, failed combat Checks, environmental hazards |
> | *Frightened* | Burden on all Checks while the source of fear is visible or immediately threatening | Rally (successful PRE Check), escape the source, or defeat/neutralize the threat | Supernatural terror, overwhelming force, failed morale Check |
> | *Disarmed* | Cannot use your primary weapon; Burden on attacks until you recover it or draw another | Retrieve the weapon (action), draw a backup weapon, or disarm your opponent | Enemy maneuver, failed grapple, successful disarm action against you |
> | *Prone* | Burden on melee attacks and defense; Edge for enemies attacking you in melee; cannot move normally | Stand up (costs movement or minor action); an ally can help you up | Knocked down, tripped, diving for cover, failed balance Check |

Additional Conditions appear in the Extended Tags and Conditions Reference chapter. When you create custom Conditions, ensure each one has a clear mechanical effect and an achievable clearing method.

### Roleplaying Emotional and Psychological Conditions

Conditions affect more than dice rolls—they shape how your character acts, speaks, and moves. Use this table to bring emotional and psychological Conditions to life at the table:

> **Roleplaying Emotional and Psychological Conditions**
>
> | Condition | How to Portray |
> |-----------|----------------|
> | *Frightened* | Trembling hands and voice; avoiding direct eye contact with the source of fear; backing away or positioning allies between yourself and the threat; speaking in short, clipped sentences |
> | *Dazed* | Slow, delayed responses to questions; trailing off mid-sentence; blinking frequently or staring blankly; repeating words or losing track of conversations |
> | *Exhausted* | Heavy, labored breathing; leaning on walls, furniture, or allies for support; moving slowly and deliberately; speaking in a weary, flat tone |
> | *Shaken* | Nervous laughter at inappropriate moments; fidgeting with equipment or clothing; jumping at sudden sounds; over-explaining or rambling when speaking |
> | *Rattled* | Checking over your shoulder repeatedly; hesitating before acting; second-guessing decisions out loud; startling easily and reaching for weapons at minor provocations |

### Common Conditions Cheat Sheet

For fast reference during play, use this condensed table of the most frequent Conditions:

> **Common Conditions Cheat Sheet**
>
> | Condition | Effect | Cleared By |
> |-----------|--------|------------|
> | *Exhausted* | Burden on physical actions | Rest |
> | *Frightened* | Burden on actions toward source | Remove threat or calm |
> | *Bleeding* | Tick personal harm Clock each scene | Medical aid |
> | *Stunned* | Lose next action | Automatic next turn |

### Examples of Common Conditions

A full alphabetical list appears in the Glossary. Here are a few you will see often:

- **Exhausted** - Burden on demanding physical actions until you rest or receive meaningful aid.
- **Bleeding** - Time pressure from an untreated wound. If not stabilized, it ticks a personal Clock and escalates to worse states.
- **Restrained** - You are held or pinned. You cannot move freely and must break free or be helped.
- **Dazed** - Disoriented; Burden on perception and reaction until you recover.
- **Frightened** - Burden on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when you rally, escape, or defeat the source.

> **Example - From Event to Condition**
> A character fails a Check while crossing a compromised catwalk. Rather than simple damage, the GM describes how they slam into the railing and twist their knee. They gain the Condition *Exhausted* or *Weakened*, representing reduced stamina. Future physical actions are harder until they rest or receive treatment.

### Using Tags and Conditions with Checks

Tags and Conditions do not require new rules. They plug directly into the Check system:

- Tags grant Edge or impose Burden on Checks that interact with them.
- Conditions impose Burden or limit which approaches are reasonable.
- Some Tags shift DCs or change position and effect instead of modifying dice directly.

When you are about to roll, quickly review which Tags and Conditions are relevant. Ask: "Does this make the action easier, harder, or riskier?" Then adjust Edge/Burden, DC, or consequences accordingly.

> **Example - Tag and Condition Interaction**
> In a horror-tinged mystery, a character stalks through a foggy graveyard at night. The scene has Tags *Dim Light* and *Obscured*. The character is also *Frightened* from a previous encounter.
> When they attempt to sneak past patrolling figures, *Dim Light* and *Obscured* grant Edge on Stealth, but *Frightened* imposes Burden on actions taken while the threat is visible. The GM weighs these factors, cancels opposing modifiers as needed, and describes how the character's shaky nerves show up in the fiction.

### Introducing and Clearing Conditions

Conditions follow naturally from events. A failed Check in a hazardous area causes *Bleeding* or *Poisoned*. Exposure to overwhelming sights causes *Frightened*. Pushing beyond safe limits causes *Exhausted*.

When you introduce a Condition, state:

- What it represents in the fiction.
- How it affects actions (which Checks it modifies and how).
- How it can be cleared (time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock).

Minor Conditions clear quickly once addressed. Major Conditions persist across several scenes or form the basis for character-driven goals.

### What Clocks Are

Clocks are segmented trackers that answer "how close are we?" for goals and threats. A Clock is a circle or track divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments. As actions succeed, time passes, or events occur, segments fill. When the Clock completes, something happens.

> **What a Clock Looks Like**
>
> ```
>        ___________
>       /     |     \
>      /   2  |  3   \
>     |_______|_______|
>     |\\\\\\\|       |
>     | \\\1\\|   4   |
>      \_\\\\\_______/
>       \_____\_____/
>          6     5
> ```
>
> *A 6-segment Clock with 2 segments filled. Three more successful actions will complete it.*
>
> In practice, you can draw a Clock as a simple circle divided into pie slices. Fill segments by shading them in or marking them with an X. Many groups use index cards, dry-erase boards, or digital tools to track Clocks visibly at the table.

Use Clocks to represent:

- **Long-term goals** - Research projects, faction plans, character endeavors.
- **Mounting threats** - Approaching storms, advancing enemies, spreading plagues.
- **Ticking dangers** - Rituals completing, bombs counting down, collapsing structures.
- **Faction projects** - Off-screen activities of NPCs and organizations.

### The Progress/Pressure Pattern

One of the most powerful Clock structures is running two Clocks against each other: one tracking progress toward a goal, and one tracking a mounting threat or opposition. This dual-clock pattern creates natural tension because every action matters twice—success advances your goal while failure advances the threat.

> **The Progress/Pressure Pattern**
>
> **Progress Clock:** Tracks advancement toward what you want to achieve. Each successful Check ticks it forward. When it fills, you accomplish your goal.
>
> **Pressure Clock:** Tracks the opposition, danger, or consequence bearing down on you. Failures, loud actions, and time passing tick it forward. When it fills, the threat arrives or the opportunity closes.
>
> **Why this works:** The two Clocks create a race. You are not just trying to succeed—you are trying to succeed *before* the situation turns against you. Partial successes become agonizing choices: you made progress, but so did the threat.
>
> **Setting up the pattern:**
> 1. Create a Progress Clock sized to the complexity of the goal (6-segment for moderate challenges, 8-segment for major endeavors)
> 2. Create a Pressure Clock sized to how urgent the threat is (4-segment for immediate danger, 6-segment for looming consequences)
> 3. The shorter Clock creates more pressure—a 4-segment threat against a 6-segment goal means the threat is gaining ground
>
> **Example:** In the "Investigation vs. Cover-Up" scenario later in this chapter, the investigators race a 6-segment "Expose the Official" Clock against a 4-segment "Cover-Up Complete" Clock. The shorter threat Clock means every mistake costs dearly, and the official's counteractions can outpace careful investigation. This asymmetry drove the tension: the investigators needed more successes than the opposition, but had less margin for error.

### Clock Pacing Guide

Choosing the right Clock size and tick rate keeps scenes feeling appropriately tense. Use this guide to match Clock design to your scene type.

> **Clock Pacing Guide**
>
> | Scene Type | Recommended Clock Size | Tick Rate | Notes |
> |------------|------------------------|-----------|-------|
> | Tense negotiation | 4-segment | Tick on key moments | Each major concession, revelation, or misstep advances the Clock. Short Clocks keep social pressure high. |
> | Investigation | 6-segment | Tick on discoveries | Each clue found, witness interviewed, or lead followed advances the Clock. Moderate length allows for setbacks and red herrings. |
> | Dungeon or heist | 6-8 segment | Tick on major progress | Clearing rooms, bypassing obstacles, or reaching checkpoints advance the Clock. Longer Clocks sustain multi-scene tension. |
> | Campaign threat | 8-segment | Tick between sessions | Faction schemes, approaching disasters, or long-term countdowns advance during downtime. Slow burn maintains background pressure across multiple sessions. |
>
> **Adjusting on the fly:** If a Clock feels too fast, consider requiring multiple successes per tick. If it drags, tick an extra segment on Critical Successes or have time-based events push it forward.

### Clock Advancement Guide

Understanding when and how Clocks advance is crucial for pacing and tension. Use these guidelines:

> **Clock Advancement by Check Outcome**
>
> This table provides default tick rates. Specific actions, abilities, or circumstances override these defaults at GM discretion.
>
> | Check Outcome | Progress Clock | Threat/Opposing Clock | Notes |
> |---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
> | **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments | No advance | Exceptional progress; choose 3 segments for breakthrough moments |
> | **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments | No advance | Standard progress; use 2 segments for well-executed plans |
> | **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment | Ticks 1 segment | Progress with complication; the complication often manifests as threat Clock advancement |
> | **Failure** | No progress | Tick 1-2 segments | Setback; threat advances while goal stalls |
> | **Critical Failure** | No progress | Tick 2-3 segments | Serious setback; also introduces new Conditions or Tags |

> **GM Guidance - Clock Advancement Defaults**
> The table above establishes a mechanical baseline. Use it as your starting point, then adjust based on the fiction. A character with a relevant Proficiency ticks an extra segment on success. An action that is particularly risky or loud ticks threat Clocks even on success. The defaults ensure consistent pacing; your judgment ensures the fiction makes sense.

### Clock Advancement Cheat Sheet

For quick reference during play, use this at-a-glance summary:

> **Clock Advancement Cheat Sheet**
>
> | Outcome | Progress Clock | Threat Clock |
> |---------|----------------|--------------|
> | **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments | No advance |
> | **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments | No advance |
> | **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment + complication | Ticks 1 segment |
> | **Failure** | No progress | Tick 1-2 segments |

#### Multi-Clock Guidance

When multiple Clocks are active, use this decision process:

1. **Identify the primary Clock.** Ask: "Which Clock does this action most directly affect?" Advance that Clock based on the outcome.

2. **Consider secondary effects.** If the action is loud, risky, or draws attention, ask: "Does this also affect a threat Clock?" If yes, tick it.

3. **Handle ambiguous actions.** When an action could affect multiple Clocks:
   - If the player's intent was clear, honor that intent
   - If uncertain, advance the Clock most connected to their stated approach
   - For truly split actions, consider ticking both at reduced rates

> **Decision Flowchart: Which Clock Advances?**
>
> ```
> Action Taken
>     |
>     v
> Does the action directly target a specific Clock?
>     |
>     +-- YES -> Advance that Clock based on outcome
>     |         |
>     |         v
>     |    Was the action loud, risky, or attention-drawing?
>     |         |
>     |         +-- YES -> Also tick the most relevant threat Clock
>     |         +-- NO  -> Done
>     |
>     +-- NO -> Which Clock is most affected by this approach?
>              |
>              v
>         Advance that Clock; consider threat Clocks if failure occurred
> ```

### Advancing Clocks

Clocks advance in several ways:

- **Success-based** - Successful Checks tick a project Clock forward.
- **Time-based** - Segments fill as scenes pass or as in-world time moves.
- **Event-based** - Specific narrative events advance background or faction Clocks.

Partial successes advance a Clock and introduce a complication. Exceptional successes jump a Clock by more than one segment. Failures leave a Clock unchanged while pushing forward a related threat Clock.

### Opposing Clocks: A Worked Example

> **Example - Investigation vs. Cover-Up**
>
> The group is investigating a corrupt official while the official works to destroy evidence.
>
> **Clocks:**
> - "Expose the Official" - 6-segment Clock (investigation progress)
> - "Cover-Up Complete" - 4-segment Clock (enemy countermeasures)
>
> **Round 1:** The investigator searches the official's office.
> - *Check:* RSN-based Investigation against DC 16 (Tough—the office has been partially cleaned)
> - *Result:* Full Success (margin +2)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 2 segments. Found a ledger with suspicious entries.
> - *Threat Clock:* No advance—the search was quiet and unnoticed.
>
> **Round 2:** The investigator questions a nervous clerk.
> - *Check:* PRE-based Persuasion against DC 14 (Routine)
> - *Result:* Partial Success (margin -1)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 1 segment. Clerk reveals a name but is visibly frightened.
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 1 segment. The clerk will warn the official.
>
> **Round 3:** The official learns of the investigation and begins destroying documents.
> - *Event-based:* GM ticks "Cover-Up" 1 segment automatically (faction action).
> - "Cover-Up" now at 2/4 segments.
>
> **Round 4:** The investigator tries to intercept the document destruction.
> - *Check:* AGI-based Stealth against DC 16 (Tough—guards are alert)
> - *Result:* Failure (margin -4)
> - *Effect:* No progress on "Expose."
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 2 segments. Guards catch the investigator; documents are burned.
> - "Cover-Up" fills to 4/4—evidence destroyed!
>
> **Outcome:** The Cover-Up Clock filled first. The official escapes immediate exposure, but the investigator has partial evidence (3/6 on "Expose"). The story continues with new stakes: can they find other witnesses before the official silences them?

### Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

These tools are most powerful when used together:

- Tags set the stage: terrain, lighting, crowds, magical effects.
- Conditions show how previous events cling to characters and shape their options.
- Clocks track momentum toward outcomes that matter over time.

A single scene might involve a *Hazardous* Tag, characters who are *Exhausted*, and a "Structural Collapse" Clock. Every roll becomes a meaningful choice about risk, effort, and timing.

> **GM Guidance - Start Small**
> You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene. Start with one or two Tags that matter, a few Conditions that arise naturally, and a single important Clock. Add more only when they clarify the fiction rather than clutter it. When in doubt, ask: "Does this tool make the situation clearer and more interesting?" If yes, use it.

### Chapter Summary

Tags describe environments and situations; Conditions describe character states; Clocks track progress toward outcomes. The "When to Use What" table at the start of this chapter helps you quickly identify which system applies to a given situation. Equally important, the "When NOT to Use" guidance helps you avoid overcomplicating simple scenes. Use the Tag Effects Quick Reference to understand how different Tag types translate to mechanical effects: Helpful Tags grant Edge, Hindering Tags impose Burden, and DC-Shifting Tags adjust DC by 2-4. The Common Tags tables and Most-Used Tags Cheat Sheet provide quick reference during play. The Condition Quick Reference and Common Conditions Cheat Sheet provide mechanical effects and clearing methods for the most frequent Conditions. The Roleplaying Emotional and Psychological Conditions table helps you bring internal states to life through character behavior and mannerisms. Apply the Clock Advancement by Check Outcome table and the Clock Advancement Cheat Sheet to maintain consistent pacing—these defaults give you a mechanical baseline before applying GM judgment. The Progress/Pressure Pattern shows how racing two Clocks against each other creates natural tension: your Progress Clock tracks advancement toward your goal while the Pressure Clock tracks the opposition bearing down on you. The Clock Pacing Guide helps you size Clocks appropriately for different scene types. When multiple Clocks compete, let the fiction guide which advances. These tools work together to make the world feel responsive and stakes feel real.

## 10. Combat Basics

Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core combat actions to shape the fiction.

> **Combat at a Glance**
>
> Combat uses the same tools you already know, just focused on immediate danger:
>
> - **Same Check System:** Roll 4d6 + Attribute vs. DC, interpret outcome tiers
> - **Resolve Clocks:** Track pressure instead of hit points—when the Clock fills, someone is *taken out*
> - **Four Core Actions:** **Strike** (attack), **Maneuver** (reposition/control), **Set Up** (create advantage), **Defend/Withdraw** (protect/escape)
> - **Flexible Turn Order:** Choose conversational, popcorn, or rolled initiative to match scene tone
>
> | Outcome | Resolve Clock Ticks |
> |---------|---------------------|
> | **Critical Success** (+5 or more) | 3 ticks |
> | **Full Success** (0 to +4) | 2 ticks |
> | **Partial Success** (-1 to -2) | 1 tick |
> | **Failure** (-3 or worse) | 0 ticks |
>
> That is the entire combat system. Everything else is refinement.

If you are familiar with Hit Points from other games, think of Resolve Clocks as tracking momentum and composure rather than physical damage. A filled Clock does not mean death; it means the character can no longer continue fighting on their terms. They might flee, surrender, collapse from exhaustion, or be rendered helpless—the specific outcome depends on the stakes established at the start of the fight. This distinction matters: combat in this system ends when someone is *out*, not necessarily when they are dead.

> **The Key Question: What Does Taken Out Mean?**
>
> This single question unlocks the entire combat system.
>
> When a Resolve Clock fills, the character is *taken out*—but what that means depends entirely on the fiction and the stakes the table established before the fight began. "Taken out" is not a fixed mechanical state; it is a narrative outcome shaped by context.
>
> **Taken out might mean:**
> - **Killed** – in a lethal fight where death is on the table
> - **Knocked unconscious** – battered beyond the ability to continue
> - **Disarmed and helpless** – weapon lost, backed into a corner
> - **Convinced to surrender** – broken in spirit, not body
> - **Fled the scene** – self-preservation kicks in
> - **Captured** – subdued and restrained
> - **Exhausted** – too spent to fight but otherwise unharmed
>
> The same 6-segment Clock can represent wildly different outcomes depending on what the table agrees to at the start of the scene. A bar brawl might mean "first one knocked down loses." A duel to the death means exactly that. A hostage negotiation where you are "fighting" with words might mean "convinced to release the hostage."
>
> **Before any fight begins, ask:** "What happens when someone's Clock fills?" The answer shapes every action that follows.

### Combat as a Scene

Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does not call for "initiative" the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know who acts in what order and how threats respond.

The table can always ask, "Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?" Use structured turns when:

- Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.
- Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.
- Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.

Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration. Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate "combat mode."

### Resolve Instead of Hit Points

The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close someone is to being taken out of a fight.

- **Resolve Clocks** track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC (Vital Player Character—a significant NPC), or enemy can absorb before they are out of the scene.
- **Conditions** such as *Bleeding*, *Exhausted*, or *Stunned* mark lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.

When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your opponent's Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse, depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.

> **Why Resolve Clocks?**
>
> If you are coming from games with hit points, Resolve Clocks may feel unfamiliar. Here is why this system uses them:
>
> **Traditional HP:** A number that decreases. You ask "how many hit points left?" Combat becomes arithmetic—subtract damage, track totals, compare numbers.
>
> **Resolve Clocks:** Fictional pressure that increases. You ask "how close is this character to being taken out?" Combat becomes story—when do they falter, become desperate, finally break?
>
> | HP System | Resolve Clock System |
> |-----------|---------------------|
> | "The orc has 15 HP left" | "The orc's Clock is half full—he's getting desperate" |
> | "I deal 8 damage" | "Full Success on Strike—tick 2 segments" |
> | "He's at 0 HP, he dies" | "Clock fills—he flees, surrenders, or falls" |
> | Outcome is always depletion to zero | Outcome fits the stakes: defeat, capture, retreat |
> | Progress is hidden in numbers | Progress is visible: everyone sees the Clock filling |
>
> This keeps attention on narrative stakes rather than arithmetic, and lets different fights end in different ways.

#### Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?

Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:

- **Fiction first** – A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at "0 HP."
- **Visible progress** – A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.
- **Flexible stakes** – Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.
- **Pacing control** – The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick, cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.

Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and story rather than pure attrition.

#### Resolve Clock Sizing Guidelines

The size of a Resolve Clock determines how long an opponent can stay in the fight. Use these guidelines when setting up combat encounters:

| Clock Size | Threat Level | Examples |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| 4-segment | Minor threat | Lone minion, minor obstacle, fragile opponent |
| 6-segment | Standard threat | Trained combatant, dangerous beast, competent rival |
| 8-segment | Major threat | VPC antagonist, elite enemy, climactic foe |

For groups of minor enemies, consider using a single shared Resolve Clock rather than tracking individuals. A gang of four thugs might share a 6-segment Clock; when it fills, the survivors flee or surrender.

#### Resolve Clock Sizing Guide

Use this table to quickly determine appropriate Resolve Clock sizes based on enemy tier. Player characters typically use 6-segment Resolve Clocks.

| Enemy Tier | Clock Size | Typical Threats | Example |
|------------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Minion | 4-segment | Easily dispatched foes who fall quickly; rarely act alone | Single guard, street thug, wild animal, automated sentry |
| Standard | 6-segment | Competent opposition who pose real danger; the baseline threat | Trained soldier, experienced mercenary, dangerous predator, skilled rival |
| Elite | 8-segment | Dangerous foes who require coordination to defeat; often have tactical abilities | Veteran warrior, pack alpha, hardened assassin, war machine |
| Boss | 8-segment + special abilities | Major threats who anchor encounters; may have multiple phases or additional mechanics | Crime lord with guards, cult leader with ritual powers, apex predator with lair advantages |

> **Note**
> Boss-tier enemies often combine their 8-segment Clock with special abilities, environmental control, or supporting minions. The Clock alone does not make a boss dangerous—their fictional positioning and narrative weight do. When a boss Clock fills, the defeat should feel earned and significant.

---

### Reading Enemy Threat Levels

Before engaging, take a moment to assess what you are facing. Not all enemies are equal, and choosing the wrong target can turn a winnable fight into a disaster.

> **How to Assess Threats:**
>
> - **Clock size indicates staying power:** A 4-segment Clock means a fragile opponent who can be taken out quickly. A 6-segment Clock is a standard combatant who will require sustained effort. An 8-segment Clock signals a dangerous foe who will demand coordination and multiple rounds to defeat.
>
> - **Special abilities matter more than Clock size:** An enemy with a 4-segment Clock but the ability to *Stun* on hit or call reinforcements may be more dangerous than a straightforward 8-segment brute. Ask the GM what you can observe about enemy capabilities before committing.
>
> - **Position and Tags multiply threat:** An enemy with *Elevated* position and *Solid Cover* is significantly more dangerous than the same enemy standing in the open. A *Prone* enemy behind *Fragile Cover* is vulnerable. Read the battlefield before you read the enemy.
>
> - **Numbers matter:** Three minions with 4-segment Clocks who act before you may be more dangerous than one elite with an 8-segment Clock who acts after. If the minions can pile Conditions on you or fill your Resolve Clock before you respond, they are the priority—even if they seem "weaker" individually.

Use this assessment to prioritize targets. Taking out one enemy removes their actions from play entirely. Sometimes the tactically correct choice is to ignore the biggest threat and eliminate the minions first.

---

#### Resolve Clock Tick Rates

When your actions affect an opponent's Resolve Clock, use this table to determine how many segments to tick:

| Outcome | Ticks | Resolve Clock Effect |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more) | 3 | Devastating blow; major progress toward taking them out |
| **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4) | 2 | Solid hit; clear progress toward taking them out |
| **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2) | 1 | Glancing blow; you also suffer a cost or complication (counterblow, lost position, Condition) |
| **Failure** (margin -3 or worse) | 0 | Miss or ineffective; GM may tick a threat Clock against you or impose a Condition |

> **Note**
> These tick values are the baseline. The GM may adjust based on fictional positioning: exploiting a vulnerability might add +1 tick, while attacking through *Solid Cover* might reduce effect. The fiction always matters.

> **Example – Enemy Resolve**
> A dangerous VPC has a 6-segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of the fight in a way that fits the story.

Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.

Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what "taken out" means in this scene. Are you trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises about consequences.

### Turns and Order

Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach that fits the scene.

> **Turn Order Options**
>
> | Mode | Description |
> |------|-------------|
> | **Conversational** (default) | The GM asks "Who acts next?" and rotates the spotlight naturally—best for small skirmishes and narrative-focused scenes. |
> | **Popcorn** | After resolving your turn, you choose who goes next (ally or enemy)—creates dynamic, unpredictable flow. |
> | **Initiative Roll** | Each participant rolls AGI; act in order from highest to lowest—suits tactical set-pieces where precise timing matters. |

> **Initiative Options Quick Reference**
>
> | Mode | How It Works | Best For |
> |------|--------------|----------|
> | **Conversational** | GM asks "Who acts next?" and rotates spotlight naturally | Small skirmishes, narrative focus, simple fights |
> | **Popcorn** | After resolving your turn, you choose who goes next (ally or enemy) | Dynamic fights, unpredictable flow, keeping everyone engaged |
> | **Rolled** | Each participant rolls AGI or relevant Check; act in order from highest to lowest | Tactical set-pieces, when precise timing matters, competitive scenarios |
>
> **GM Tip: Match Initiative to Scene Tone**
> - *Tense standoffs* → Conversational (builds suspense, allows negotiation)
> - *Chaotic melees* → Popcorn (captures confusion, surprises everyone)
> - *Tactical ambushes* → Rolled (rewards preparation, clear sequence)

Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands who is up next.

> **Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order**
> A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, "We're in structured turns now," and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.

### Combat Round Procedure

When running structured combat, follow these seven steps for each character's turn. This procedure ensures clarity and keeps the action moving:

1. **Establish Turn Order** – Determine who acts next using your chosen initiative mode (conversational, popcorn, or rolled). Make it clear whose turn it is.

2. **Declare Intent and Approach** – The active character states what they want to accomplish (intent) and how they plan to do it (approach). Choose a core combat action: **Strike**, **Maneuver**, **Set Up**, or **Defend/Withdraw**.

3. **GM Sets DC and Modifiers** – The GM assesses the situation, considers relevant Tags, positioning, and opposition, then sets the DC (typically DC 12–20) and notes any Edge or Burden that applies.

4. **Resolve the Check** – Roll 4d6, add the relevant Attribute modifier, and apply Edge or Burden. Compare the result to the DC to determine the outcome tier.

5. **Apply Outcomes** – Based on the outcome tier, apply the appropriate effects:
   - Tick Resolve Clocks (see Tick Rates table)
   - Apply or remove Tags
   - Impose or clear Conditions
   - Grant or consume Edge for future actions

6. **Update the Fiction** – The GM narrates the result, describing how the scene changes. Describe the physical and emotional impact: does the opponent stagger, grow desperate, or stand firm?

7. **Move to Next Character** – Pass the spotlight to the next character in the turn order. In popcorn initiative, the current player chooses who goes next.

> **GM Guidance**
> Keep the procedure moving briskly. Steps 2–6 should take no more than a minute for routine actions. If a player hesitates on their intent, offer two or three concrete options to choose from. The goal is momentum, not deliberation.

### Combat Turn Checklist

Use this quick-reference during your turn to keep combat moving smoothly:

> **Your Turn at a Glance**
>
> | Step | What You Do |
> |------|-------------|
> | 1. Choose Action | Pick one: **Strike**, **Maneuver**, **Set Up**, or **Defend/Withdraw** |
> | 2. Declare Intent | State what you want to accomplish and how you approach it |
> | 3. GM Sets DC | GM considers Tags, position, and opposition to set DC and note Edge/Burden |
> | 4. Roll | Roll 4d6 + Attribute + Skill (+1 if applicable Skill applies) |
> | 5. Apply Outcome | Compare to DC, then apply effects to target's Resolve Clock or scene Tags |
>
> **Outcome Effects Summary:**
> - **Critical (+5+):** 3 Clock segments, possible bonus effect
> - **Full (0 to +4):** 2 Clock segments
> - **Partial (-1 to -2):** 1 Clock segment, plus a cost or complication
> - **Failure (-3-):** No progress; GM may tick a Clock against you

This checklist covers the essentials. When in doubt, describe what your character does in the fiction first, then work out the mechanics with your GM.

---

### Your Turn: Structure and Options

On your turn, you usually:

- Describe what you do in the fiction.
- Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).
- Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.

If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters, it often fits into the same turn.

Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.

### Core Combat Actions

Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:

- **Strike** – Directly attack a target.
- **Maneuver** – Change position, create openings, or control space.
- **Set Up** – Create Edge or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.
- **Defend / Withdraw** – Protect yourself or break contact to recover.

#### Action Types Quick Reference

Use this table for at-a-glance guidance on combat actions:

| Action | Primary Attribute | Typical DC | Full Success Effect | Partial Success Effect |
|--------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Strike** | MIG or AGI | DC 14–16 | Tick 2 segments on target's Resolve Clock | Tick 1 segment; suffer counterblow or cost |
| **Maneuver** | AGI or MIG | DC 14–16 | Apply Tag (*Prone*, *Exposed*) or remove enemy advantage | Create opening but become *Exposed* yourself |
| **Set Up** | PRE or RSN | DC 12–14 | Grant Edge to self or ally; create helpful Tag | Grant Edge but suffer positioning cost |
| **Defend** | AGI or MIG | DC 14 | Avoid incoming harm completely | Reduce harm but take lesser Condition |
| **Withdraw** | AGI | DC 12–14 | Break contact safely; reach cover or exit | Escape but leave ally exposed or drop item |

> **Note**
> The Attribute and DC shown are typical starting points. The GM adjusts based on your specific approach, the opposition, and environmental Tags. A clever approach that uses the environment might lower the DC; attacking a well-defended position might raise it.

---

### Tactical Decision Matrix

Use this quick reference when choosing your action. Match your current situation to the recommended response:

| Situation | Recommended Action | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| Enemy exposed, you have Edge | **Strike** | Maximize damage potential when conditions favor you |
| Enemy in cover, ally nearby | **Set Up** | Create Edge for your ally's Strike rather than waste yours against defense |
| Outnumbered or in poor position | **Maneuver** | Create or reach better position before committing to attacks |
| Low on your Resolve Clock | **Defend/Withdraw** | Protect yourself and reset the engagement on better terms |
| Enemy nearly out (Clock almost full) | **Strike** | Finish them before they can act again or escape |
| Enemy has dangerous special ability | **Maneuver** or **Set Up** | Disable or neutralize the threat before it triggers |
| Multiple enemies, one isolated | **Strike** (the isolated one) | Removing one enemy removes all their future actions |
| Strong enemy, weak allies nearby | **Set Up** | Your Edge transfer may enable an ally's critical hit |

> **Note**
> This matrix provides tactical starting points, not absolute rules. The fiction always matters—if the narrative suggests a different approach, follow it. But when you are uncertain what to do, this table points toward effective choices.

---

### Action Economy Tips

Understanding action economy—how to maximize the impact of each turn—separates adequate fighters from exceptional ones.

> **Key Principles:**
>
> - **Set Up + ally Strike often deals more total damage than two separate Strikes.** If your Strike has a 50% chance to hit and your ally's does too, two separate Strikes average one hit. But if you Set Up (granting Edge) and your ally Strikes with Edge, their success rate jumps significantly—often yielding better expected results than both of you swinging independently.
>
> - **Maneuver to gain Tags that persist across multiple turns.** A single Maneuver that grants you *Elevated* or puts an enemy in *Exposed* continues paying dividends every subsequent round. Compare this to a Strike that might miss entirely.
>
> - **Defend/Withdraw is not retreating—it is repositioning for advantage.** A strategic withdrawal to cover, to an ally's side, or to break a dangerous engagement is not cowardice. It is recognizing that survival lets you act again next round; being taken out does not.
>
> - **Focus fire: Eliminating one enemy removes their actions from play.** Three enemies each with 2 segments filled are still three enemies who will act next round. One enemy taken out and two untouched means only two enemies act. Always consider whether finishing a wounded enemy beats spreading damage.
>
> - **Conditions compound across turns.** An enemy with *Prone* and *Dazed* is dramatically easier to hit than one with neither. Stacking Conditions through Maneuvers before committing to Strikes can turn a difficult fight into a manageable one.

---

#### Strike

Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot, hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on your opponent's awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.

On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become *Exposed*, suffer a counterblow, or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your opponent a positional or narrative advantage.

Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you commit to repeated Strikes.

#### Maneuver

Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside a weapon.

Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can create *Prone*, strip *Solid Cover*, or apply a useful Tag such as *Exposed* that allies can exploit on later turns.

Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a rope bridge. In sci-fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single Strike.

#### Set Up

Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you grant Edge or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the opening but at some cost.

Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Edge you create.

As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher-tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better positions, cover, and Edge, Strikes become dramatically more effective.

#### Defend / Withdraw

Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover, blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition or yielding ground.

This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or surviving to fight another day.

Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it, the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from "win here" to "escape, regroup, or change the stakes." Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.

### Positioning and Environment

Tags play a major role in combat. *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*, *Fragile Cover*, *Slick*, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or change what is possible at all. Manage position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.

> **Example – Using the Battlefield**
> In a rooftop fight marked as *Elevated* with scattered *Fragile Cover*, one character uses Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting Edge on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats *Elevated* as granting Edge on ranged attacks from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.

---

### Reading the Battlefield

Tags are not just descriptive flavor—they are tactical tools. Understanding how to read and exploit environmental Tags separates competent fighters from exceptional ones. Before you act, scan the scene for Tags that might help or hinder you.

#### Common Combat Tags and Their Effects

| Tag | Tactical Effect | How to Exploit It |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|
| *Elevated* | Grants Edge on ranged attacks from high ground; imposes Burden on melee attackers below | Archers and snipers should claim high ground early; melee fighters should Maneuver to pull enemies down or find stairs |
| *Cover* (Solid or Fragile) | Provides Burden to attackers targeting you; *Fragile Cover* may be destroyed on Partial or Failed defense | Stay behind cover when possible; use Maneuvers to destroy enemy cover or flush them out |
| *Dim Light* | Imposes Burden on actions requiring clear sight; grants Edge on Stealth | Extinguish lights to aid escape; create light sources to reveal hidden enemies |
| *Cramped* | Limits movement options; may impose Burden on large weapons or sweeping attacks | Favor short weapons and grappling; use the space to prevent enemies from flanking |
| *Slick* / *Hazardous* | Imposes Burden on movement-based Checks; may cause Conditions on failure | Use Maneuvers to push enemies into hazardous terrain; be cautious when charging |
| *Exposed* | Grants Edge to attackers targeting someone with this Tag | Create *Exposed* through Maneuvers; capitalize on it with coordinated Strikes |

#### Reading Tags in Practice

When combat begins, ask yourself:

1. **What Tags favor me?** Can I reach high ground, use cover, or exploit dim light for stealth?
2. **What Tags threaten me?** Am I exposed? Is the terrain hazardous? Will my approach trigger Burden?
3. **What Tags can I change?** Can I create cover, destroy enemy advantages, or add new Tags through Maneuvers?

> **Example – Tactical Tag Use**
> The party enters a warehouse fight with these Tags: *Dim Light*, *Stacked Crates* (cover), *Elevated Catwalks*.
>
> - **Kira (melee fighter)** uses the *Dim Light* to close distance with Stealth, then Maneuvers to pull an enemy off the *Elevated Catwalk*.
> - **Varn (support)** climbs to the catwalk, gaining *Elevated* for his crossbow shots—Edge on ranged attacks.
> - **Rella (scout)** uses Set Up from behind *Stacked Crates*, calling out enemy positions to grant Edge to allies.
>
> By reading the battlefield, each character found Tags that amplified their strengths.

#### Changing the Battlefield

You are not limited to the Tags present at the start of a fight. Maneuvers can create new Tags or remove existing ones:

- **Create Cover:** Flip a table, collapse a shelf, or erect a barrier.
- **Remove Cover:** Destroy *Fragile Cover* with a Strike, set it ablaze, or pull it down.
- **Create Hazards:** Spill oil and ignite it (*Hazardous*), cut a steam pipe (*Scalding*), or shatter a window (*Glass Shards*).
- **Control Light:** Extinguish torches (*Dim Light*), smash lanterns, or activate emergency lighting.
- **Alter Terrain:** Create *Slick* surfaces with water or oil, clear debris to remove *Cramped*, or collapse supports to block paths.

The battlefield is not static. Fighters who actively shape the environment gain significant advantages over those who simply react to it.

---

### Conditions in Combat

Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being *Stunned* by a concussive blast, *Bleeding* after a severe hit, or *Suppressed* by incoming fire. These Conditions modify subsequent Checks and shape choices.

Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be cleared. For example, *Stunned* might end after you lose your next action, while *Exhausted* may persist until you rest between scenes.

Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both *Bleeding* and *Exhausted* is under pressure each round and rolling with Burden on many actions. Scenes like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.

### Worked Combat Examples

These examples show complete combat sequences with Resolve Clock progression, demonstrating how the system flows in practice.

---

#### Example 1: The Tense Duel

**Setup:** Kira, a skilled duelist (AGI 2, Brawling Skill), faces Varro, a rival enforcer. Both have 4-segment Resolve Clocks. The scene is a rain-slicked courtyard (*Slick* Tag). Stakes: first to be taken out loses the dispute.

**Round 1 – Varro Strikes First**
- Varro lunges with his blade. AGI Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 17).
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 2 segments (now 2/4). She staggers back.
- *Fiction:* The blade catches her arm—a shallow cut but a solid hit.

**Round 2 – Kira Sets Up**
- Kira circles, watching his footwork, looking for a pattern. Set Up action.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 16 vs. DC 14).
- *Effect:* Kira gains Edge on her next Strike. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* She notices he overextends on his lunges—she can exploit that.

**Round 3 – Kira Strikes**
- Using her Edge, Kira feints low and strikes high. AGI Check with +1 Edge.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 21 with 5d6 keep 4).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/4). He reels.
- *Fiction:* Her blade opens a gash on his shoulder. Blood mixes with rain.

**Round 4 – Varro Maneuvers Desperately**
- Desperate, Varro kicks at the slick ground, spraying water toward her eyes.
- *Result:* Partial Success (rolled 13 vs. DC 14, margin -1).
- *Effect:* Kira gains *Dazed* (Burden next round), but Varro is now *Exposed*.
- *Fiction:* Water stings her eyes, but his wild kick leaves him off-balance.

**Round 5 – Kira Finishes It**
- Despite being *Dazed* (Burden), Kira presses. He's *Exposed* (Edge cancels Burden).
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 15).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock fills (4/4). He's taken out.
- *Fiction:* She drives him back against the fountain. His blade clatters away. He yields.

**Outcome:** Kira wins with 2/4 on her Clock. Varro is defeated but alive—he'll remember this.

---

#### Example 2: The Group Fight

**Setup:** Three PCs (Kira, Varn, Rella) face four bandits in a warehouse. Tags: *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, *Dim Light*. Bandits share a 6-segment group Resolve Clock. Each PC has a 4-segment Clock. Stakes: subdue or drive off the bandits.

**Round 1 – Bandits Attack**
- Two bandits rush Kira. GM rolls a group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Partial Success.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 1 segment (1/4). She takes a glancing blow.
- Two bandits circle toward Varn and Rella but don't reach them yet.

**Round 2 – Kira Maneuvers**
- Kira shoves crates to create better cover for allies. MIG Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Allies now have *Solid Cover* against ranged attacks. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* Heavy crates screech across the floor, forming a barricade.

**Round 3 – Varn Sets Up**
- Varn calls out bandit positions and weak points. PRE-based Set Up vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Kira and Rella both gain Edge on their next actions.
- *Fiction:* "The big one favors his left leg—go for it!"

**Round 4 – Rella Strikes (with Edge)**
- Rella throws her lantern at the bandits' feet. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 16.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 18 with 5d6).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 2 segments (2/6). The area gains *Hazardous* Tag.
- *Fiction:* Oil splashes and ignites. Two bandits scramble back, singed.

**Round 5 – Bandits Retaliate**
- Remaining bandits attack Rella (nearest threat). Group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Failure (rolled 11).
- *Effect:* No Clock advance on Rella. She ducks behind cover.
- *Fiction:* Clubs swing wide as Rella drops flat.

**Round 6 – Kira Strikes (with Edge from Round 3)**
- Kira charges the big bandit, targeting his weak leg. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 20).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 3 segments (5/6). The big one goes down.
- *Fiction:* Her blade sweeps his leg. He crashes into crates and doesn't get up.

**Round 7 – Varn Negotiates**
- With their leader down, Varn calls for surrender. PRE Check vs. DC 12 (lowered—they're losing).
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock fills (6/6). They surrender.
- *Fiction:* "It's over! Drop your weapons or burn with the warehouse!"

**Outcome:** Bandits subdued. Kira has 1/4 on her Clock. No one else was seriously hurt. The *Hazardous* fire must be dealt with, but the fight is won.

#### Example 3: Cross-Genre Combat Encounter

The following example demonstrates the same combat structure across three different genre settings, showing how Tags, actions, and Clocks adapt to any fiction while the mechanics remain consistent.

---

**The Scenario:** A group of three characters must stop a dangerous opponent before they can complete a critical objective. The fight takes place in a confined space with environmental hazards.

---

**Fantasy Version: The Ritual Chamber**

**Scene Setup:**
- *Location:* A stone ritual chamber beneath an ancient temple
- *Tags:* *Dim Light* (torches flicker), *Arcane Circles* (magical hazard zones), *Crumbling Pillars* (destructible cover)
- *Combatants:* Three adventurers vs. a cult sorcerer (Elite, 8-segment Resolve Clock)
- *Stakes:* Stop the ritual before it completes; the sorcerer has a "Ritual Completion" Clock (4-segment) that advances each round

**Initiative:** Rolled AGI. Order: Sera (fighter), Sorcerer, Tomm (rogue), Wren (cleric).

**Round 1**

*Sera (Fighter) – Strike*
- Intent: Close distance and disrupt the sorcerer with a sword blow.
- Approach: Charges across the chamber, avoiding the *Arcane Circles*.
- Check: MIG-based Strike vs. DC 16 (sorcerer is alert, magical wards shimmer).
- Roll: 4d6 = 4, 4, 5, 6 = 19. MIG +2 = 21. Margin +5.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Sorcerer's Clock ticks 3 segments (3/8).
- Fiction: Sera's blade cuts through a ward, staggering the sorcerer mid-incantation. Sparks of disrupted magic scatter across the floor.

*Sorcerer – Maneuver + Ritual*
- The sorcerer gestures, and the *Arcane Circles* flare with energy.
- Check: RSN-based Maneuver vs. DC 14.
- Roll: Success. Sera gains the *Burning* Condition (Burden on physical actions until cleared).
- The "Ritual Completion" Clock ticks 1 segment (1/4).
- Fiction: Violet flames lick at Sera's legs. The chanting continues.

*Tomm (Rogue) – Set Up*
- Intent: Identify weak points in the sorcerer's defenses.
- Approach: Circles behind a *Crumbling Pillar*, watching the pattern of wards.
- Check: RSN-based Set Up vs. DC 14.
- Roll: 4d6 = 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. RSN +1 = 19. Margin +5.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Tomm gains Edge on his next action AND identifies a gap in the wards (creates *Exposed Flank* Tag on sorcerer).
- Fiction: "There! When he gestures left, his right side drops the ward for a heartbeat!"

*Wren (Cleric) – Maneuver*
- Intent: Suppress the ritual's power by disrupting the magical circles.
- Approach: Channels divine energy into the nearest circle.
- Check: PRE-based Maneuver vs. DC 16.
- Roll: 4d6 = 2, 3, 5, 6 = 16. PRE +2 = 18. Margin +2.
- Outcome: **Full Success**. One *Arcane Circle* is neutralized; area becomes safe to cross.
- Fiction: Holy light floods the circle, and the violet flames gutter and die. The sorcerer hisses in frustration.

**Round 2**

*Sera (Fighter) – Defend*
- Intent: Buy time while *Burning* by getting to cover.
- Approach: Rolls behind a pillar and smothers the flames.
- Check: AGI-based Defend vs. DC 14 (with Burden from *Burning*).
- Roll: 5d6 keep worst 4 = 2, 3, 3, 4 = 12. AGI +1 = 13. Margin -1.
- Outcome: **Partial Success**. *Burning* clears, but Sera is now *Prone* behind the pillar.
- Fiction: She rolls frantically, extinguishing the flames, but ends up flat on her back.

*Sorcerer – Strike*
- Targets Wren, who disrupted the circles.
- Check: RSN-based Strike vs. DC 14.
- Roll: Success. Wren's Clock ticks 2 segments (2/6).
- The "Ritual Completion" Clock ticks 1 segment (2/4).
- Fiction: A bolt of shadow slams into Wren's shoulder. She stumbles but keeps her feet.

*Tomm (Rogue) – Strike (with Edge and Exposed Flank)*
- Intent: Exploit the opening he identified.
- Approach: Darts from cover, striking during the ward gap.
- Check: AGI-based Strike vs. DC 14 with +1 Edge (from Set Up) and attacking *Exposed Flank*.
- Roll: 5d6 keep best 4 = 4, 5, 5, 6 = 20. AGI +2 = 22. Margin +8.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Sorcerer's Clock ticks 3 segments (6/8).
- Fiction: Tomm's dagger finds flesh. The sorcerer screams, concentration shattered. The ritual falters.

*Wren (Cleric) – Set Up*
- Intent: Bolster allies for the final push.
- Approach: Invokes a blessing of protection.
- Check: PRE-based Set Up vs. DC 12.
- Roll: 4d6 = 3, 4, 5, 5 = 17. PRE +2 = 19. Margin +7.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. All allies gain Edge on their next action.
- Fiction: Golden light settles over the group. "Finish this!"

**Round 3**

*Sera (Fighter) – Strike (with Edge)*
- Intent: End the fight before the ritual can resume.
- Approach: Rises from *Prone* and delivers a decisive blow.
- Note: Rising from *Prone* costs her Edge advantage but does not prevent the Strike.
- Check: MIG-based Strike vs. DC 14 (Edge consumed by rising).
- Roll: 4d6 = 4, 5, 5, 6 = 20. MIG +2 = 22. Margin +8.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Sorcerer's Clock fills (8/8). Taken out.
- Fiction: Sera's blade crashes through the last ward and into the sorcerer's staff, shattering it. He collapses, the ritual energy dissipating into harmless motes of light.

**Resolution:** The sorcerer is defeated with his Ritual Clock at 2/4—the party stopped him with rounds to spare. Wren has 2/6 on her Clock, Sera cleared her Condition but took a risk. The chamber is safe, but the cult will not forget this defeat.

**Sci-Fi Version: The Station Corridor**

**Scene Setup:**
- *Location:* A damaged corridor on an orbital station, emergency lighting only
- *Tags:* *Zero-G Pockets* (gravity fluctuates), *Sparking Conduits* (electrical hazard), *Vacuum Breach Nearby* (time pressure)
- *Combatants:* Three crew members vs. a rogue security drone (Elite, 8-segment Resolve Clock)
- *Stakes:* Disable the drone before it reaches the reactor; "Reactor Breach" Clock (6-segment) advances each round the drone is not stopped

**Initiative:** Rolled AGI. Order: Yuki (engineer), Drone, Marcus (medic), Zara (pilot).

**Round 1**

*Yuki (Engineer) – Set Up*
- Intent: Identify the drone's weak points using her technical knowledge.
- Approach: Scans with her diagnostic tool while taking cover.
- Check: RSN-based Set Up vs. DC 14.
- Roll: 4d6 = 4, 5, 5, 6 = 20. RSN +2 = 22. Margin +8.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Creates *Exposed Sensor Array* Tag on drone. All allies gain Edge against it.
- Fiction: "Its main sensor cluster is damaged—hit the left side and it can't track you!"

*Drone – Strike*
- Fires suppression rounds at the nearest target (Yuki).
- Check: AGI vs. DC 14.
- Roll: Full Success.
- Effect: Yuki's Clock ticks 2 segments (2/6). She gains *Suppressed* (Burden on movement).
- "Reactor Breach" Clock ticks 1 segment (1/6).
- Fiction: Rounds spark off the bulkhead. Yuki ducks, but fragments catch her arm.

*Marcus (Medic) – Maneuver*
- Intent: Use the *Zero-G Pockets* to flank the drone.
- Approach: Pushes off the wall, floating through a gravity null zone.
- Check: AGI-based Maneuver vs. DC 16 (zero-G is tricky).
- Roll: 4d6 = 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. AGI +1 = 19. Margin +3.
- Outcome: **Full Success**. Marcus gains *Flanking Position* Tag; removes drone's cover advantage.
- Fiction: Marcus floats silently through the null zone, coming up behind the drone's damaged side.

*Zara (Pilot) – Strike (with Edge from Exposed Sensor Array)*
- Intent: Disable the drone's movement systems.
- Approach: Fires her sidearm at the drone's leg actuators.
- Check: AGI-based Strike vs. DC 14 with +1 Edge.
- Roll: 5d6 keep best 4 = 4, 5, 5, 6 = 20. AGI +2 = 22. Margin +8.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Drone's Clock ticks 3 segments (3/8). It gains *Damaged Locomotion* (Burden on movement).
- Fiction: Sparks fly as the drone's left leg buckles. It staggers, recalibrating.

**Round 2**

*Yuki (Engineer) – Maneuver*
- Intent: Trigger the *Sparking Conduits* to create an EMP pulse.
- Approach: Reroutes power through the damaged systems.
- Check: RSN-based Maneuver vs. DC 18 (dangerous and complex).
- Roll: 4d6 = 3, 4, 5, 5 = 17. RSN +2 = 19. Margin +1.
- Outcome: **Full Success**. The corridor pulses with electromagnetic energy. Drone gains *Systems Disrupted* (loses next action).
- Fiction: "Everybody brace!" The lights surge, flicker, die. The drone's optics go dark momentarily.

*Drone – Disrupted*
- No action this round due to *Systems Disrupted*.
- "Reactor Breach" Clock ticks 1 segment (2/6).
- Fiction: The drone twitches, rebooting. Emergency systems kick in, but it is vulnerable.

*Marcus (Medic) – Strike (with Flanking Position)*
- Intent: Jam his medical laser into the exposed sensor array.
- Check: AGI-based Strike vs. DC 14 with +1 Edge (flanking).
- Roll: 5d6 keep best 4 = 4, 5, 6, 6 = 21. AGI +1 = 22. Margin +8.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Drone's Clock ticks 3 segments (6/8).
- Fiction: Marcus drives the laser into the sensor cluster. Optical fluid sprays across his visor.

*Zara (Pilot) – Strike*
- Intent: Finish it while it is blind.
- Check: AGI-based Strike vs. DC 12 (drone is *Systems Disrupted* and sensor-blind).
- Roll: 4d6 = 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. AGI +2 = 20. Margin +8.
- Outcome: **Critical Success**. Drone's Clock fills (8/8). Taken out.
- Fiction: Zara's shots punch through the drone's central processor. It collapses, servos whining down to silence.

**Resolution:** Drone disabled with the Reactor Breach Clock at only 2/6—plenty of time to seal the corridor and restore systems. Yuki has 2/6 on her Clock and is still *Suppressed*, but the immediate threat is over. The crew can now investigate why the drone went rogue.

---

**Cross-Genre Summary**

Notice how each version used the same mechanical structure:
- Scene setup with environmental Tags that created tactical opportunities
- Initiative establishing turn order
- Three to four rounds with varied action types (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw)
- Clock advancement tracking both enemy Resolve and external pressure (ritual, evidence, reactor)
- Combat resolution when the primary threat's Clock filled

The Tags changed (*Arcane Circles* vs. *Zero-G Pockets* vs. *Slick Floor*), the fiction changed (swords vs. fists vs. lasers), but the procedure remained consistent. This is the core strength of the system: learn it once, play it anywhere.

---

### Putting It Together

A typical combat turn might look like this:

1. The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.
1. You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.
1. The GM sets DC, notes any Edge/Burden, and clarifies stakes.
1. You roll **4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.
1. The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.

Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when Edge and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a series of disconnected attacks.

The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs, VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre-flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.

### Chapter Summary

Combat uses the same Check system as other scenes, focused through Resolve Clocks, core combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw), and environmental Tags. Use the **Combat at a Glance** box for a quick system overview. Reference the **Resolve Clock Tick Rates** table for concrete tick values (Critical = 3, Full = 2, Partial = 1, Failure = 0). Remember the key question: **What does taken out mean?**—the answer shapes every combat. Choose a turn order mode (Conversational, Popcorn, or Initiative Roll) that fits the scene tone. Use the **Combat Turn Checklist** for quick reference during play. Follow the seven-step Combat Round Procedure for structured fights. Reference the **Action Types Quick Reference** for at-a-glance guidance on your options. Consult **Reading the Battlefield** to exploit environmental Tags tactically. Use the **Tactical Decision Matrix** to choose optimal actions based on your situation. Apply **Action Economy Tips** to maximize the impact of each turn. Assess threats using the **Reading Enemy Threat Levels** guidance before engaging. The worked examples show how Clocks, Tags, and actions combine into dynamic fights with meaningful stakes.

## Style Guides

### content.md
# Content Style Guide

This guide defines the voice, tone, and structural conventions for all Razorweave content. Writers and editors should reference this document to ensure consistency across all chapters, supplements, and reference materials.

---

## Voice and Tone

### Second Person, Direct Address

Address the reader directly using "you" and "your." This creates an instructive, conversational tone that invites participation.

**Do:**
- "You roll when the GM calls for a Check."
- "Your character begins with a small set of equipment."
- "When you declare an action, you state two things."

**Avoid:**
- "Players roll when the GM calls for a Check."
- "Characters begin with a small set of equipment."
- "When declaring an action, state two things."

### Instructive but Not Prescriptive

Explain how the system works while leaving room for table interpretation. Present mechanics as tools, not mandates.

**Do:**
- "The GM can use conversational order, popcorn order, or initiative rolls depending on the scene."
- "You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths."

**Avoid:**
- "You must use popcorn order for all combat scenes."
- "Never change identity elements after character creation."

### Fiction-First Emphasis

Always ground mechanical explanations in narrative context. Lead with what happens in the story, then explain how the system supports it.

**Do:**
- "Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters."
- "A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain, the stakes matter to the story, and failure would move the scene forward."

**Avoid:**
- "Roll initiative at the start of combat."
- "Make a Check whenever attempting a difficult action."

---

## Terminology Consistency

Use these terms consistently throughout all content:

| Use This | Not This | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| GM | DM, Referee, Narrator | Game Master is the standard term |
| PC | Hero, Player, Adventurer | Player Character when referring to the character sheet entity |
| Check | Roll, Test, Attempt | The resolution mechanic is always called a Check |
| DC | TN, Target, Difficulty | Difficulty Class is the target number |
| VPC | Major NPC, Boss | Vital Player Character for significant non-player characters |
| Edge | Advantage, Bonus dice | The favorable circumstance modifier |
| Burden | Disadvantage, Penalty dice | The unfavorable circumstance modifier |
| Tag | Marker, Label, Status | Descriptors for environments and situations |
| Condition | Status effect, Debuff | Persistent character states |
| Clock | Progress track, Timer | Segmented trackers for goals and threats |
| Attribute | Stat, Ability score | The four core capabilities (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) |
| Skill | Ability, Talent | Action-based competencies |
| Proficiency | Expertise, Specialty | Domain knowledge and tool familiarity |

---

## Section Structure

### Standard Chapter Flow

Chapters should follow this general structure:

1. **Opening Hook** - A brief paragraph establishing what this chapter covers and why it matters to play
2. **Core Concept** - Clear explanation of the central idea or mechanic
3. **How It Works** - Step-by-step procedural guidance
4. **Examples** - Concrete illustrations using blockquote callouts
5. **GM Guidance** - Tips for running the content at the table (where applicable)
6. **Chapter Summary** - Brief recap of key points (for longer chapters)

### Section Openers

Begin major sections with a grounding statement that connects to the reader's experience or the broader system.

**Good opener:**
> "Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive."

**Weak opener:**
> "This section describes Tags."

### Transitions Between Sections

Use transitional sentences to connect sections and maintain reading flow.

**Example:**
> "The principles in this chapter describe how the table works together. The next chapter expands on these principles by showing how different modes of play shape the experience of the system."

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Active Voice

Prefer active constructions that clearly identify who performs the action.

**Do:**
- "The GM sets a Difficulty Class to represent how hard the task is."
- "Players describe what their characters attempt."

**Avoid:**
- "A Difficulty Class is set to represent task difficulty."
- "What characters attempt is described by players."

### Concise Sentences

Keep sentences focused on a single idea. Break complex explanations into multiple sentences.

**Do:**
> "Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt, use partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action."

**Avoid:**
> "Checks should move the story forward rather than stalling it, which means that when in doubt you should use partial successes to trade progress for cost because this keeps the action moving."

### Concrete Over Abstract

Use specific examples rather than abstract descriptions when explaining concepts.

**Do:**
> "A concept like 'retired scout with a guilty conscience' offers a clearer direction than simply 'fighter.'"

**Avoid:**
> "More specific concepts provide better direction than generic ones."

### Accessible Vocabulary

Write for readers who may be new to tabletop RPGs. Avoid jargon without explanation. Define terms on first use.

---

## Using Examples

### Example Blockquotes

Use blockquote callouts for examples. Format with a bold label followed by the example content.

```markdown
> **Example**
> A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous. The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character's choices matter. The GM calls for a Check.
```

### Example Types

- **Narrative examples** - Short fiction snippets showing the mechanic in play
- **Cross-genre examples** - Demonstrate how the same mechanic works across different settings
- **Counter-examples** - Show what does not trigger a rule or mechanic

### Example Labels

Use descriptive labels when an example illustrates a specific concept:

- `> **Example - When to Roll**`
- `> **Example - Intent and Approach**`
- `> **Example - Cross-Genre Check**`

---

## Writing Conventions

### Numbers

- Spell out numbers one through nine in prose: "choose three items," "roll four dice"
- Use numerals for 10 and above: "a 12-segment Clock," "DC 16"
- Always use numerals for game mechanics: "4d6," "DC 14," "+2 Edge"
- Use numerals in tables and stat blocks

### Lists

Use **numbered lists** for sequential procedures:
> 1. The player declares intent and approach.
> 2. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
> 3. The GM sets DC and notes modifiers.

Use **bulleted lists** for non-sequential items:
> - Environmental Tags
> - Situational Tags
> - Atmospheric Tags

### Emphasis

- Use **bold** for game terms on first significant use in a section
- Use **bold** for defined terms in explanatory text
- Use *italics* for Tag and Condition names: *Dim Light*, *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*
- Use *italics* for emphasis within sentences (sparingly)
- Avoid ALL CAPS for emphasis

### Contractions

Use contractions sparingly. They are acceptable in conversational passages but should be avoided in formal rule explanations.

**Acceptable:**
> "You don't need to memorize the entire book before you play."

**Preferred in rules text:**
> "You do not need to optimize your Skills."

---

## Callout Types

Use blockquote callouts consistently:

### Example Callout
```markdown
> **Example**
> [Example content here]
```

### GM Guidance Callout
```markdown
> **GM Guidance**
> [Advice for running the game]
```

### Note Callout
```markdown
> **Note**
> [Important clarification or reminder]
```

### Warning Callout
```markdown
> **Warning**
> [Caution about common mistakes or edge cases]
```

---

## Chapter Summary Pattern

End longer chapters with a summary section that:
1. Recaps the main concepts covered
2. Connects to upcoming content
3. Reinforces the fiction-first philosophy

**Example:**
> "Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the campaign. By moving from concept to identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, and goals, you build a character who feels grounded and ready for play. Later chapters explain how these elements interact with the core mechanics during sessions."

### formatting.md
# Formatting Style Guide

This guide defines markdown conventions, document structure, and visual formatting standards for all Razorweave content. Consistent formatting ensures readability across different rendering contexts and maintains professional presentation.

---

## Heading Conventions

### Heading Hierarchy

Use a strict heading hierarchy with no skipped levels:

| Level | Usage | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `#` (H1) | Chapter title only | `# 1. Welcome to the Game` |
| `##` (H2) | Major sections | `## When to Roll (and When Not To)` |
| `###` (H3) | Subsections | `### Declaring Intent and Approach` |
| `####` (H4) | Minor subsections | `#### Basic Gear Package` |

### Heading Rules

- **One H1 per document** - Each chapter file has exactly one H1 heading
- **Number chapter H1s** - Use format `# N. Chapter Title` for main chapters
- **Use H2 for section breaks** - Major topic changes use H2
- **Keep H4 usage minimal** - Prefer restructuring over deep nesting
- **No H5 or H6** - If you need H5, restructure the content

### Heading Formatting

- Use Title Case for all headings
- Do not end headings with punctuation (except question marks when appropriate)
- Keep headings concise (aim for 3-7 words)
- Avoid starting headings with articles (The, A, An)

**Do:**
```markdown
## Core Combat Actions
### Strike
### Maneuver
```

**Avoid:**
```markdown
## The Core Combat Actions.
### The Strike Action
### How to Maneuver:
```

---

## Blockquote Callouts

Use blockquotes with bold labels for callouts. This creates visually distinct sections for examples, guidance, and warnings.

### Example Callout

```markdown
> **Example**
> A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain.
> The GM calls for a Check because the outcome is uncertain and the stakes
> are serious.
```

Renders as:
> **Example**
> A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain.
> The GM calls for a Check because the outcome is uncertain and the stakes
> are serious.

### Labeled Example Callout

Use descriptive labels for complex examples:

```markdown
> **Example - Clock and Checks**
> *Trigger:* The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.
> *Clocks:* "Evacuation Complete" (6 segments) and "Flood Waters Rise" (4 segments).
> *Outcome:* Which clock fills first determines the district's fate.
```

### GM Guidance Callout

```markdown
> **GM Guidance**
> Start small. You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene.
> Add complexity only when it clarifies the fiction rather than cluttering it.
```

### Note Callout

```markdown
> **Note**
> Edge and Burden are capped at +/-2. Multiple sources combine into a single
> level and do not stack beyond the cap.
```

### Warning Callout

```markdown
> **Warning**
> Do not roll for actions without meaningful uncertainty. If failure just means
> "try again until it works," skip the Check.
```

### Callout Formatting Rules

- Start each callout with `> **Label**` on its own line
- Continue callout content with `>` prefix on each line
- Use single blank line before and after callouts
- Keep callouts focused on a single point or example
- For multi-paragraph callouts, use `>` with blank line between paragraphs

---

## Table Formatting

### Basic Table Structure

```markdown
| Column A | Column B | Column C |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
| Value 4  | Value 5  | Value 6  |
```

### Table Guidelines

- Use tables for reference data, comparisons, and structured information
- Keep tables simple - avoid complex nesting or merged cells
- Left-align text columns, right-align numeric columns
- Use consistent column widths within a table
- Provide a brief introduction before each table

### Game Reference Tables

For game mechanics tables, use this format:

```markdown
The system uses a standard difficulty ladder:

| DC | Difficulty |
|----|------------|
| 12 | Easy |
| 14 | Routine |
| 16 | Tough |
| 18 | Hard |
| 20 | Heroic |
| 22 | Legendary |
```

### Terminology Tables

For terminology reference:

```markdown
| Use This | Not This | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| GM | DM, Referee | Game Master is the standard term |
| Check | Roll, Test | The resolution mechanic |
```

---

## List Formatting

### Numbered Lists

Use for sequential steps or ordered procedures:

```markdown
1. The player declares intent and approach.
2. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
3. The GM sets DC and notes modifiers.
4. The player rolls 4d6 and compares to DC.
5. The table interprets the outcome tier.
```

### Bulleted Lists

Use for non-sequential items, options, or features:

```markdown
- **Environmental Tags** - Physical features of space
- **Situational Tags** - Circumstances and pressures
- **Atmospheric Tags** - Social or emotional tone
```

### Nested Lists

Limit nesting to one level. Restructure if deeper nesting is needed:

```markdown
- **Strike** - Directly attack a target.
  - Use when you want to advance an opponent's Resolve Clock
  - Requires a clear line of action to the target
- **Maneuver** - Change position or create openings.
  - Use to apply Tags like *Exposed* or *Prone*
  - Works well before committing to Strikes
```

### List Item Formatting

- Use sentence case for list items
- End list items with periods if they are complete sentences
- Omit periods for short phrase items
- Be consistent within each list
- Use bold for defined terms at the start of list items

---

## Emphasis Formatting

### Bold Text

Use **bold** for:
- Game terms on first significant use: **Difficulty Class (DC)**
- Key concepts being defined: **Intent** and **Approach**
- Labels in lists and callouts: **Strike**, **Maneuver**
- Table headers and column labels

### Italic Text

Use *italics* for:
- Tag names: *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*
- Condition names: *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*, *Frightened*
- Emphasis within sentences (use sparingly)
- Titles of works or publications

### Combined Bold and Italic

Use ***bold italic*** only for:
- Critical warnings or important notes (extremely rare)

### Formatting to Avoid

- ALL CAPS for emphasis (never use)
- Underline (not supported in standard markdown)
- Strikethrough (only for errata or corrections)
- Excessive emphasis (if everything is bold, nothing stands out)

---

## Code Block Usage

### Inline Code

Use backticks for:
- Dice notation in technical contexts: `4d6`, `2d6+3`
- File names and paths: `chapter-08.md`
- Specific numeric values in formulas: `DC = 14 + modifier`

### Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks for:
- Extended examples of markdown formatting
- Technical syntax demonstrations
- Multi-line formulas or procedures

```markdown
​```markdown
> **Example**
> Your example content here.
​```
```

**Avoid** using code blocks for:
- Regular prose or rules text
- Examples that should use blockquote callouts
- In-fiction dialogue or narration

---

## Cross-Reference Conventions

### Internal References

Reference other chapters and sections clearly:

```markdown
See Chapter 8: Actions, Checks, and Outcomes for the full procedure.
```

```markdown
The Tags described in Chapter 9 provide modifiers for these Checks.
```

### Section References

When referencing sections within the same chapter:

```markdown
As described in the Core Check Procedure above, every Check follows
the same basic loop.
```

### Forward References

When content depends on later chapters:

```markdown
Later chapters describe Skills in more detail and provide example
lists grouped by Attribute.
```

### Reference Formatting

- Use chapter numbers when referencing other chapters
- Use section names when referencing within the same chapter
- Avoid page numbers (not stable across formats)
- Keep references natural within prose flow

## Game Term Formatting

### Term Formatting Table

| Term Type | Format | Examples |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Dice notation | Plain text, no spaces | 4d6, 2d6+3, 1d8-1 |
| Difficulty Class | DC + space + number | DC 12, DC 16, DC 20 |
| Attributes | Bold on first use, then plain | **Might (MIG)**, then MIG or Might |
| Attribute abbreviations | ALL CAPS | MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN |
| Tags | Italic | *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated* |
| Conditions | Italic | *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*, *Frightened* |
| Skills | Plain text, capitalized | Stealth, Observation, Technical Work |
| Proficiencies | Plain text, capitalized | Telegraph Instruments, Precision Tools |
| Edge/Burden | Bold when defined, plain after | **Edge**, **Burden**, then Edge, Burden |
| Clock names | Quoted, Title Case | "Evacuation Complete" Clock |
| Clock segments | Numeral + hyphen + segment | 6-segment Clock, 4-segment Clock |
| Outcome tiers | Bold | **Full Success**, **Partial Success** |
| Actions | Bold | **Strike**, **Maneuver**, **Set Up** |

### Inline Mechanical References

When referencing mechanics inline:

**Do:**
- "Make a Check against DC 14."
- "Roll 4d6 and add your Agility."
- "The *Exhausted* Condition imposes Burden."
- "A 6-segment Clock tracks progress."

**Avoid:**
- "Make a check against difficulty 14."
- "Roll four six-sided dice and add agility."
- "The Exhausted condition imposes burden."
- "A six segment clock tracks progress."

---

## Dice Notation Standards

### Basic Notation

| Format | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| NdX | Roll N dice with X sides | 4d6 = roll 4 six-sided dice |
| NdX+M | Roll NdX, add M to total | 2d6+3 = roll 2d6, add 3 |
| NdX-M | Roll NdX, subtract M from total | 1d8-1 = roll 1d8, subtract 1 |

### Edge and Burden Notation

| Modifier | Notation | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| +1 Edge | Roll 5d6, keep best 4 | Add one die, drop lowest |
| +2 Edge | Roll 6d6, keep best 4 | Add two dice, drop two lowest |
| -1 Burden | Roll 5d6, keep worst 4 | Add one die, drop highest |
| -2 Burden | Roll 6d6, keep worst 4 | Add two dice, drop two highest |

### Writing About Dice

When explaining dice mechanics in prose:

**Do:**
> "Roll **4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare the total to the DC."

> "With +1 Edge, roll 5d6 and keep the best 4 dice."

**Avoid:**
> "Roll four six-sided dice."

> "With advantage, roll an extra die and drop the lowest."

### Dice in Examples

In examples, show the full mechanical sequence:

> **Example - Calculating Margin**
> The DC is 16. You roll 4d6 and get 3, 4, 5, 6 for a total of 18.
> Your Attribute adds +2, bringing your result to 20.
> Margin = 20 - 16 = +4, which is a **Full Success**.

## Difficulty Class Standards

### Standard DC Ladder

Always use this ladder consistently:

| DC | Difficulty Level | When to Use |
|----|------------------|-------------|
| 12 | Easy | Favorable conditions, strong positioning |
| 14 | Routine | Standard conditions, typical challenges |
| 16 | Tough | Unfavorable conditions, skilled opposition |
| 18 | Hard | Hostile conditions, significant obstacles |
| 20 | Heroic | Extreme conditions, exceptional challenges |
| 22 | Legendary | Near-impossible, setting-defining moments |

### DC in Prose

Reference DCs naturally:

**Do:**
> "The GM sets a DC of 16 for the tough climb."
> "Against DC 14, this is a Routine task."

**Avoid:**
> "The GM sets difficulty at sixteen."
> "This is difficulty class 14."

### When to Specify DC

- Always specify DC when showing example Checks
- Specify DC ranges when discussing task categories
- Use descriptive terms (Easy, Routine, Tough) alongside numbers

---

## Rules Text Patterns

### Check Format

When describing a Check in rules text, use this pattern:

```
[Situation] → [Attribute]-based Check → [DC/difficulty] → [Outcome interpretation]
```

**Example:**
> When a character attempts to calm a frightened NPC, the GM calls for a PRE-based Check. Against DC 14, a **Full Success** calms the NPC completely. A **Partial Success** calms them but creates an obligation. **Failure** spreads the panic further.

### Outcome Format

Present outcome tiers in a consistent order:

1. **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more)
2. **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4)
3. **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2)
4. **Failure** (margin -3 to -6)
5. **Critical Failure** (margin -7 or worse, or all 1s)

When space is limited, you may omit Critical tiers and focus on Full/Partial/Failure.

### Tag Application Pattern

When describing how Tags apply:

```
[Tag name] + [mechanical effect] + [fictional context]
```

**Example:**
> *Dim Light* imposes Burden on actions requiring clear sight but grants Edge on Stealth attempts. Characters can use light sources to remove this Tag from their immediate area.

### Condition Application Pattern

When describing how Conditions work:

```
[Condition name] + [source] + [effect] + [clearing method]
```

**Example:**
> **Exhausted** - Acquired through overexertion or sustained hardship. Imposes Burden on demanding physical actions. Clears after meaningful rest or appropriate aid.

## Clock Mechanics Documentation

### Clock Sizes

Use standard clock sizes:

| Segments | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| 4-segment | Quick threats, minor goals, time pressure |
| 6-segment | Standard projects, moderate obstacles |
| 8-segment | Major endeavors, significant threats |

### Clock Notation

Write clock references consistently:

**Do:**
- "Create a 6-segment 'Investigation' Clock."
- "The 'Flood Waters Rise' Clock has 4 segments."
- "Tick the Clock forward by 2 segments."

**Avoid:**
- "Create a six segment investigation clock."
- "The flood waters rise clock has four segments."
- "Advance the clock two segments."

### Clock Advancement

Document clock advancement clearly:

| Result | Clock Effect |
|--------|--------------|
| **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments |
| **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments |
| **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment, plus complication |
| **Failure** | No progress, may tick threat Clock |

### Opposing Clocks

When documenting racing clocks:

> **Example - Opposing Clocks**
> The group investigates a corrupt official while the official works to cover their tracks.
> - "Expose the Official" - 6-segment Clock (investigation progress)
> - "Cover-Up" - 4-segment Clock (enemy countermeasures)
>
> Successful investigation Checks advance the first Clock. Failures, loud approaches, or conspicuous actions advance the second. Which Clock fills first determines the outcome.

## Example Patterns

### Combat Example Pattern

```markdown
> **Example - [Combat Concept]**
> [Scene setup with relevant Tags]
> [Character action and intent]
> [Check details: Attribute, DC, modifiers]
> [Outcome and fictional result]
> [Clock or Condition changes if applicable]
```

**Full Example:**
> **Example - Strike Action**
> In a rooftop fight marked *Elevated* with *Fragile Cover*, Kira attempts to disarm her opponent with a quick strike to their weapon arm.
>
> The GM calls for an AGI-based Check against DC 16. Kira has +1 Edge from flanking established by an ally's Set Up.
>
> She rolls 5d6 (keeping best 4): 2, 3, 5, 5, 6. Keeping 3, 5, 5, 6 = 19. With AGI +1, her total is 20. Margin = +4, a **Full Success**.
>
> The opponent's weapon clatters across the rooftop. The GM ticks 2 segments on their Resolve Clock and applies the *Disarmed* Tag.

### Skill Check Example Pattern

```markdown
> **Example - [Skill Check Type]**
> *Trigger:* [What prompts the Check]
> *Assessment:* [Why a Check is appropriate]
> *Roll:* [Mechanical details]
> *Consequence:* [Outcome by tier]
```

**Full Example:**
> **Example - Social Influence**
> *Trigger:* A character wants to convince the factory foreman to delay shipment of suspicious crates.
>
> *Assessment:* The outcome is uncertain (the foreman has orders), consequential (the shipment contains evidence), and within the character's influence (they have documentation of safety violations).
>
> *Roll:* PRE-based Check against DC 14 (Routine social situation) with potential Edge from the documentation.
>
> *Consequence:* **Full Success** - the foreman agrees and becomes a potential ally. **Partial Success** - the foreman delays but demands a personal favor in return. **Failure** - the foreman refuses and reports the inquiry to management.

## Consistency Rules

### Define Before Use

Always define game terms before using them in complex explanations:

**Do:**
> **Edge** grants favorable dice. When you have Edge, roll additional dice and keep the best results. With +1 Edge, roll 5d6 and keep the best 4.

**Avoid:**
> Roll with Edge to improve your chances. Edge means rolling extra dice.

### DC Range Consistency

Always use the standard DC values. Do not invent intermediate values:

**Do:** DC 12, DC 14, DC 16, DC 18, DC 20, DC 22

**Avoid:** DC 13, DC 15, DC 17, DC 19

### Clock Size Consistency

Use standard clock sizes. Do not use non-standard segments:

**Do:** 4-segment, 6-segment, 8-segment

**Avoid:** 3-segment, 5-segment, 7-segment, 10-segment

### Attribute Reference Consistency

When referencing Attributes:

- First mention: **Might (MIG)**, **Agility (AGI)**, **Presence (PRE)**, **Reason (RSN)**
- Subsequent mentions: Use either full name or abbreviation consistently within a section
- In mechanical notation: Use abbreviations (MIG-based Check, PRE roll)

### Tag and Condition Consistency

- Always italicize Tag and Condition names
- Use Title Case: *Dim Light*, *Fragile Cover*, *Exhausted*
- Be consistent with Tag naming: *Elevated* not *High Ground* (unless both are defined)
