## 6. Character Creation

Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule before you start. This chapter guides you step by step and tells you when to reference later chapters for details.

> **Quick-Start: 10-Minute Character**
>
> Need a character fast? Use this streamlined path for one-shots or time-pressed sessions:
>
> 1. **Concept in one sentence:** "A [role/background] who [defining trait or goal]."
> 2. **Attributes:** Use the standard array: 2 in your primary, 1 in two others, 0 in one.
> 3. **Skills:** Pick 3 from the Suggested Skills list below.
> 4. **Proficiencies:** Pick 2 from the Suggested Proficiencies list below.
> 5. **Gear:** Choose clothing, a backpack, and 2-3 items that fit your concept.
>
> You now have a playable character. Fill in name, background, and goals as you play. Return to the full chapter later to add depth.

### Learning by Example

Some players prefer to see a full character before reading detailed steps. If you want to follow a character build from start to finish, you can skip ahead to the Example Characters section later in this chapter and return to each step as needed.

### The Creation Flow

Character Creation follows a clear sequence. You begin with story driven questions, then add mechanical structure, then return to fiction to finalize your concept. Each step builds on the previous one.

1. Step One: Choose a Concept
1. Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements
1. Step Three: Assign Attributes
1. Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies
1. Step Four: Choose Skills
1. Step Five: Choose Proficiencies
1. Step Six: Determine Starting Gear
1. Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships
1. Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads
1. Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit

### Step One: Choose a Concept

Every character begins with a concept. A concept is the short answer to the question, who is this person. It is the foundation for every choice you make later in the process. The concept does not depend on mechanics. It does not require a long backstory. It is a clean expression of identity, role, and theme.

Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for discovery. A concept like retired scout with a guilty conscience offers a clearer direction than simply fighter. The first concept suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world. The second is mostly a job title.

> **Example**
> A player chooses the concept former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns. This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours, delicate tools, and unanswered questions.

Your concept should tell you what kind of scenes you want to be in, what skills you might have learned, and what challenges might matter to you. If you feel stuck, talk with the GM and the other players. The group can help you find a concept that fits the tone of the campaign.

### Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements

Identity elements are the personal details that give your character depth. They are the details that help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at once. The goal is to add enough information that the character feels real.

Useful identity elements include:

- Name and pronouns
- Origin or home environment
- Everyday role or profession before the story begins
- Notable habits and mannerisms
- First impressions and social style
- One or two key experiences that shaped them

These details are most helpful when they connect to your concept. If your concept involves quiet work and technical skill, identity elements that reflect that focus will make the character feel grounded.

> **Example**
> The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.

You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character. For now, capture the parts that feel most important.

### Step Three: Assign Attributes

Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character tends to approach challenges when there is no time to prepare a careful strategy. Attributes are not personality traits. They are expressions of how your character acts when the moment demands action.

The system uses four Attributes:

- **Might (MIG)**: Physical strength, force, and raw endurance.
- **Agility (AGI)**: Balance, coordination, stealth, and quick reaction.
- **Presence (PRE)**: Social force, confidence, emotional expression, and leadership.
- **Reason (RSN)**: Logic, analysis, memory, and structured thinking.

New characters begin with the following Attribute spread.

- One Attribute at 2
- Two Attributes at 1
- One Attribute at 0

No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability. Characters begin competent but not exceptional in every area. As the campaign progresses, advancement rules will allow Attributes to grow.

Assign these values based on your concept and identity elements. Ask yourself which Attribute your character relies on most often, which areas they find challenging, and which weaknesses might create interesting story moments.

> **Example**
> Rella is analytical and steady. Her player chooses Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0. This emphasizes her careful thinking, modest coordination, quiet presence, and relative physical weakness.

### Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies

This system does not rely on a fixed or exhaustive list of Skills or Proficiencies. The rulebook provides examples and frameworks, but players are encouraged to work with their GM to define custom entries that reflect their character's experiences, training, and background.

Skills and Proficiencies serve different purposes.

- **Skills** are action based competencies. They are used directly in Checks when your character attempts something under pressure or uncertainty.
- **Proficiencies** are narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines that your character understands well and that shape how the GM interprets the fiction.

Open lists and collaboration allow the system to support many different genres and character concepts without requiring constant balance adjustments. Because the resolution system and advantage rules keep extremes in check, creative choices stay within a stable range.

The GM has final approval over the scope of any custom Skill or Proficiency. A good entry is grounded in the setting, clear in purpose, and neither so broad that it covers everything nor so narrow that it rarely matters.

### Step Four: Choose Skills

Skills represent learned abilities and practiced competencies. They describe what your character has done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. Skills connect directly to action. When your character makes a Check, a Skill often shapes their approach.

Skills answer the question, what have you practiced enough to apply under stress. They cover actions such as moving quietly, reading a room, patching an injury, climbing, or analyzing a pattern. Skills are usually written as verbs or verb like phrases.

> **Suggested Skills**
>
> A Skill should be broad enough to apply in multiple situations but specific enough to feel distinct.
>
> **Too broad:** "Good at everything physical."
> **Too narrow:** "Tying sailor knots."
> **Just right:** "Athletics" or "Acrobatics."
>
> | Category | Example Skills |
> |----------|----------------|
> | **Physical** | Athletics, Acrobatics, Climbing, Swimming, Endurance, Brawling |
> | **Social** | Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Empathy, Negotiation |
> | **Mental** | Investigation, Observation, Analysis, Research, Memory, Deduction |
> | **Technical** | Technical Work, Crafting, Machinery, First Aid, Lockpicking, Piloting |
> | **Stealth/Survival** | Stealth, Survival, Tracking, Navigation, Foraging |
>
> Choose 3-4 Skills that fit your concept. You may also create custom Skills with GM approval.

During Character Creation, choose a small set of Skills that reflect your concept and background. These are the actions your character knows how to perform with some confidence. Later chapters describe Skills in more detail and provide example lists grouped by Attribute.

> **Example**
> Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels.

You do not need to optimize your Skills. The best choices are the ones that support the kinds of scenes you want to experience. If your group plans to focus on investigation, travel, or social tension, choose Skills that will shine in those situations.

### Step Five: Choose Proficiencies

Proficiencies represent narrower areas of expertise that influence how the GM interprets the fiction. They describe tools, technologies, environments, or disciplines that your character understands deeply. Proficiencies often do not require a roll at all. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is obvious, or how serious a risk feels.

Proficiencies answer the question, what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly. They often appear as nouns or domain labels, such as medical tools, survey equipment, or small boat navigation.

> **Suggested Proficiencies**
>
> Proficiencies represent specialized knowledge or tool familiarity. They often allow automatic success or avoid Checks entirely for routine applications.
>
> | Category | Example Proficiencies |
> |----------|----------------------|
> | **Tools** | Precision Tools, Medical Instruments, Lockpicks, Climbing Gear, Navigation Equipment |
> | **Knowledge** | Local History, Legal Procedures, Arcane Lore, Engineering Principles, Natural Sciences |
> | **Social Contexts** | Court Etiquette, Criminal Underworld, Academic Circles, Military Protocol |
> | **Environments** | Urban Navigation, Wilderness Survival, Underground Exploration, Maritime Operations |
> | **Vehicles/Craft** | Small Watercraft, Ground Vehicles, Aircraft, Mounted Animals |
>
> Choose 2-3 Proficiencies that reflect your background. Work with your GM to define scope.

During Character Creation, choose a small number of Proficiencies that grow naturally out of your concept and background. Work with the GM to make sure each Proficiency has a clear scope and fits the setting.

> **Example**
> Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.

Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they influence difficulty, consequences, and access to information. A character with the correct Proficiency may identify a hazard more quickly, avoid an unnecessary roll, or reduce the severity of a complication.

### Step Six: Determine Starting Gear

Your character begins play with a small set of equipment that fits their background, reflects their concept, and supports the type of stories they are about to enter. Gear does not provide numerical bonuses. It provides narrative capability, fictional positioning, and a sense of grounded reality.

Starting gear should feel personal and practical. It represents what your character already knows how to use. It also helps the GM understand what kind of situations your character is prepared for.

#### Basic Gear Package

New characters begin with the following items:

- Clothing suited to their environment
- A backpack or satchel
- Basic travel supplies
- A personal item that holds meaning

These are the essentials that allow any character to operate in the world.

#### Concept Driven Gear

In addition to the basic gear, each character chooses up to three items that reflect their background or profession. These items help define who they were before the story begins. They also give the GM material to work with when shaping scenes.

Examples include:

- A well used toolkit
- A compact field journal
- A collection of reference notes
- A handmade navigation compass
- A signal mirror
- A small medical pouch
- A set of precision tools
- A reliable lantern
- A simple musical instrument
- A deck of analysis cards
- A set of rope and climbing spikes

These items should feel directly connected to your concept and identity.

> **Example**
> Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work.

#### Tools and Equipment as Fictional Authority

Gear provides fictional authority. If your character carries the right tools for a task, the GM may:

- Lower difficulty
- Remove uncertainty
- Change the stakes
- Provide clearer approaches

Gear does not guarantee success. It enables meaningful choices and supports your character's expertise.

If the character does not have suitable gear, the GM might increase difficulty or introduce complications. Gear matters most when the environment or situation is demanding.

#### Weapons and Dangerous Tools

If the campaign tone allows for weapons or hazardous tools, characters may begin with one simple item that fits their concept. This might be:

- A pocket knife
- A small baton
- A bow with a few arrows
- A sturdy multi tool
- A simple sidearm, if the genre supports it

Weapons should be grounded in the fiction of your setting. They are not meant to be superior mechanical objects. They are narrative tools that help shape how your character approaches risk.

If your world does not include weapons or includes them only sparingly, this section may be reduced or removed based on GM preference.

#### Custom Gear

The player and GM may collaborate to create custom gear that supports the concept. The item should be:

- Clear in purpose
- Grounded in the setting
- Useful in scenes
- Not mechanically overwhelming

Good custom gear is memorable and unique without dominating the story.

### Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships

Every character comes from somewhere. They have lived a life before the story begins. They have connections, memories, challenges, and unfinished business. Establishing background and relationships gives the character emotional depth and provides the GM with narrative tools that will enrich scenes, challenges, and future arcs.

Background should answer simple questions about where you grew up, what kind of work you used to do, which pressures shaped you, and who influenced your habits. You do not need a long timeline. Focus on the few details that explain your current self.

> **Example**
> Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. The steady routine and quiet tension of relay work shaped her temperament and made her comfortable with long stretches of focused attention.

In addition to background, define one or two meaningful relationships. These might be mentors, rivals, family members, coworkers, or friends. The relationship does not need to be fully detailed. It only needs to be important enough that it might matter later.

> **Example**
> Rella names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing. Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods. The disagreement left tension that has never been resolved.

You do not need to define every relationship up front. Leave space for new connections to emerge in play. When a new NPC feels important, you can add them to your relationship list.

### Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads

Goals and drives explain why your character keeps moving. They are the internal pressures that shape choices and responses. A goal is something concrete your character wants to achieve. A drive is a deeper motivation or fear that pushes them.

Personal threads are unresolved elements in your character's life. They might be unanswered questions, unfulfilled promises, or lingering tensions. These threads give the GM material to weave into future scenes.

> **Example**
> Rella has a goal to decode an anomalous pattern she once intercepted and a drive to avoid causing harm through her work. A personal thread involves the mysterious origin of the pattern and who might have sent it.

Try to define at least one short-term goal, one long-term goal, and one or two personal threads. You can always revise these as the story unfolds.

### Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit

Once you have completed the previous steps, review your character as a whole. Ask whether the concept, identity elements, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, goals, and threads feel like parts of the same person.

Talk with the GM and other players about how your character fits into the campaign. Look for natural connections, shared history, or complementary goals. Adjust details where needed so that the group feels like a cohesive cast.

### Chapter Summary

Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the campaign. By moving from concept to identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, and goals, you build a character who feels grounded and ready for play. Later chapters explain how these elements interact with the core mechanics during sessions.

## 8. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

This chapter describes the core resolution engine of the game. Whenever a character takes an action and the outcome is uncertain, consequential, and within their reach to influence, the table may call for a Check. Checks turn intent and approach into dice, and dice back into story beats. Understanding how to call for, perform, and interpret Checks is essential for both players and the GM.

### When to Roll (and When Not To)

You roll when the GM calls for a Check. The GM should only do this when three conditions are all true:

- **Uncertainty**: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal conditions does not roll.
- **Consequence**: Failure or partial success would introduce tension, cost, or change. If failure just means "try again until it works," do not roll.
- **Agency**: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Do not roll for things entirely outside the characters' control.

If all three are present, a Check is appropriate. If one or more are missing, the GM either says "yes" and narrates success, or "no" and explains why it is impossible or out of scope. Checks are tools for focusing on interesting uncertainty, not a gate in front of every action.

> **Example – When to Roll**
> *Trigger:* A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous.
> *Assessment:* The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character's choices matter. The GM calls for a Check.
> *Counter-example:* The same character crossing a sturdy bridge in calm weather does not roll. Success is assumed; the story moves forward.

### The Core Check Procedure

Every Check follows the same basic loop:

1. The player declares intent and approach.
1. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
1. If needed, the GM selects an Attribute and relevant Skill, sets a DC, and notes any Tags, Conditions, or Proficiencies that might grant Edge or Burden.
1. The player rolls **4d6**, applies modifiers, and compares the total to the DC.
1. The table interprets the outcome tier (critical success, full success, partial success, failure, critical failure) and updates the fiction accordingly.

### Declaring Intent and Approach

When you declare an action, you state two things:

- **Intent**: What you want to achieve in the fiction.
- **Approach**: How you are trying to achieve it.

Intent focuses the scene. Approach determines which Attribute, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and Conditions are relevant. The more concrete and grounded your description, the easier it is for the GM to set an appropriate DC and for the group to picture the moment.

> **Example – Intent and Approach**
> *Intent:* "I want to get the factory foreman to delay shipment of the crates."
> *Approach:* "I speak with her in private, emphasize the safety risks, and show her evidence of the faulty wiring we found."
> The GM recognizes this as a PRE-based approach with a relevant social Skill and possibly a Proficiency related to safety procedures or technical documentation.

### Setting DCs

The GM sets a **Difficulty Class (DC)** to represent how hard the task is under current circumstances. The system uses a standard ladder:

| DC | Difficulty | When to Use | Example |
|----|------------|-------------|---------|
| **12** | Easy | Favorable conditions, helpful positioning, minor obstacles | Climbing a rough stone wall with plenty of handholds |
| **14** | Routine | Standard conditions, typical challenges, no special advantage | Picking a standard lock with proper tools |
| **16** | Tough | Unfavorable conditions, skilled opposition, time pressure | Convincing a suspicious guard to let you pass |
| **18** | Hard | Hostile conditions, significant obstacles, high stakes | Disarming a complex trap while enemies approach |
| **20** | Heroic | Extreme conditions, exceptional challenges, pushing limits | Leaping between rooftops in a thunderstorm |
| **22** | Legendary | Near-impossible, setting-defining moments, the edge of what is possible | Talking down a raging dragon mid-attack |

Start by imagining what success would look like in the scene and how far it is from effortless. Use lower DCs when characters have strong fictional positioning, good information, and safe conditions. Use higher DCs when time is short, the environment is hostile, or the task is at the edge of what is possible in the setting.

> **Note**
> DCs should reflect fictional positioning, not abstract difficulty. The same task might be DC 14 in good conditions and DC 18 in poor conditions. Let the story guide the number.

### Edge, Burden, Tags, and Conditions

Rather than constantly adjusting the DC, the game often represents favorable or unfavorable circumstances through **Edge** and **Burden**.

> **Edge and Burden Quick Reference**
>
> | Modifier | Dice Change | Common Sources |
> |----------|-------------|----------------|
> | **+1 Edge** | Roll 5d6, keep best 4 | Good positioning, helpful Tag, ally assistance, right tools |
> | **+2 Edge** | Roll 6d6, keep best 4 | Exceptional setup, multiple advantages combined, perfect conditions |
> | **-1 Burden** | Roll 5d6, keep worst 4 | Unfavorable Tag, minor Condition, poor visibility, improvised tools |
> | **-2 Burden** | Roll 6d6, keep worst 4 | Severe Condition, multiple disadvantages, hostile environment |
>
> **Stacking:** Multiple sources combine into a single level, capped at ±2. If you have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (e.g., +2 Edge and -1 Burden = +1 Edge).

Edge and Burden usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies, or prior setup actions. They represent the table's shared sense that the character is favored or hindered in this moment. Multiple sources combine into a single level of Edge or Burden and are capped at ±2—several small edges do not create infinite Edge, and multiple problems do not push you below −2. If a character would have both Edge and Burden, reduce them against each other (for example, +2 and −1 becomes +1) until only one side remains, then apply the final level.

Tags and Conditions described in earlier chapters provide a shared vocabulary for these modifiers: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, or *Exposed* might impose Burden; *Solid Cover* or *Marked* might grant Edge in specific contexts or to specific parties.

### Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

When a Check is called for, follow this procedure:

1. Roll **4d6**, adjusting the number of dice kept if Edge or Burden applies.
1. Add the relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects.
1. Compare the total to the DC to find the **margin** (Roll − DC).

The margin determines the outcome tier:

- **Critical Success**: Margin ≥ +5.
- **Full Success**: Margin ≥ 0.
- **Partial Success**: Margin −1 to −2.
- **Failure**: Margin ≤ −3.
- **Critical Failure**: Margin ≤ −7 or all 1s.

### Interpreting Outcomes

Every outcome tier should change the situation. The GM and players work together to describe what the dice mean in the fiction.

- **Critical Success** – You achieve more than you aimed for. Extra benefits, stronger position, or accelerated progress.
- **Full Success** – You get what you wanted with no significant cost. The scene moves forward cleanly.
- **Partial Success** – You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect. Momentum continues, tension rises.
- **Failure** – You do not achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Threats advance, resources strain, or positions worsen.
- **Critical Failure** – Things go significantly wrong. Use sparingly for dramatic beats: broken tools, dangerous exposure, or major escalations.

> **Outcome Tiers Quick Reference**
>
> | Margin | Outcome Tier | Typical Result | Example |
> |--------|--------------|----------------|---------|
> | **+5 or more** | Critical Success | Exceed your goal with bonus benefits | Pick the lock silently AND notice the trap behind it |
> | **0 to +4** | Full Success | Achieve your intent cleanly | Pick the lock without issue |
> | **-1 to -2** | Partial Success | Succeed with cost or complication | Pick the lock but make noise or damage your picks |
> | **-3 to -6** | Failure | Do not succeed; situation worsens | Lock resists; guards become suspicious |
> | **-7 or worse** (or all 1s) | Critical Failure | Significant setback or escalation | Lock jams; alarm triggers; tool breaks |

> **Example – Cross-Genre Check**
> *Trigger:* In a cozy town, a character tries to calm a panicked neighbor during a storm. In a sci-fi station, a character tries to reassure a frightened technician during a systems failure.
> *Roll:* Both are PRE-based Checks against DC 14 (Routine) with an appropriate social Skill. The cozy scene might grant Edge if the characters have a strong existing relationship.
> *Consequence:* Full success calms the NPC and stabilizes the scene. Partial success calms them but attaches a new obligation or rumor. Failure escalates the panic, spreading fear or misinformation.

### Group Checks and Assistance

Many actions involve more than one character. Rather than rolling for everyone separately every time, the GM can use:

- **Assistance**: One character leads the action, another assists. If the assistance is credible in the fiction, the leader gains Edge or a small bonus.
- **Representative Checks**: One Check stands in for a coordinated group effort. The outcome tier describes how the whole group fares.
- **Split Risks**: Two or more characters each roll, and the GM focuses on the most interesting combination of results rather than tracking every detail.

Pick the method that best fits the moment. Use single rolls when you want quick resolution. Use individual rolls when it is important that different characters face different consequences.

### Checks and Clocks

Some obstacles are too big for a single Check. Instead, the GM creates a **Clock** with several segments. Successful Checks tick the Clock forward; failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks.

Use Clocks when:

- Characters are working toward a long-term goal, such as investigating a mystery or repairing a ship.
- A danger is mounting over time, such as a collapsing tunnel, spreading fire, or advancing enemy force.
- Two or more forces are racing toward different outcomes (opposing Clocks).

> **Example – Clock and Checks**
> *Trigger:* The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.
> *Clocks:* "Evacuation Complete" (6 segments) and "Flood Waters Rise" (4 segments).
> *Rolls:* Each scene, characters make MIG, AGI, PRE, or RSN Checks based on their chosen contributions—lifting sandbags, coordinating crowds, analyzing routes. Successes advance the evacuation clock; failures or partials tick the flood clock or create new complications.
> *Outcome:* Which clock fills first determines whether the district is saved, partially saved, or overwhelmed.

### Keeping Momentum

Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt:

- Use Partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action.
- Let Failures create new problems, reveal information, or shift the situation rather than blocking all paths.
- Allow retries only when the circumstances or approach meaningfully change.

The goal is not to punish characters for rolling poorly. The goal is to discover what happens next when risk meets intent. If the table keeps that in view, Checks will feel like natural beats in the story rather than interruptions.

### Chapter Summary

Checks are the core resolution tool: declare intent and approach, assess whether a roll is needed, set DC and modifiers, roll 4d6, and interpret the outcome. Edge and Burden adjust dice rather than targets. Outcome tiers—from Critical Success to Critical Failure—shape consequences. Use the quick-reference tables during play to keep the action flowing.

```markdown
## 9. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive. They connect description to mechanics so that rain, fear, injuries, crowds, and looming deadlines all matter at the table. This chapter explains what each of these tools is for, how to use them, and how they interact with Checks.

### Tags vs. Conditions

**Tags** describe **the environment or situation**. They belong to places, scenes, objects, or circumstances: *Dim Light*, *Slick*, *Crowded*, *Fragile Cover*. Tags affect what you can do in a space and how you do it.

**Conditions** describe **your character's state**. They follow you from one location to the next until cleared: *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*, *Frightened*, *Restrained*. Conditions affect your actions wherever you go.

Tags and Conditions are the shared vocabulary the table uses to talk about advantages, risks, and lingering consequences. They are not extra subsystems to memorize. They are the names you give to things you are already describing.

### What Tags Do

A Tag is a short descriptor applied to a scene, location, object, or situation. It becomes a flag: "remember this when resolving actions here." Tags typically:

- Grant Edge or Burden on certain Checks.
- Raise or lower DCs for specific actions.
- Change position or effect (how risky an action feels or how big its impact is).

You do not tag every detail. A room is just a room until its darkness, instability, crowd, or sacred significance matters to what characters are attempting. Tag the things that will shape decisions.

### Common Tags Quick Reference

> **Common Tags Quick Reference**
>
> Use this table during play to quickly identify how Tags affect actions.
>
> **Environmental Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Dim Light* | Burden on vision-based actions; Edge on Stealth | Dusk, candlelight, fog, shuttered windows |
> | *Darkness* | Severe Burden or impossible for sight-based tasks | Night without light sources, underground |
> | *Slick* | Burden on movement and balance Checks | Rain, ice, oil spills, wet stone |
> | *Cramped* | Burden on wide swings and large movements | Narrow passages, crowded rooms, tunnels |
> | *Elevated* | Edge on ranged attacks from above; risk of falling | Rooftops, balconies, cliff edges |
> | *Solid Cover* | Edge on defense; blocks line of sight | Stone walls, heavy furniture, vehicles |
> | *Fragile Cover* | Limited protection; can be destroyed | Wooden crates, thin walls, market stalls |
> | *Unstable* | Risk of collapse; Burden on careful actions | Old bridges, crumbling floors, scaffolding |
>
> **Situational Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Outnumbered* | Burden on defense; enemies may gang up | Multiple foes vs. fewer defenders |
> | *Flanked* | Burden on defense against flanking attacks | Enemies on opposite sides |
> | *Surprised* | Cannot act in first round; Burden on initial reactions | Ambush, failed awareness Check |
> | *Exposed* | Burden on defense; easy target | No cover, caught in open ground |
> | *Hazardous* | Risk of harm from environment; may tick threat Clocks | Fire, toxic fumes, electrical danger |
> | *Surveillance* | Actions may be observed and reported | Guards, cameras, informants nearby |
>
> **Atmospheric Tags**
>
> | Tag | Typical Effect | Common Sources |
> |-----|----------------|----------------|
> | *Tense* | Social missteps escalate quickly; Burden on calming actions | Standoffs, negotiations, high stakes |
> | *Chaotic* | Burden on coordination; opportunities for misdirection | Riots, battles, emergencies |
> | *Formal* | Burden on informal approaches; Edge for proper etiquette | Courts, ceremonies, official meetings |
> | *Suspicious* | Burden on trust-building; increased scrutiny | After crimes, with strangers, in enemy territory |

You can invent new Tags that fit your setting. The important part is agreeing at the table what a Tag does in practice: which actions it helps, which it hinders, and how it shapes consequences.

> **Example – Tags in a Warehouse Fight**
> The GM describes a warehouse full of stacked crates, narrow aisles, and oil-spotted floors. They assign the Tags *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, and *Slick*.
> *Cramped* makes wide swings and large weapons awkward. *Fragile Cover* means wooden crates can be shredded by fire, potentially stripping cover away. *Slick* imposes Burden on fast movement or acrobatic maneuvers. Every decision in this scene now has texture.

### What Conditions Do

Conditions represent persistent states that modify what a character can safely attempt. They are the mechanical mark left by consequences. When something important happens to you—injury, fear, strain, affliction—it often becomes a Condition.

Conditions typically:

- Impose Burden on certain actions.
- Limit available options (cannot run, cannot act this turn, cannot speak clearly).
- Threaten further harm if ignored (ongoing damage, ticking Clocks).

### Examples of Common Conditions

A full alphabetical list appears in the Glossary. Here are a few you will see often:

- **Exhausted** – Burden on demanding physical actions until you rest or receive meaningful aid.
- **Bleeding** – Time pressure from an untreated wound. If not stabilized, it may tick a personal Clock or escalate to worse states.
- **Restrained** – You are held or pinned. You cannot move freely and must break free or be helped.
- **Dazed** – Disoriented; Burden on perception and reaction until you recover.
- **Frightened** – Burden on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when you rally, escape, or defeat the source.

> **Example – From Event to Condition**
> A character fails a Check while crossing a compromised catwalk. Rather than simple damage, the GM describes how they slam into the railing and twist their knee. They gain the Condition *Exhausted* or *Weakened*, representing reduced stamina. Future physical actions are harder until they rest or receive treatment.

### Using Tags and Conditions with Checks

Tags and Conditions do not require new rules. They plug directly into the Check system:

- Tags often grant Edge or Burden on Checks that interact with them.
- Conditions usually impose Burden or limit which approaches are reasonable.
- Some Tags shift DCs or change position and effect instead of modifying dice directly.

When you are about to roll, quickly review which Tags and Conditions are relevant. Ask: "Does this make the action easier, harder, or riskier?" Then adjust Edge/Burden, DC, or consequences accordingly.

> **Example – Tag and Condition Interaction**
> In a horror-tinged mystery, a character stalks through a foggy graveyard at night. The scene has Tags *Dim Light* and *Obscured*. The character is also *Frightened* from a previous encounter.
> When they attempt to sneak past patrolling figures, *Dim Light* and *Obscured* might grant Edge on Stealth, but *Frightened* could impose Burden on actions taken while the threat is visible. The GM weighs these factors, cancels opposing modifiers as needed, and describes how the character's shaky nerves show up in the fiction.

### Introducing and Clearing Conditions

Conditions should follow naturally from events. A failed Check in a hazardous area might cause *Bleeding* or *Poisoned*. Exposure to overwhelming sights might cause *Frightened*. Pushing beyond safe limits might cause *Exhausted*.

When you introduce a Condition, state:

- What it represents in the fiction.
- How it affects actions (which Checks it modifies and how).
- How it can be cleared (time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock).

Minor Conditions should clear quickly once addressed. Major Conditions may persist across several scenes or form the basis for character-driven goals.

### What Clocks Are

Clocks are segmented trackers that answer "how close are we?" for goals and threats. A Clock is a circle or track divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments. As actions succeed, time passes, or events occur, segments fill. When the Clock completes, something happens.

Use Clocks to represent:

- **Long-term goals** – Research projects, faction plans, character endeavors.
- **Mounting threats** – Approaching storms, advancing enemies, spreading plagues.
- **Ticking dangers** – Rituals completing, bombs counting down, collapsing structures.
- **Faction projects** – Off-screen activities of NPCs and organizations.

### Clock Advancement Guide

Understanding when and how Clocks advance is crucial for pacing and tension. Use these guidelines:

> **Clock Advancement by Outcome**
>
> | Outcome Tier | Progress Clock Effect | Threat Clock Effect |
> |--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
> | **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments | No threat advance |
> | **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments | No threat advance |
> | **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment | May tick threat Clock 1 segment |
> | **Failure** | No progress | Tick threat Clock 1-2 segments |
> | **Critical Failure** | No progress | Tick threat Clock 2-3 segments |

#### Multi-Clock Guidance

When multiple Clocks are active, use this decision process:

1. **Identify the primary Clock.** Ask: "Which Clock does this action most directly affect?" Advance that Clock based on the outcome.

2. **Consider secondary effects.** If the action is loud, risky, or draws attention, ask: "Does this also affect a threat Clock?" If yes, tick it.

3. **Handle ambiguous actions.** When an action could affect multiple Clocks:
   - If the player's intent was clear, honor that intent
   - If uncertain, advance the Clock most connected to their stated approach
   - For truly split actions, consider ticking both at reduced rates

> **Decision Flowchart: Which Clock Advances?**
>
> ```
> Action Taken
>     │
>     ▼
> Does the action directly target a specific Clock?
>     │
>     ├─ YES → Advance that Clock based on outcome
>     │         │
>     │         ▼
>     │    Was the action loud, risky, or attention-drawing?
>     │         │
>     │         ├─ YES → Also tick the most relevant threat Clock
>     │         └─ NO  → Done
>     │
>     └─ NO → Which Clock is most affected by this approach?
>              │
>              ▼
>         Advance that Clock; consider threat Clocks if failure occurred
> ```

### Advancing Clocks

Clocks advance in several ways:

- **Success-based** – Successful Checks tick a project Clock forward.
- **Time-based** – Segments fill as scenes pass or as in-world time moves.
- **Event-based** – Specific narrative events advance background or faction Clocks.

Partial successes often advance a Clock and introduce a complication. Exceptional successes may jump a Clock by more than one segment. Failures might leave a Clock unchanged while pushing forward a related threat Clock.

### Opposing Clocks: A Worked Example

> **Example – Investigation vs. Cover-Up**
>
> The group is investigating a corrupt official while the official works to destroy evidence.
>
> **Clocks:**
> - "Expose the Official" – 6-segment Clock (investigation progress)
> - "Cover-Up Complete" – 4-segment Clock (enemy countermeasures)
>
> **Round 1:** The investigator searches the official's office.
> - *Check:* RSN-based Investigation against DC 16 (Tough—the office has been partially cleaned)
> - *Result:* Full Success (margin +2)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 2 segments. Found a ledger with suspicious entries.
> - *Threat Clock:* No advance—the search was quiet and unnoticed.
>
> **Round 2:** The investigator questions a nervous clerk.
> - *Check:* PRE-based Persuasion against DC 14 (Routine)
> - *Result:* Partial Success (margin -1)
> - *Effect:* Tick "Expose" 1 segment. Clerk reveals a name but is visibly frightened.
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 1 segment. The clerk will warn the official.
>
> **Round 3:** The official learns of the investigation and begins destroying documents.
> - *Event-based:* GM ticks "Cover-Up" 1 segment automatically (faction action).
> - "Cover-Up" now at 2/4 segments.
>
> **Round 4:** The investigator tries to intercept the document destruction.
> - *Check:* AGI-based Stealth against DC 16 (Tough—guards are alert)
> - *Result:* Failure (margin -4)
> - *Effect:* No progress on "Expose."
> - *Threat Clock:* Tick "Cover-Up" 2 segments. Guards catch the investigator; documents are burned.
> - "Cover-Up" fills to 4/4—evidence destroyed!
>
> **Outcome:** The Cover-Up Clock filled first. The official escapes immediate exposure, but the investigator has partial evidence (3/6 on "Expose"). The story continues with new stakes: can they find other witnesses before the official silences them?

### Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

These tools are most powerful when used together:

- Tags set the stage: terrain, lighting, crowds, magical effects.
- Conditions show how previous events cling to characters and shape their options.
- Clocks track momentum toward outcomes that matter over time.

A single scene might involve a *Hazardous* Tag, characters who are *Exhausted*, and a "Structural Collapse" Clock. Every roll becomes a meaningful choice about risk, effort, and timing.

> **GM Guidance – Start Small**
> You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene. Start with one or two Tags that matter, a few Conditions that arise naturally, and a single important Clock. Add more only when they clarify the fiction rather than clutter it. When in doubt, ask: "Does this tool make the situation clearer and more interesting?" If yes, use it.

### Chapter Summary

Tags describe environments and situations; Conditions describe character states; Clocks track progress toward outcomes. Use the Common Tags table for quick reference during play. Apply the Clock Advancement Guide to maintain consistent pacing. When multiple Clocks compete, let the fiction guide which advances. These tools work together to make the world feel responsive and stakes feel real.

## 10. Combat Basics

Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core combat actions to shape the fiction.

### Combat as a Scene

Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does not call for "initiative" the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know who acts in what order and how threats respond.

The table can always ask, "Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?" Use structured turns when:

- Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.
- Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.
- Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.

Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration. Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate "combat mode."

### Resolve Instead of Hit Points

The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close someone is to being taken out of a fight.

- **Resolve Clocks** track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC, or enemy can absorb before they are out of the scene.
- **Conditions** such as *Bleeding*, *Exhausted*, or *Stunned* mark lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.

When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your opponent's Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse, depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.

> **Why Resolve Clocks?**
>
> If you are coming from games with hit points, Resolve Clocks may feel unfamiliar. Here is why this system uses them:
>
> **Traditional HP:** A number that decreases. You ask "how many hit points left?" Combat becomes arithmetic—subtract damage, track totals, compare numbers.
>
> **Resolve Clocks:** Fictional pressure that increases. You ask "how close is this character to being taken out?" Combat becomes story—when do they falter, become desperate, finally break?
>
> | HP System | Resolve Clock System |
> |-----------|---------------------|
> | "The orc has 15 HP left" | "The orc's Clock is half full—he's getting desperate" |
> | "I deal 8 damage" | "Full Success on Strike—tick 2 segments" |
> | "He's at 0 HP, he dies" | "Clock fills—he flees, surrenders, or falls" |
> | Outcome is always depletion to zero | Outcome fits the stakes: defeat, capture, retreat |
> | Progress is hidden in numbers | Progress is visible: everyone sees the Clock filling |
>
> This keeps attention on narrative stakes rather than arithmetic, and lets different fights end in different ways.

#### Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?

Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:

- **Fiction first** – A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at "0 HP."
- **Visible progress** – A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.
- **Flexible stakes** – Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.
- **Pacing control** – The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick, cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.

Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and story rather than pure attrition.

> **Example – Enemy Resolve**
> A dangerous VPC has a 6-segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of the fight in a way that fits the story.

Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.

Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what "taken out" means in this scene. Are you trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises about consequences.

### Turns and Order

Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach that fits the scene.

> **Initiative Options Quick Reference**
>
> | Mode | How It Works | Best For |
> |------|--------------|----------|
> | **Conversational** | GM asks "Who acts next?" and rotates spotlight naturally | Small skirmishes, narrative focus, simple fights |
> | **Popcorn** | After resolving your turn, you choose who goes next (ally or enemy) | Dynamic fights, unpredictable flow, keeping everyone engaged |
> | **Rolled** | Each participant rolls AGI or relevant Check; act in order from highest to lowest | Tactical set-pieces, when precise timing matters, competitive scenarios |
>
> **GM Tip: Match Initiative to Scene Tone**
> - *Tense standoffs* → Conversational (builds suspense, allows negotiation)
> - *Chaotic melees* → Popcorn (captures confusion, surprises everyone)
> - *Tactical ambushes* → Rolled (rewards preparation, clear sequence)

Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands who is up next.

> **Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order**
> A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, "We're in structured turns now," and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.

### Your Turn: Structure and Options

On your turn, you usually:

- Describe what you do in the fiction.
- Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).
- Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.

If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters, it often fits into the same turn.

Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.

### Core Combat Actions

Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:

- **Strike** – Directly attack a target.
- **Maneuver** – Change position, create openings, or control space.
- **Set Up** – Create Edge or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.
- **Defend / Withdraw** – Protect yourself or break contact to recover.

#### Strike

Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot, hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on your opponent's awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.

On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become *Exposed*, suffer a counterblow, or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your opponent a positional or narrative advantage.

Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you commit to repeated Strikes.

#### Maneuver

Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside a weapon.

Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can create *Prone*, strip *Solid Cover*, or apply a useful Tag such as *Exposed* that allies can exploit on later turns.

Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a rope bridge. In sci-fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single Strike.

#### Set Up

Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you grant Edge or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the opening but at some cost.

Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Edge you create.

As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher-tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better positions, cover, and Edge, Strikes become dramatically more effective.

#### Defend / Withdraw

Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover, blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition or yielding ground.

This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or surviving to fight another day.

Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it, the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from "win here" to "escape, regroup, or change the stakes." Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.

### Positioning and Environment

Tags play a major role in combat. *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*, *Fragile Cover*, *Slick*, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or change what is possible at all. Manage position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.

> **Example – Using the Battlefield**
> In a rooftop fight marked as *Elevated* with scattered *Fragile Cover*, one character uses Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting Edge on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats *Elevated* as granting Edge on ranged attacks from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.

### Conditions in Combat

Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being *Stunned* by a concussive blast, *Bleeding* after a severe hit, or *Suppressed* by incoming fire. These Conditions modify subsequent Checks and shape choices.

Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be cleared. For example, *Stunned* might end after you lose your next action, while *Exhausted* may persist until you rest between scenes.

Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both *Bleeding* and *Exhausted* is under pressure each round and rolling with Burden on many actions. Scenes like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.

### Worked Combat Examples

These examples show complete combat sequences with Resolve Clock progression, demonstrating how the system flows in practice.

---

#### Example 1: The Tense Duel

**Setup:** Kira, a skilled duelist (AGI 2, Brawling Skill), faces Varro, a rival enforcer. Both have 4-segment Resolve Clocks. The scene is a rain-slicked courtyard (*Slick* Tag). Stakes: first to be taken out loses the dispute.

**Round 1 – Varro Strikes First**
- Varro lunges with his blade. AGI Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 17).
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 2 segments (now 2/4). She staggers back.
- *Fiction:* The blade catches her arm—a shallow cut but a solid hit.

**Round 2 – Kira Sets Up**
- Kira circles, watching his footwork, looking for a pattern. Set Up action.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 16 vs. DC 14).
- *Effect:* Kira gains Edge on her next Strike. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* She notices he overextends on his lunges—she can exploit that.

**Round 3 – Kira Strikes**
- Using her Edge, Kira feints low and strikes high. AGI Check with +1 Edge.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 21 with 5d6 keep 4).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/4). He reels.
- *Fiction:* Her blade opens a gash on his shoulder. Blood mixes with rain.

**Round 4 – Varro Maneuvers Desperately**
- Desperate, Varro kicks at the slick ground, spraying water toward her eyes.
- *Result:* Partial Success (rolled 13 vs. DC 14, margin -1).
- *Effect:* Kira gains *Dazed* (Burden next round), but Varro is now *Exposed*.
- *Fiction:* Water stings her eyes, but his wild kick leaves him off-balance.

**Round 5 – Kira Finishes It**
- Despite being *Dazed* (Burden), Kira presses. He's *Exposed* (Edge cancels Burden).
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 15).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock fills (4/4). He's taken out.
- *Fiction:* She drives him back against the fountain. His blade clatters away. He yields.

**Outcome:** Kira wins with 2/4 on her Clock. Varro is defeated but alive—he'll remember this.

---

#### Example 2: The Group Fight

**Setup:** Three PCs (Kira, Varn, Rella) face four bandits in a warehouse. Tags: *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, *Dim Light*. Bandits share a 6-segment group Resolve Clock. Each PC has a 4-segment Clock. Stakes: subdue or drive off the bandits.

**Round 1 – Bandits Attack**
- Two bandits rush Kira. GM rolls a group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Partial Success.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 1 segment (1/4). She takes a glancing blow.
- Two bandits circle toward Varn and Rella but don't reach them yet.

**Round 2 – Kira Maneuvers**
- Kira shoves crates to create better cover for allies. MIG Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Allies now have *Solid Cover* against ranged attacks. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* Heavy crates screech across the floor, forming a barricade.

**Round 3 – Varn Sets Up**
- Varn calls out bandit positions and weak points. PRE-based Set Up vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Kira and Rella both gain Edge on their next actions.
- *Fiction:* "The big one favors his left leg—go for it!"

**Round 4 – Rella Strikes (with Edge)**
- Rella throws her lantern at the bandits' feet. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 16.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 18 with 5d6).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 2 segments (2/6). The area gains *Hazardous* Tag.
- *Fiction:* Oil splashes and ignites. Two bandits scramble back, singed.

**Round 5 – Bandits Retaliate**
- Remaining bandits attack Rella (nearest threat). Group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Failure (rolled 11).
- *Effect:* No Clock advance on Rella. She ducks behind cover.
- *Fiction:* Clubs swing wide as Rella drops flat.

**Round 6 – Kira Strikes (with Edge from Round 3)**
- Kira charges the big bandit, targeting his weak leg. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 20).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 3 segments (5/6). The big one goes down.
- *Fiction:* Her blade sweeps his leg. He crashes into crates and doesn't get up.

**Round 7 – Varn Negotiates**
- With their leader down, Varn calls for surrender. PRE Check vs. DC 12 (lowered—they're losing).
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock fills (6/6). They surrender.
- *Fiction:* "It's over! Drop your weapons or burn with the warehouse!"

**Outcome:** Bandits subdued. Kira has 1/4 on her Clock. No one else was seriously hurt. The *Hazardous* fire must be dealt with, but the fight is won.

### Putting It Together

A typical combat turn might look like this:

1. The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.
1. You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.
1. The GM sets DC, notes any Edge/Burden, and clarifies stakes.
1. You roll **4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.
1. The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.

Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when Edge and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a series of disconnected attacks.

The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs, VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre-flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.

### Chapter Summary

Combat uses the same Check system as other scenes, focused through Resolve Clocks, core combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw), and environmental Tags. Choose an initiative mode that fits the scene tone. Use the Resolve Clock comparison to understand why this system tracks pressure rather than hit points. The worked examples show how Clocks, Tags, and actions combine into dynamic fights with meaningful stakes.

## Dice Notation Standards

### Basic Notation

| Format | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| NdX | Roll N dice with X sides | 4d6 = roll 4 six-sided dice |
| NdX+M | Roll NdX, add M to total | 2d6+3 = roll 2d6, add 3 |
| NdX-M | Roll NdX, subtract M from total | 1d8-1 = roll 1d8, subtract 1 |

### Edge and Burden Notation

| Modifier | Notation | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| +1 Edge | Roll 5d6, keep best 4 | Add one die, drop lowest |
| +2 Edge | Roll 6d6, keep best 4 | Add two dice, drop two lowest |
| -1 Burden | Roll 5d6, keep worst 4 | Add one die, drop highest |
| -2 Burden | Roll 6d6, keep worst 4 | Add two dice, drop two highest |

### Writing About Dice

When explaining dice mechanics in prose:

**Do:**
> "Roll **4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare the total to the DC."

> "With +1 Edge, roll 5d6 and keep the best 4 dice."

**Avoid:**
> "Roll four six-sided dice."

> "With advantage, roll an extra die and drop the lowest."

### Dice in Examples

In examples, show the full mechanical sequence:

> **Example - Calculating Margin**
> The DC is 16. You roll 4d6 and get 3, 4, 5, 6 for a total of 18.
> Your Attribute adds +2, bringing your result to 20.
> Margin = 20 - 16 = +4, which is a **Full Success**.

## Difficulty Class Standards

### Standard DC Ladder

Always use this ladder consistently:

| DC | Difficulty Level | When to Use |
|----|------------------|-------------|
| 12 | Easy | Favorable conditions, strong positioning |
| 14 | Routine | Standard conditions, typical challenges |
| 16 | Tough | Unfavorable conditions, skilled opposition |
| 18 | Hard | Hostile conditions, significant obstacles |
| 20 | Heroic | Extreme conditions, exceptional challenges |
| 22 | Legendary | Near-impossible, setting-defining moments |

### DC in Prose

Reference DCs naturally:

**Do:**
> "The GM sets a DC of 16 for the tough climb."
> "Against DC 14, this is a Routine task."

**Avoid:**
> "The GM sets difficulty at sixteen."
> "This is difficulty class 14."

### When to Specify DC

- Always specify DC when showing example Checks
- Specify DC ranges when discussing task categories
- Use descriptive terms (Easy, Routine, Tough) alongside numbers

## Rules Text Patterns

### Check Format

When describing a Check in rules text, use this pattern:

```
[Situation] → [Attribute]-based Check → [DC/difficulty] → [Outcome interpretation]
```

**Example:**
> When a character attempts to calm a frightened NPC, the GM calls for a PRE-based Check. Against DC 14, a **Full Success** calms the NPC completely. A **Partial Success** calms them but creates an obligation. **Failure** spreads the panic further.

### Outcome Format

Present outcome tiers in a consistent order:

1. **Critical Success** (margin +5 or more)
2. **Full Success** (margin 0 to +4)
3. **Partial Success** (margin -1 to -2)
4. **Failure** (margin -3 to -6)
5. **Critical Failure** (margin -7 or worse, or all 1s)

When space is limited, you may omit Critical tiers and focus on Full/Partial/Failure.

### Tag Application Pattern

When describing how Tags apply:

```
[Tag name] + [mechanical effect] + [fictional context]
```

**Example:**
> *Dim Light* imposes Burden on actions requiring clear sight but grants Edge on Stealth attempts. Characters can use light sources to remove this Tag from their immediate area.

### Condition Application Pattern

When describing how Conditions work:

```
[Condition name] + [source] + [effect] + [clearing method]
```

**Example:**
> **Exhausted** - Acquired through overexertion or sustained hardship. Imposes Burden on demanding physical actions. Clears after meaningful rest or appropriate aid.

## Clock Mechanics Documentation

### Clock Sizes

Use standard clock sizes:

| Segments | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| 4-segment | Quick threats, minor goals, time pressure |
| 6-segment | Standard projects, moderate obstacles |
| 8-segment | Major endeavors, significant threats |

### Clock Notation

Write clock references consistently:

**Do:**
- "Create a 6-segment 'Investigation' Clock."
- "The 'Flood Waters Rise' Clock has 4 segments."
- "Tick the Clock forward by 2 segments."

**Avoid:**
- "Create a six segment investigation clock."
- "The flood waters rise clock has four segments."
- "Advance the clock two segments."

### Clock Advancement

Document clock advancement clearly:

| Result | Clock Effect |
|--------|--------------|
| **Critical Success** | Tick 2-3 segments |
| **Full Success** | Tick 1-2 segments |
| **Partial Success** | Tick 1 segment, plus complication |
| **Failure** | No progress, may tick threat Clock |

### Opposing Clocks

When documenting racing clocks:

> **Example - Opposing Clocks**
> The group investigates a corrupt official while the official works to cover their tracks.
> - "Expose the Official" - 6-segment Clock (investigation progress)
> - "Cover-Up" - 4-segment Clock (enemy countermeasures)
>
> Successful investigation Checks advance the first Clock. Failures, loud approaches, or conspicuous actions advance the second. Which Clock fills first determines the outcome.

## Example Patterns

### Combat Example Pattern

```markdown
> **Example - [Combat Concept]**
> [Scene setup with relevant Tags]
> [Character action and intent]
> [Check details: Attribute, DC, modifiers]
> [Outcome and fictional result]
> [Clock or Condition changes if applicable]
```

**Full Example:**
> **Example - Strike Action**
> In a rooftop fight marked *Elevated* with *Fragile Cover*, Kira attempts to disarm her opponent with a quick strike to their weapon arm.
>
> The GM calls for an AGI-based Check against DC 16. Kira has +1 Edge from flanking established by an ally's Set Up.
>
> She rolls 5d6 (keeping best 4): 2, 3, 5, 5, 6. Keeping 3, 5, 5, 6 = 19. With AGI +1, her total is 20. Margin = +4, a **Full Success**.
>
> The opponent's weapon clatters across the rooftop. The GM ticks 2 segments on their Resolve Clock and applies the *Disarmed* Tag.

### Skill Check Example Pattern

```markdown
> **Example - [Skill Check Type]**
> *Trigger:* [What prompts the Check]
> *Assessment:* [Why a Check is appropriate]
> *Roll:* [Mechanical details]
> *Consequence:* [Outcome by tier]
```

**Full Example:**
> **Example - Social Influence**
> *Trigger:* A character wants to convince the factory foreman to delay shipment of suspicious crates.
>
> *Assessment:* The outcome is uncertain (the foreman has orders), consequential (the shipment contains evidence), and within the character's influence (they have documentation of safety violations).
>
> *Roll:* PRE-based Check against DC 14 (Routine social situation) with potential Edge from the documentation.
>
> *Consequence:* **Full Success** - the foreman agrees and becomes a potential ally. **Partial Success** - the foreman delays but demands a personal favor in return. **Failure** - the foreman refuses and reports the inquiry to management.

## Consistency Rules

### Define Before Use

Always define game terms before using them in complex explanations:

**Do:**
> **Edge** grants favorable dice. When you have Edge, roll additional dice and keep the best results. With +1 Edge, roll 5d6 and keep the best 4.

**Avoid:**
> Roll with Edge to improve your chances. Edge means rolling extra dice.

### DC Range Consistency

Always use the standard DC values. Do not invent intermediate values:

**Do:** DC 12, DC 14, DC 16, DC 18, DC 20, DC 22

**Avoid:** DC 13, DC 15, DC 17, DC 19

### Clock Size Consistency

Use standard clock sizes. Do not use non-standard segments:

**Do:** 4-segment, 6-segment, 8-segment

**Avoid:** 3-segment, 5-segment, 7-segment, 10-segment

### Attribute Reference Consistency

When referencing Attributes:

- First mention: **Might (MIG)**, **Agility (AGI)**, **Presence (PRE)**, **Reason (RSN)**
- Subsequent mentions: Use either full name or abbreviation consistently within a section
- In mechanical notation: Use abbreviations (MIG-based Check, PRE roll)

### Tag and Condition Consistency

- Always italicize Tag and Condition names
- Use Title Case: *Dim Light*, *Fragile Cover*, *Exhausted*
- Be consistent with Tag naming: *Elevated* not *High Ground* (unless both are defined)
