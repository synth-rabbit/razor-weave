   - Description: No quick-start or simplified character creation option for one-shots; Attribute spread of 2/1/1/0 produces mathematically flat characters; Skills and Proficiencies are designed for collaborative creation rather than selection from lists.

   - Affected personas: core-jordan-busy-parent, core-marcus-osr-veteran, core-casey-neurodivergent, core-taylor-video-game-convert, core-sam-forever-gm, gen-1763838681232-v4awudkf2

   - Affected personas: core-marcus-osr-veteran, core-casey-neurodivergent, core-taylor-video-game-convert, gen-1763838681215-4psxwhylv, gen-1763838681232-v4awudkf2, gen-1763838681275-hooveor8y
   - Description: DC setting relies on qualitative guidance rather than objective benchmarks; The outcome tier table (Critical Success, Full Success, etc.) is critical reference material but is only presented inline in explanatory text. No dedicated quick-reference format is provided in the chapter.; No comprehensive Edge/Burden reference table

5. **Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks** (Severity: 6, Frequency: 5/41)
   - Affected personas: core-jordan-busy-parent, core-casey-neurodivergent, gen-1763838681215-4psxwhylv, gen-1763838681275-hooveor8y, gen-1763838681286-aclnx3tbg
   - Description: Large number of potential tags to track without a consolidated quick-reference; Clock advancement guidance for threat clocks is vague. The book says 'failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks' but provides insufficient criteria for which clock to tick when multiple are active.; Clock advancement triggers lack numerical precision

6. **Chapter 5: Ways to Play the Game** (Severity: 5, Frequency: 5/41)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763838681218-x9vrpaife, gen-1763838681233-6co078kis, gen-1763838681257-jta0cf6fr, gen-1763838681286-aclnx3tbg, gen-1763838681283-e5ti6eeh2
   - Description: GMless and distributed authority modes underdeveloped; GMless play procedures lack sufficient detail for implementation; GMless cooperative mode lacks character-centric framing

8. **Chapter 8 - Actions, Checks, and Outcomes** (Severity: 3, Frequency: 3/41)
   - Affected personas: core-devon-solo-player, core-alex-indie-convert, core-riley-rules-lawyer
   - Description: Markdown formatting artifacts visible in text (asterisks around emphasis); The interaction between Proficiencies and Checks could be more explicitly defined - text says Proficiencies 'often do not require a roll' but the exact conditions remain somewhat ambiguous; The margin-based outcome system is excellent, but no explicit guidance on how Conditions translate to Burden levels. Some Conditions impose Burden, some 'limit options' - but which is which?

9. **Core Resolution** (Severity: 2, Frequency: 3/41)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763838681209-s6igub29b, gen-1763838681226-s3vgqnvw1, gen-1763838681275-np158u2rv
   - Description: Position/Effect framework lacks concrete decision aids for GMs new to fiction-first play; No probability breakdown for Dice Ladder outcomes; The basic roll mechanics are clear, but the relationship between threads and the weave pool takes too long to explain

10. **Chapter 3: Character Creation** (Severity: 1, Frequency: 3/41)
   - Affected personas: gen-1763838681243-dgyudgqq1, gen-1763838681264-r11lwhh96, gen-1763838681255-sloivu8ww
