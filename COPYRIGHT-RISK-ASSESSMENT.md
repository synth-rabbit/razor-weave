# Razorweave Copyright Risk Assessment

**Date:** November 19, 2025
**Reviewer:** AI Analysis (Not Legal Advice)
**Status:** PRELIMINARY - Consult with IP attorney for formal opinion

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This is NOT legal advice. This is a preliminary assessment based on general copyright principles. For actual legal protection, you MUST consult with an intellectual property attorney.

## Executive Summary

**Overall Risk Level: LOW-MODERATE**

The Razorweave rulebook appears to use common RPG mechanics and terminology that are generally considered part of the "game mechanics doctrine" (which are not copyrightable). However, some areas require attention.

---

## 1. Game Mechanics Analysis

### ✅ LOW RISK - Generic/Non-Copyrightable Elements

These elements are common across RPGs and generally NOT protected:
- **Dice rolling mechanics** (d6, d20, etc.)
- **Attribute systems** (stats like Strength, Agility, etc.)
- **Action resolution** (roll + modifier vs. target number)
- **Turn-based combat**
- **Character advancement/leveling**
- **GM/Player structure**
- **Scene-based gameplay**

**Why Low Risk:** Game rules and mechanics cannot be copyrighted (only the specific expression of them). Your implementation appears original.

### ✅ SAFE - Original Terminology

Your unique terms appear original:
- "Razorweave" (the game name)
- Custom world-building elements
- Original fiction and flavor text
- Specific rule implementations

---

## 2. Potential Copyright Concerns

### 🟡 MODERATE RISK - Common RPG Terminology

**Terms to Review:**
- **"GM" (Game Master)** - Generic, widely used
- **"Tag" system** - Common mechanic name
- **"Clock" mechanics** - Popularized by Blades in the Dark (but is a mechanic, not expression)
- **"Conditions"** - Generic term used across many games

**Recommendation:** These are likely fine as they're functional terms, but consider:
1. Adding unique branding ("Razorweave Clocks" vs. just "Clocks")
2. Explaining mechanics in your own words
3. Not copying exact wording from other games

### 🟡 MODERATE RISK - Stat Names

**Common Stats:**
- Strength, Agility, Intelligence, etc. - Used across many games

**Recommendation:** If your stat names are identical to a major RPG system (D&D, Pathfinder, etc.), consider renaming them or at least ensuring your descriptions are completely original.

### 🔴 HIGHER RISK - Direct References

**Check for:**
- [ ] Direct quotes from other games
- [ ] Exact mechanical formulas copied verbatim
- [ ] Identical table structures/values
- [ ] Character creation processes that mirror another game exactly

**If found:** Rewrite in your own words or remove.

## 3. Art & Graphics Assessment

### Images Used:
- **AI-generated artwork (ChatGPT/DALL-E)** - You own these (see attribution)
- **Heroicons UI elements** - MIT License (properly attributed)
- **Google Fonts** - Open Font License (properly attributed)

**Risk:** MINIMAL - All properly licensed

---

## 4. Specific Game System Comparison

### vs. Dungeons & Dragons (WotC)
- ✅ **OGL Content:** If using any D&D 5e SRD content, ensure you're complying with OGL 1.0a (or avoiding it entirely after the OGL controversy)
- ✅ **Product Identity:** Avoid D&D-specific terms: "Dungeon Master", "d20 System", specific spell names, specific monster names
- ✅ **Mechanics:** Game mechanics can't be copyrighted, but specific expressions can

### vs. Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA)
- ✅ **"Moves" system:** If using PbtA-style moves, ensure wording is original
- ✅ **2d6 mechanics:** Common, not copyrightable
- ✅ **Playbooks:** The concept is fine, but don't copy exact text

### vs. Forged in the Dark (BitD)
- 🟡 **Clocks:** The clock mechanic is common now; just use your own explanation
- 🟡 **Position/Effect:** If using similar concepts, use different terminology
- 🟡 **Stress/Trauma:** Common stress mechanics are fine with original implementation

### vs. FATE
- ✅ **Aspects:** If using similar concept, rename and implement differently
- ✅ **FATE points/dice:** Don't use FATE-specific terminology or exact mechanics

---

## 5. Recommendations for Maximum Protection

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Review All Terminology**
   - [ ] Search for exact matches to D&D/Pathfinder terms
   - [ ] Replace or rewrite any suspicious matches
   - [ ] Add unique Razorweave branding to common terms

2. **Originality Audit**
   - [ ] Every rule description should be in your own words
   - [ ] Create unique examples (not copied from other games)
   - [ ] Ensure all tables use original values/structure

3. **Documentation**
   - [x] LICENSE.md with CC-BY-SA-4.0 (DONE)
   - [x] Terms of Service (DONE)
   - [ ] Bibliography/Inspiration section (optional but good practice)

4. **Legal Consultation**
   - [ ] Consult IP attorney before commercial release
   - [ ] Consider trademark registration for "Razorweave"
   - [ ] Professional copyright clearance if concerned

---

## 8. Final Recommendations

### Priority Actions:

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
1. **Word-for-word comparison** with D&D SRD, Pathfinder, and any other games you referenced
2. **Remove/rewrite** any passages that are too similar
3. **Add unique voice** - make examples and flavor text distinctly "Razorweave"

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
4. **Trademark search** for "Razorweave" to ensure it's available
5. **Professional review** by IP attorney ($500-2000 typically)
6. **Create "Inspiration" page** acknowledging games that influenced you (without copying)

**LOW PRIORITY:**
7. Consider **trademark registration** if planning commercial release
8. Document your **design process** to prove independent creation
9. Keep **version history** showing iterative development

---

## 9. Comparison to Other Free RPGs

Your approach is similar to successful free RPGs:
- **Dungeon World** (PbtA derivative) - Uses generic mechanics, original expression
- **Maze Rats** - Minimalist, original tables and procedures
- **Cairn** - Uses mechanics from Into the Odd but with original expression

**Key lesson:** Mechanics can be similar; expression must be original.

---

## Conclusion

**You appear to be in good shape legally, with a few caveats:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Original game concept and world
- Proper licensing (CC-BY-SA-4.0)
- Strong terms of service
- Proper attribution of third-party content

⚠️ **Areas to Address:**
- Review all terminology for accidental copying
- Ensure all rule descriptions are in your own words
- Consider IP attorney consultation before commercial release

**Bottom Line:** Your risk is LOW for general RPG publication, but MODERATE if you're concerned about litigation from major publishers. The protections you've added (Terms, License, Disclaimers) significantly reduce your personal liability.
