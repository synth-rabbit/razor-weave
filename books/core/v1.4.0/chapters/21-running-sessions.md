## 21. Running Sessions

This chapter helps you turn rules and preparation into a session that feels alive at the table. It focuses
        on what you do moment to moment as a GM: framing scenes, asking questions, calling for Checks, using Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks, and managing pacing so each session feels complete. It assumes a mix of readers:
        brand‑new GMs running their first game and experienced facilitators who are new to Razorweave.

You can read this chapter straight through, or you can treat each section as a tool you revisit as needed.
        Early sections focus on mindset and table expectations. Later sections walk through concrete procedures for
        opening, running, and closing sessions across genres.

### GM Mindset for Razorweave

In Razorweave, the GM is not an adversary, a referee above the fiction, or a passive narrator. You are a **facilitator of consequences**. You present situations honestly, embody NPCs and factions, and use the
        rules to show how the world pushes back when characters act.

**Fiction first** means you start from what is true in the world, not from the rule you are
        eager to use. Before you ever reach for dice, ask what the environment is like, what NPCs want, and what the
        characters are actually doing. A dim, rain‑slick alley with jumpy guards and bad lighting already suggests
        certain DCs and Tags. The mechanics follow that picture, not the other way around.

**Consequences, not punishments** means that when a roll goes poorly, you are not "getting
        back" at the players. You are showing the natural outcome of risk in a living world. A failed Check might
        fill a Clock faster than expected, shift a Tag from *Curious* to *Suspicious*, or impose a
        Condition that makes future scenes tenser. Outcomes can be sharp and memorable without feeling arbitrary.

**Shared ownership** means that even though you keep the world coherent and interesting, you
        also share tone, safety, and direction with the table. Ask questions. Invite players to describe details and
        help name Tags. When someone has a strong idea about how a scene might look, fold it into the fiction rather
        than defending your notes.

**Procedural world simulation** is another valid approach. Some GMs prefer to establish clear
        world rules and let events unfold logically from those principles, even when it creates surprising outcomes.
        In this style, you track faction resources, weather patterns, or political cycles independently of player
        actions. NPCs pursue their goals whether or not the characters are watching. This approach works well with
        Razorweave's Clocks and fronts: run them as deterministic timers, and let consequences emerge from the
        intersection of character choices and world logic. The key is consistency—whatever your style, commit to it
        and communicate clearly so players understand how the world responds.

> **GM Guidance – The Three Questions**
When you feel stuck in a scene, return to three questions: "What do the NPCs want? What do the players care
>         about here? What would happen if no one acted?" The answers almost always suggest the next move, a new Tag,
>         or a Clock to start.

### Session Types and Structure

Not every session feels the same. Some are about urgent danger, others about quiet reflection or long‑term
        projects. Recognizing the type of session you are running makes it easier to choose which tools to emphasize.

**Launch sessions**are the first meetings of a campaign or arc. They establish tone, introduce
        safety tools, and give everyone an early success or discovery. You spend more time asking big questions,
        showing off a few striking locations, and letting players show who their characters are.

**Middle sessions**are the bulk of play. Fronts advance, Clocks tick, relationships deepen, and
        plans collide with opposition. You focus on presenting problems, showing consequences, and weaving together
        the threads characters care about.

**Climactic sessions**resolve long‑running Clocks and fronts. Stakes and consequences are at
        their highest. These sessions often feature multiple linked action or social scenes where previous
        decisions come due and Tags change rapidly.

**Downtime or bridge sessions**are quieter. Characters recover, pursue projects, and reorient
        between major arcs. You still use Clocks and Tags, but they track healing, research, relationships, and
        preparation rather than immediate danger.

You can blend these elements in a single session, but it helps to choose a primary focus. A launch session
        that suddenly becomes an arc finale may feel rushed; a climactic session that spends most of its time on
        shopping might feel deflated. Use Chapter 19 for deeper guidance on advancement pacing across these types.

### Before the Session: Prep and Alignment

Good sessions begin before everyone sits down. You do not need pages of notes. You do need clarity on what
        you are excited to see, what is already in motion, and what players care about.

Start by briefly**reviewing last time**. Skim your notes, Clocks, and Tags from the previous
        session. Notice which fronts are ready to move, which NPCs were left in tense positions, and which personal
        threads players highlighted. You are looking for momentum: unresolved questions, looming dangers, or
        opportunities that feel too good to ignore.

Then**choose a small number of anchors**. Pick two or three elements you want to feature: a
        location, an NPC, a looming Clock, a relationship question. These anchors become the backbone of your scene
        framing. If everything goes sideways, you can still pivot back to one of them.

Finally, whenever you can,**check expectations**with your players. A quick message like “Next
        session I’m planning to focus on the harbor crackdown and your meeting with the magistrate—anything else you
        really want to hit?” gives you a chance to align your anchors with their interests before everyone sits down.

> **Example – Lightweight Prep**
Before the session, you skim notes and see an 8‑segment *Smuggling Crackdown* Clock at 5 of 8 and a
>         Tag on the harbor, *Rumors of Sabotage*. You choose three anchors: the harbor at night, a customs
>         officer with doubts, and the Clock reaching 6 or 7 segments if the crew hesitates. That is enough to start.

### Session Agenda and Rhythm

A good session has a clear starting frame, several meaningful situations, and a sense of closure even if the
        story continues. You do not need a script. You need a strong opening, a handful of charged situations, and a
        way to end on purpose.

- **Strong Opening:**Remind the table where you left off. Reintroduce any active Clocks, key
          Tags, or Conditions. Ask one or two questions that spotlight the characters (“Who has not slept well since
          last time?”).
- **Middle Situations:**Present locations, NPCs, and problems that invite decisions. Use Tags,
          Clocks, and Checks from earlier chapters to keep pressure moving.
- **Closing Beat:**End on a new question, a consequence, or a moment of reflection. Note which
          Clocks advanced and which Tags or Conditions will matter next time.

You can write this agenda as a short list on your GM sheet or a visible note. Players do not need to see
        every detail, but sharing a loose structure (“We’ll start in the archive, then see where your investigation
        leads”) helps them plan.

> **GM Guidance – Keep the Agenda Visible**
You can share your session agenda with the table in simple terms: "We'll open at the harbor, deal with the
>         customs inspection, and then see how far you get toward the embassy." This helps players make choices and
>         gives everyone a shared sense of progress.

### Safety and Table Comfort Each Session

Safety and calibration tools from Chapter 20 are not just for campaign setup. Use them inside sessions to
        adjust tone and subject matter.

A simple**quick check‑in**at the start of a session—“Anything off‑limits tonight?” or “Is
        there anything you especially want to lean into?”—gives players a chance to name boundaries and desires in
        the moment. You can adjust which fronts you emphasize or how graphically you describe events based on their
        answers.

During intense scenes, be ready to**pause in the moment**. If a description or topic lands
        harder than expected, stop, check in, and adjust. You can summarize events or fade to black while still
        applying mechanical consequences such as Conditions or Clock advances. The fiction continues to move, but in
        a form that feels safer.

After a heavy scene, consider giving the table a short**aftercare moment**. Take a break, or
        follow up with lighter material, small talk between characters, or a brief montage. Let players shift out of
        character and confirm they feel ready to continue or wrap for the night.

> **Example – Adjusting a Scene**
In a horror‑tinged investigation, a description of a flooded cellar starts to feel too intense for one
>         player. You pause, check in, and agree to keep future descriptions less graphic. The cellar still carries the *Hazardous* and *Obscured* Tags, and Checks remain risky, but you describe the danger in more
>         abstract terms.

### Framing and Reframing Scenes

A scene begins when you choose where the camera is and what is immediately at stake. A strong frame tells
        players where they are, who is present, what matters right now, and what might happen if nothing changes.
        You then invite the players to respond in character.

When framing a scene, lean on Tags and Clocks:

**Location Tags**signal environment and position: a “Dimly Lit Warehouse” suggests different
        risks and opportunities than a “Crowded Market” or a bridge that is literally tagged “On Thin Ice.” When you
        name these Tags, you tell players what kinds of actions are natural and what might go wrong.

**NPC Tags**show attitude and leverage. A contact tagged “Tense” and “Overconfident” will react
        very differently from one tagged “Desperate for Approval.” These Tags help you improvise reactions while
        keeping the character consistent, and they give players something concrete to push against or support.

**Clocks**track rising danger, limited time, or evolving opportunities: “Guards Converge,”
        “Storm Front Approaches,” “Negotiations Sour.” When you advance a Clock as part of a new frame, you show how
        the world moves even when the characters are not looking directly at a threat.

Reframe a scene whenever the situation has clearly changed. Advance or clear Tags and Clocks, move the
        location, or jump forward in time. Ask players what their next focus is, then frame directly into that
        moment instead of playing out every step along the way.

> **Example – Reframing Around a Clock**
The crew is sneaking through a surveillance district with a *Security Sweep* Clock at 3 of 6. After
>         several tense Checks, the GM advances the Clock to 4 of 6 and reframes: "Later that night, as you pack up
>         your gear, spotlights sweep across your hideout. The *Security Sweep* Clock is nearly full. What do
>         you do?"

### Calling for Checks in Sessions

Chapters 8 and 10 explain how Checks work mechanically. At the table, your job is to decide when a Check is
        needed and how to reflect the fiction in DCs, Tags, Conditions, and outcome tiers.

Begin by**asking first, then rolling**. Always ask players what they do and how before you
        reach for dice. If the outcome is not uncertain or not meaningful, no Check is needed. Conversation and
        description are often enough when characters act within their established capabilities and the stakes are
        low.

When a Check is appropriate,**set DCs with context**. Use the DC ladder from Chapter 8, but
        let the fiction shape where you land on that ladder. A task might be Routine in calm conditions but Hard in
        a burning building. Say out loud what makes it easier or harder; this keeps DCs from feeling arbitrary.

As you choose DCs, **use Tags and Conditions** as levers. Apply Edge, Burden, or DC
        shifts when Tags and Conditions clearly help or hinder the attempt. A character with the *Focused* Condition tackling a research problem in a *Well-Stocked Archive* should feel the difference compared
        to a distracted argument in a noisy tavern.

Finally, **show outcomes in the fiction**. When you know the outcome tier, describe what it
        looks like in the scene, not just the numbers on the dice. Success should change the situation in ways
        everyone can feel; Failure and Partial Success should leave marks on Tags, Conditions, or Clocks.

> **Example – Check with Tags and Outcome Tiers**
The group tries to cross a slick rooftop in high wind. The location has *Slick* and *Elevated* Tags. The GM calls for a 4d6 Check using AGI and an appropriate Skill, DC 16 (Tough), with Burden from *Slick*. A Partial Success means someone slides toward the edge and starts a *Falling* Clock.
>         A Failure fills several segments at once.

### Using Tags, Conditions, and Clocks During Play

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are not just record‑keeping tools. They are how you signal what matters right
        now and what might change next. During a session:

When the fiction shifts, **announce new Tags**. Say it out loud and write it down: "The alley
        is now *Crowded* and *Tense*." This tells players what they should picture and what will
        matter mechanically in the next few moments.

As Clocks move, **point at their progress**. When you advance a Clock, briefly describe what
        that looks like: more guards on the street, sirens in the distance, rumors spreading through the market. Let
        players see and feel the change instead of only hearing "the Clock ticks up."

When a character gains a Condition, **treat it as a promise** about how future scenes will
        unfold. "Shaken" means fear may resurface at a bad moment. "Backed by Authority" means doors open more
        easily—until that authority falters. Conditions are story hooks as much as mechanical modifiers.

> **GM Guidance – Speak Your Mechanics**
When you create or change a Tag, Condition, or Clock, pair the mechanical note with a short narrative
>         description. This keeps players immersed and makes the system feel like part of the story, not a separate
>         layer.

### Pacing, Spotlight, and Breaks

Pacing is about how quickly the situation changes and how often each character gets a meaningful chance to
        act. You can adjust pacing by how you cut between characters, how much you summarize, and how often you
        escalate Clocks or introduce new Tags.

One of your simplest tools is to **rotate the spotlight**. After one character's action
        resolves, check in with someone else—"What are you doing while this happens?"—and let them move the story
        forward. In complex scenes, especially with split groups, this rotation keeps everyone engaged and reminds
        you to track multiple fronts at once.

You can also **summarize transitions** instead of playing out each moment in real time. Skip
        unimportant travel, shopping, or small talk. Jump to the next moment where something is at stake: the
        confrontation, the discovery, the evening's quiet conversation that might change a relationship.

Finally, **use breaks intentionally**. Short pauses let players process intense scenes and give
        you a moment to review Clocks and Tags. Consider pausing after major outcome tiers or before big choices so
        everyone can think about what they want to do next.

> **GM Guidance – When in Doubt, Slow Down**
If a moment feels emotionally important or tactically complex, slow the pace. Ask players what their
>         characters are thinking. Clarify stakes and Tags. A deliberate pause often makes the next decision feel more
>         meaningful.

### Running Different Kinds of Scenes

Different scenes highlight different parts of the system. The following guidance helps you lean into the
        strengths of each type without losing the core 4d6 structure.

#### Investigation and Mystery Scenes

Investigations work best when information flows freely and Checks are about risk, not whether players can
        “find the plot.” Give clues generously. Use Checks to determine how quickly they find them, what extra
        context they gain, and what complications arise.

Set DCs lower when characters are simply uncovering basic facts. The challenge comes from what they do with
        the information, not whether they can spot a file on a shelf. Raise DCs when they push for leverage—trying
        to get a confession without causing alarm, for example—or when they are racing a rival or the clock. Use
        Clocks to track rival investigators, evidence disappearing, or rising suspicion, and Tags like *Under Watch*, *Loose Files*, or *Community Mistrust* to shape how each scene feels.

#### Social and Negotiation Scenes

Social scenes rely on clear goals, visible stakes, and strong NPC desires. Decide what each side wants and
        what they are unwilling to give up. Use Checks to resolve key turning points, not every line of dialogue.

Make the NPC's Tags and Conditions visible in play: "He seems *Nervous* but clearly *Backed by Authority*." Use Clocks to track trust, patience, or public opinion, and let Partial
        Successes shift Tags instead of ending negotiations outright—"Distrustful" becomes "Wary but Listening,"
        which invites a second attempt rather than closing the door.

#### Action and Combat Scenes

Chapter 10 provides the core combat structure. In this chapter, focus on how action scenes fit into the
        rhythm of a session. Treat each action scene as a short story: establish position and intent, escalate
        danger, and show clear consequences.

Use environmental Tags generously—cover, hazards, high ground—and invite players to interact with them. Track
        enemy goals with Clocks rather than focusing only on harm: "Hostages Moved," "Reactor Overheats," "Reinforcements
        Arrive." When harm does land, lean on Conditions for injury and morale; a single *Wounded* Condition
        can matter more than a series of tiny numerical reductions.

> **Example – Multi-Phase Action Scene**
In a sci-fi setting, the characters try to escape a failing orbital lab. You set a *Structural Collapse* Clock at 0 of 8 and Tag the environment as *Unstable* and *Low Gravity*. Early Checks are about
>         navigation and securing equipment. As the Clock advances, new Tags appear (*Smoke*, *Sparks*),
>         and later Checks involve dodging debris and getting the airlock open before the Clock fills.

#### Quiet, Reflective, and Downtime Scenes

Not every moment needs high tension. Downtime scenes let characters recover, pursue projects, and explore
        relationships. They support advancement triggers from Chapter 19 and deepen the emotional stakes of later
        conflicts.

Ask open questions about feelings, goals, and doubts, then let players narrate short montages of how their
        characters spend time. Use Clocks and Tags to track long‑term projects and emotional threads rather than
        immediate danger—research, training, community work, repairing trust. Call for Checks only when a project
        faces meaningful risk or uncertainty, not for routine tasks that would reasonably succeed.

### Ending Sessions Cleanly

End sessions on purpose. A clean ending helps everyone remember where you left off and gives you material
        for advancement and fronts.

Before you close your notebook, **review open Clocks**. Note which ones advanced, which are
        close to completion, and which new Clocks appeared. Think about what each Clock means in the fiction, and
        write a short phrase next to it if that helps ("security on edge," "union gaining support").

Then **recap Tags and Conditions**. List any persistent Tags or Conditions that will carry
        forward into the next session—changes to locations, factions, or characters that the group should remember.
        Saying them out loud anchors them in everyone's mind.

Finally, **invite reflection**. Ask each player for a highlight, a surprise, or a new question
        about the world. Use their answers to apply advancement triggers from Chapter 19 and to shape fronts and
        factions for future sessions. You can also adjust difficulty dials from Chapter 20 if the group wants more
        pressure, more room to breathe, or a shift in tone.

> **Example – End of Session Recap**
After dismantling a smuggling ring, the group reviews their notes. The *Smuggling Crackdown* Clock is
>         full, and the harbor's Tags shift from *Lawless* to *Tense but Watched*. One character takes an
>         advancement in a relevant Skill, another gains the Edge Condition *Respected by Dockworkers*. The GM
>         notes a new front: *Corporate Retaliation*, seeded by the group's success.

### Cross-Session Continuity

Tags and Clocks are living elements that evolve across sessions, not static notes locked to a single moment.
        Managing continuity between sessions keeps your world coherent and rewards players for remembering
        details—without requiring you to track every minor element forever.

#### What to Keep, What to Let Go

After each session, sort your Tags and Clocks into three categories:

**Active** elements are directly relevant to current fronts, character goals, or immediate situations.
        These persist until resolved or superseded. Examples: a *Security Sweep* Clock still ticking at 5 of 8,
        an NPC's *Suspicious* Tag following a tense conversation, a location tagged *Crime Scene* while
        an investigation continues. Keep these visible and ready to reference.

**Dormant** elements matter to the world but are not immediately pressing. They may resurface when
        characters return to a location or when a front shifts focus. Examples: an old ally's *Grateful* Condition from two sessions ago, a neighborhood tagged *Distrustful of Outsiders*, a partially filled *Rival Investigation* Clock that stalled when the characters changed priorities. Archive these in your
        notes with a short context phrase. You do not need to remember every detail, just enough to revive them when
        relevant.

**Resolved or expired** elements have served their purpose and no longer influence the fiction. Let
        them go. Examples: a completed Clock, a Tag that was only relevant to a single chase scene, a temporary
        Condition like *Distracted* that has naturally faded. Clearing these keeps your notes manageable and
        makes room for new developments.

#### Simple Tracking Methods

You do not need elaborate software. A simple tracking method lets you review continuity at a glance:

**GM session sheet** with three columns: "Active Now," "Watch This," and "Recently Resolved." At the
        end of each session, sort your Tags and Clocks into these columns. At the start of the next session, review
        "Active Now" to remind yourself what is in motion, and glance at "Watch This" to see what might resurface.

**Index cards or sticky notes** work well for physical play. Write each significant Tag or Clock on
        its own card. Active elements stay in front of you; dormant ones go into a small box organized by location,
        NPC, or front. When a location or NPC returns to play, pull the relevant cards and decide whether those
        elements are still true.

**Campaign document with dated entries** captures major shifts. After each session, add a short
        paragraph noting which Clocks advanced, which Tags changed, and any new fronts that emerged. This creates a
        timeline you can skim when you need to remember how a situation developed over multiple sessions.

#### Carrying Forward Between Sessions

Not every Tag or Clock needs explicit narration at the start of the next session, but players should feel
        continuity in the fiction. When you frame your opening scene, reference one or two persistent elements that
        connect to last time:

"The harbor still feels tense after the crackdown—patrols are more frequent, and dock workers keep their heads
        down" reminds everyone that the *Tense but Watched* Tag is active without rereading notes.

"The magistrate's *Impatient* Condition means he is less willing to hear excuses this time" signals
        that a past interaction has consequences now.

For Clocks, mention their status when relevant: "The *Storm Front Approaches* Clock is at 6 of 8—you
        can see dark clouds massing on the horizon, and the wind is already picking up." This shows how time has
        passed and gives players a clear sense of urgency.

#### When Continuity Breaks

Sometimes you forget an important Tag or Clock, or you realize mid-session that you have been treating a resolved
        element as still active. When this happens, acknowledge it clearly and decide as a table how to proceed.

If forgetting the element created a better story, let it go: "I said the bridge was clear, but I forgot we tagged
        it *Patrolled* last session. Let's say patrols shifted priorities after the riot—so the bridge is clear,
        and that Tag no longer applies."

If the forgotten element should have mattered, retcon gracefully: "Actually, I missed that the *Rival Investigation* Clock was at 7 of 8. Let me reframe: as you approach the archive, you notice someone
        else already inside—the rival investigator got here first. What do you do?"

Players are generally forgiving when you handle mistakes transparently. What matters is that the world feels
        consistent over time, not that you remember every minor detail perfectly.

> **GM Guidance – Review Before You Prep**
Before prepping each session, spend five minutes reviewing your previous session's Tags and Clocks. Ask
>         yourself: "What changed? What is still moving? What can I safely let fade?" This brief review keeps your world
>         consistent without requiring extensive note-taking during play.
