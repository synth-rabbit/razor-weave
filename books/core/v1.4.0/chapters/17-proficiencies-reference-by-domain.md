## 17. Proficiencies Reference

This chapter presents example Proficiencies grouped by domain. Like the Skills Reference, it is not an
        exhaustive catalog. Instead, it shows the kinds of expertise that matter in play—operations, lore,
        medicine, security, and community—along with sample uses and a selection of detailed entries you can adopt
        or adapt for your own campaigns.

Each table gives you four Proficiencies in a given area, with a brief explanation of what they represent
        and how they might appear in scenes. After the tables, several Proficiencies are expanded into full
        entries that follow the structure described in Chapter 16: description, scope and examples, default
        benefits, opportunities and risks, GM usage notes, and a worked example.

### Operations & Logistics Proficiencies

Operations and logistics Proficiencies cover the quiet work that keeps worlds moving: scheduling,
        routing, maintenance, and supply. Characters with these Proficiencies often control how fast things
        happen and how messy they become when pressure mounts.

Operations & Logistics Proficiencies****************

| Proficiency             | What It Represents                                                            | Sample Uses                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Harbor Operations       | Managing docks, berths, cargo flow, and vessel traffic in ports.              | Re‑routing ships to avoid congestion; spotting irregular manifests; fast‑tracking a vessel through customs without raising suspicion.     |
| Caravan Logistics       | Planning multi‑day routes, supplies, and contingencies for overland journeys. | Choosing safe camp sites; balancing loadouts against terrain; arranging escorts and guides across changing jurisdictions.                 |
| Station Traffic Control | Coordinating arrivals, departures, and emergency responses in busy hubs.      | Sequencing landings to prevent collision; opening priority lanes for emergency craft; identifying patterns that suggest sabotage.         |
| Supply Management       | Tracking inventory, requisitions, and shortages across multiple sites.        | Preventing stockouts before a storm; hiding the movement of sensitive equipment; noticing a pattern of “missing” goods tied to a faction. |

#### Harbor Operations — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Harbor Operations represents deep familiarity with how ports function: who
        talks to whom, which documents matter, how tides and schedules intertwine, and where traffic jams and
        accidents are most likely. A proficient harbor operator reads crowded docks the way others read street
        signs.

**Scope and examples:**Scheduling berths, issuing or interpreting docking clearances,
        arranging tugs and pilots, and coordinating with customs or security. In play, this Proficiency covers
        things like re‑assigning incoming ships, managing evacuation routes, or spotting dangerous loading
        practices before they cause harm.

**Default benefits:**Routine harbor tasks—assigning a berth, arranging a standard off‑load,
        reading signal flags—rarely require a Check. When pressure mounts, Harbor Operations often lowers DCs for
        Logistics or Systems & Diagnostics Checks, or grants Edge when re‑routing traffic under tight
        deadlines (for example, a Hard DC 18 task might become a Routine DC 14 with Edge).

**Opportunities and risks:**Harbor Operations puts you near the heart of trade and travel.
        The GM can use this Proficiency to surface rumors, political pressure, smuggling attempts, and accidents.
        It also makes you visible: powerful factions may notice when you intervene too often or bend the rules.

**GM usage notes:**Use this Proficiency to speed up scenes that would otherwise bog down in
        procedure. Let a proficient character “just know” what forms to file or which officials to call, reserving
        rolls for moments when disasters loom or when they push against policy.

> **Example**
> **Example – Harbor Operations**
A storm front closes in on a coastal city while the docks are packed. The GM frames a 6‑segment “Clear the
>         Harbor” Clock. A PC with Harbor Operations and Systems & Diagnostics takes charge. Instead of rolling
>         at DC 18, their Proficiency reduces the task to DC 14 and grants Edge on a PRE + Systems &
>         Diagnostics Check as they issue orders and adjust schedules. On a Full Success, two segments of the Clock
>         fill and ships pull away cleanly. On a Partial, the Clock advances but one overloaded vessel is forced to
>         remain, creating a new problem when the storm hits.

#### Caravan Logistics — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Caravan Logistics covers the art of moving people and goods over long
        distances by road, rail, or trail. It combines route planning, supply forecasting, and an understanding of
        weather, terrain, and border requirements.

**Scope and examples:**Choosing routes, calculating rations, planning rest stops, and
        budgeting for tolls or bribes. In play, this Proficiency influences decisions about when to push on, when
        to detour, and how to respond when the unexpected happens—washed‑out bridges, closed passes, or rumors of
        bandits.

**Default benefits:**Routine travel planning inside known territory is automatic; the GM
        simply describes a competent plan. When journeys become risky, Caravan Logistics can lower DCs on MIG + Grit
        & Endurance or RSN + Wayfinding Checks, or allow the group to attempt maneuvers others could not, such
        as rerouting an overloaded caravan through marginal paths.

**Opportunities and risks:**Caravans are social spaces filled with traders, guards, and
        travelers. This Proficiency gives the GM reasons to introduce side contracts, tensions over resources, or
        conflicting route advice, all of which you are well placed to mediate—or exploit.

**GM usage notes:**When a character with Caravan Logistics is present, front‑load their
        questions and recommendations. On Partial Successes, let the journey continue but with new Tags—*Low on
        Water*,*Fraying Tempers*, or*Suppressed Mutiny*—instead of simple delays.

> **Example**
> **Example – Caravan Logistics**
The group must move refugees across an arid plateau. The GM sets a “Reach the Oasis” Clock and notes Tags
>         like*Scorching Heat*and*Limited Wells*. With Caravan Logistics, a PC makes an RSN +
>         Wayfinding Check at DC 15 instead of DC 18. A Full Success advances the Clock and avoids additional
>         Conditions. A Partial advances the Clock but adds*Exhausted*to several refugees, seeding future
>         medical and moral decisions.

#### Station Traffic Control — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Station Traffic Control reflects training in managing crowded transit nodes:
        relay stations, orbital docks, subway interchanges, or similar hubs. You understand signal systems, safety
        protocols, and how small delays propagate into larger crises.

**Scope and examples:**Coordinating arrivals and departures, rerouting vehicles during
        emergencies, prioritizing medical or security craft, and reading traffic patterns for signs of unusual
        activity. In play, this Proficiency often appears in tense sequences where timing matters.

**Default benefits:**Routine scheduling rarely calls for a roll. Under pressure, Station
        Traffic Control can provide Edge on PRE or RSN Checks involving large‑scale movement, and may allow
        the group to treat some Failures as Partial Successes when responding quickly averts the worst outcomes.

**Opportunities and risks:**Traffic controllers are plugged into both official channels and
        back‑channel chatter. Their position makes it easy to notice suspicious patterns—but also easy to erase
        evidence or cover for smugglers. The GM can use this to tie the Proficiency into faction play and fronts.

**GM usage notes:**When this Proficiency is in play, zoom out to show how entire districts or
        sectors respond. Use Clocks to represent congestion or escalating danger, and let successful Checks tick
        multiple segments when plans are well executed.

> **Example**
> **Example – Station Traffic Control**
A sabotage attempt targets a relay station during peak shift. The GM introduces a “Cascade Failure” Clock
>         and several Tags:*Crowded*,*Noisy*,*Alert Security*. A PC with Station Traffic
>         Control uses RSN + Systems & Diagnostics to re‑route trains and isolate damaged lines at DC 16 with
>         Edge. On a Full Success, they tick the Clock back and stabilize traffic. On a Partial, they prevent a
>         catastrophic collision but leave parts of the network shut down, creating political fallout in later
>         scenes.

### Lore & Research Proficiencies

Lore and research Proficiencies describe how your character interacts with records, stories, and hidden
        knowledge. They determine not just what you know, but how quickly and safely you can uncover deeper
        truths.

Lore & Research Proficiencies****************

| Proficiency             | What It Represents                                                        | Sample Uses                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Historical Archives     | Working with official records, registries, and long‑term documentation.   | Tracing property ownership; verifying lineage claims; finding inconsistencies in public reports.                      |
| Occult Librarianship    | Managing and interpreting collections of dangerous or esoteric texts.     | Identifying ritual scripts; recognizing censorship patterns; locating a specific grim fragment among scattered notes. |
| Cold‑Case Records       | Maintaining, cross‑referencing, and revisiting unresolved investigations. | Spotting links between old cases; recognizing recurring signatures; finding witnesses long after events.              |
| Academic Correspondence | Navigating scholarly networks, peer review, and institutional archives.   | Calling in favors for access; deciphering jargon; placing new findings in a larger theoretical context.               |

#### Historical Archives — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Historical Archives reflects experience with official records and how they are
        kept, altered, and lost. You know how registries are organized, which offices misfile frequently, and how
        to track paper (or digital) trails across bureaucracies.

**Scope and examples:**Land deeds, census records, guild rosters, shipping manifests, and
        legal proceedings. In play, this Proficiency supports investigations into who owns what, who was present
        where, and how institutions have changed claims over time.

**Default benefits:**Routine archive searches for straightforward information are automatic.
        For more complex tasks—like reconstructing a partially destroyed registry—Historical Archives lowers DCs
        on RSN + Investigation or RSN + Lore & Analysis Checks and may reduce the time required to sift
        through material.

**Opportunities and risks:**Archives reveal both truth and bias. The GM can use this
        Proficiency to highlight gaps, redactions, and contradictions, turning the act of research into a scene
        with stakes rather than a simple information drop.

**GM usage notes:**On Partial Success, consider providing accurate but incomplete data: the
        PCs learn enough to act, but not enough to avoid unintended consequences, which can drive future sessions.

> **Example**
> **Example – Historical Archives**
Searching for the origins of a disputed estate, a PC consults city ledgers. The GM calls for an RSN +
>         Lore & Analysis Check at DC 14, eased by Historical Archives. On a Full Success, they find an old map
>         and cross‑reference showing the estate’s boundaries shrinking over time, pointing toward quiet encroachment
>         by a neighbor. On a Partial, they recover only a subset of records, implicating the neighbor but leaving
>         room for plausible deniability.

#### Occult Librarianship — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Occult Librarianship covers the care, cataloging, and cautious study of
        dangerous or esoteric texts. You understand containment procedures, warning signs, and the subtle ways
        knowledge can warp those who engage with it.

**Scope and examples:**Interpreting marginalia in ritual manuals, identifying missing pages
        from a grim compendium, or recognizing when a “harmless” folk charm echoes a much older, riskier practice.

**Default benefits:**With this Proficiency, the GM will usually share more and safer context
        from strange texts without requiring a Check. When rolls are needed—often RSN + Lore & Analysis or RSN
        + Investigation—Occult Librarianship can justify Edge or reduce DCs, particularly when evaluating
        whether a ritual is incomplete or corrupt.

**Opportunities and risks:**This Proficiency naturally introduces fronts tied to forbidden
        research, missing tomes, or institutions that hide what they know “for the greater good.” It also tempts
        PCs to push beyond safe limits in pursuit of answers.

**GM usage notes:**Use Occult Librarianship to let players opt into horror or mystery at
        their own pace. On Partial Success, reveal enough to be useful but hint at deeper, more dangerous layers
        that require future scenes to explore.

> **Example**
> **Example – Occult Librarianship**
A PC examines a ritual folio tied to recent disappearances. The GM calls for an RSN + Lore & Analysis
>         Check at DC 16 with Edge due to Occult Librarianship. A Full Success reveals that the ritual is
>         missing a crucial protective stanza, explaining why the victims were unmade rather than transported. A
>         Partial identifies the ritual’s purpose but not its flaw, inviting the PCs to consider attempting it
>         themselves at great risk.

#### Cold‑Case Records — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Cold‑Case Records reflects long practice in maintaining and revisiting old,
        unresolved investigations. You know how evidence degrades, how witness stories shift, and how institutional
        priorities bury or revive cases.

**Scope and examples:**Re‑opening archived case files, comparing patterns of unsolved crimes,
        and tracing the careers of investigators who worked them. In play, this Proficiency helps you connect
        present events to older incidents others thought unrelated.

**Default benefits:**With Cold‑Case Records, the GM will often allow you to spot patterns
        without a roll when time is not an issue. When pressure mounts—limited access windows, political oversight,
        or active threats—this Proficiency improves RSN + Investigation Checks and may let you treat some Failures
        as Partial Successes that reveal leads but also awaken old enemies.

**Opportunities and risks:**Digging into cold cases can unsettle powerful factions and reopen
        wounds in communities. The GM can use this Proficiency to tie new mysteries into older tragedies, building
        a sense of continuity across arcs.

**GM usage notes:**On Partial Success, you might advance a “Truth Revealed” Clock while also
        ticking a “Past Comes Due” or “Retaliation” Clock, showing that progress has a cost.

> **Example**
> **Example – Cold‑Case Records**
The PCs suspect a recent arson is tied to decades‑old factory fires. The GM calls for an RSN + Investigation
>         Check at DC 15, with Cold‑Case Records granting Edge. A Full Success uncovers a pattern of suppressed
>         reports implicating the same family of contractors. A Partial connects the new fire to the old pattern but
>         also surfaces that the original investigator disappeared after filing their last report, adding a new layer
>         of danger.

### Medicine & Care Proficiencies

Medicine and care Proficiencies describe how characters stabilize others, manage long‑term health, and
        navigate medical institutions. They determine how safely you can push through dangerous Conditions and how
        quickly you can recover between crises.

Medicine & Care Proficiencies****************

| Proficiency          | What It Represents                                                              | Sample Uses                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Field Medicine       | Stabilizing injuries and illnesses with limited time and tools.                 | Binding wounds during a retreat; preventing shock; improvising splints from available materials.       |
| Clinical Practice    | Formal medical training within hospitals, clinics, or infirmaries.              | Diagnosing complex conditions; coordinating treatment teams; navigating medical hierarchies.           |
| Herbalism & Remedies | Using local plants, folk recipes, and traditional techniques to treat ailments. | Foraging for medicinal herbs; brewing tonics; providing long‑term support in low‑infrastructure areas. |
| Trauma Response      | Coordinating emergency care in chaotic, dangerous environments.                 | Setting up triage under fire; prioritizing patients; keeping panicked crowds away from hazards.        |

#### Field Medicine — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Field Medicine represents practical training in keeping people alive when
        resources are scarce and conditions are bad. You know how to improvise gear, recognize life‑threatening
        signs quickly, and decide when “good enough” is better than “perfect.”

**Scope and examples:**Battlefield triage, disaster relief, frontier clinics, and any scene
        where the nearest proper facility is hours away. In play, this Proficiency often pairs with Skills like
        Field Medicine (Skill) or Grit & Endurance to stabilize allies while under threat.

**Default benefits:**Routine first aid in safe contexts requires no roll. Under pressure,
        Field Medicine can reduce DCs on MIG or RSN Checks to treat Conditions like*Bleeding*or*Poisoned*, or justify Edge when you have minimal equipment but ample experience.

**Opportunities and risks:**This Proficiency invites the GM to present hard choices: which
        patient to treat first, what resources to expend now versus later, and how to balance the physical and
        emotional toll on caregivers.

**GM usage notes:**On Partial Success, let the PC stabilize a patient at a cost—perhaps the
        treatment introduces a new Condition like*Scarred*or ticks a Clock tracking supplies or morale.

> **Example**
> **Example – Field Medicine**
After an ambush on a mountain road, several allies are down. The GM sets a “Stabilize the Wounded” Clock
>         and notes Tags like*Hazardous*(falling rocks) and*Limited Supplies*. A PC with Field
>         Medicine makes a MIG + Field Medicine Skill Check at DC 15 with Edge. A Full Success both stabilizes
>         the worst injury and advances the Clock significantly. A Partial stabilizes the ally but depletes bandages
>         and drugs, adding a “Supply Shortage” Clock for the next leg of the journey.

#### Clinical Practice — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Clinical Practice reflects formal experience in organized medical settings:
        wards, clinics, research hospitals, or temple infirmaries. You know procedures, hierarchies, and how to
        coordinate multi‑step care.

**Scope and examples:**Diagnosing complex conditions, overseeing surgeries, managing
        long‑term treatment plans, and navigating paperwork and ethics boards. In play, this Proficiency often
        opens doors within institutions and lends authority when arguing for care.

**Default benefits:**Clinical Practice may remove the need to roll for routine care in
        well‑equipped settings. When Checks are necessary—such as rushing experimental treatment or pushing a
        facility past safe capacity—this Proficiency can grant Edge on RSN + Medicine or PRE + Command
        Checks.

**Opportunities and risks:**Institutional medicine is entangled with politics, funding, and
        social inequality. The GM can use this Proficiency to foreground conflicts over who receives care, who
        pays, and who decides.

**GM usage notes:**On Partial Success, let the medical outcome succeed but introduce
        institutional consequences: a reprimand, an audit, or a patient’s family owing a significant favor.

> **Example**
> **Example – Clinical Practice**
A PC attempts to secure an isolated ward for a contagious patient. The GM calls for a PRE + Command &
>         Coordination Check at DC 16, with Clinical Practice granting Edge. A Full Success gets the ward and
>         staff they need. A Partial success grants the ward but flags their actions to hospital leadership, adding
>         a “Administrative Scrutiny” Clock.

#### Trauma Response — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Trauma Response focuses on managing emergencies where medical, logistical,
        and psychological pressures collide. You know how to establish triage, communicate clearly, and keep
        people moving in the face of chaos.

**Scope and examples:**Mass‑casualty events, fires, structural collapses, and other crises
        that overwhelm normal systems. In play, this Proficiency allows PCs to coordinate both care and crowd
        control under extreme stress.

**Default benefits:**Trauma Response can reduce DCs or grant Edge on PRE + Command &
        Coordination, MIG + Grit & Endurance, or RSN + Systems & Diagnostics Checks tied to emergency
        management. It also justifies treating some Failures as Partial Successes where lives are saved but at the
        cost of resources, structural damage, or new Conditions.

**Opportunities and risks:**Characters with this Proficiency see the worst moments in a
        community. The GM can use it to spotlight resilience, burnout, and public trust—or lack thereof.

**GM usage notes:**When resolving large‑scale crises, pair this Proficiency with Clocks
        that represent both harm and response. Successful Checks should visibly bend the trajectory of disaster.

> **Example**
> **Example – Trauma Response**
During a station fire, a PC with Trauma Response organizes evacuees. The GM establishes parallel Clocks:
>         “Fire Spreads” and “Evacuation Complete.” A PRE + Command & Coordination Check at DC 17 benefits from
>         Trauma Response. On a Full Success, “Evacuation Complete” advances rapidly while “Fire Spreads” stalls.
>         On a Partial, both Clocks advance, saving many but leaving parts of the station damaged and some people
>         unaccounted for.

### Community & Institutions Proficiencies

Community and institutions Proficiencies describe how characters navigate social structures, from informal
        neighborhood networks to formal courts and unions. They are often about who listens to you and whose
        stories you can hear.

Community & Institutions Proficiencies****************

| Proficiency          | What It Represents                                                                     | Sample Uses                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Community Organizing | Bringing people together around shared concerns and goals.                             | Forming neighborhood watches; coordinating mutual aid; planning collective responses to threats. |
| Court Etiquette      | Understanding formal protocol, hierarchy, and unspoken rules in elite settings.        | Securing audiences; avoiding social missteps; reading power dynamics in ceremonies.              |
| Neighborhood Fixer   | Acting as a local problem‑solver and information broker.                               | Finding the right person for a job; smoothing over disputes; calling in favors quietly.          |
| Union Stewardship    | Representing workers, negotiating with management, and understanding labor structures. | Organizing strikes; negotiating contracts; shielding colleagues from retaliation.                |

#### Community Organizing — Role Proficiency

**Description:**Community Organizing reflects experience rallying neighbors, coworkers, or
        citizens around shared issues. You know who is trusted, what concerns resonate, and how to turn frustration
        into constructive action.

**Scope and examples:**Planning meetings, coordinating petitions, building coalitions across
        groups, and keeping momentum going between crises. In play, this Proficiency shapes how quickly and
        effectively communities respond to threats and opportunities.

**Default benefits:**Community Organizing often allows PRE + Persuasion & Appeal or PRE +
        Command & Coordination Checks to operate at lower DCs when you advocate for local needs, or grants
        Edge when the cause clearly aligns with community interests.

**Opportunities and risks:**Organized communities can change the course of campaigns—but
        organizing also paints targets on visible leaders. The GM can use this Proficiency to bring fronts focused
        on repression, co‑optation, or hard‑won victories into focus.

**GM usage notes:**On Partial Success, allow community movements to grow but introduce
        complications: internal disagreements, counter‑campaigns, or increased scrutiny from authorities.

> **Example**
> **Example – Community Organizing**
A factory district faces unsafe conditions. A PC with Community Organizing calls a meeting at a local hall.
>         The GM calls for a PRE + Persuasion & Appeal Check at DC 14 instead of 16, recognizing the Proficiency.
>         On a Full Success, workers form a unified committee and adopt a shared list of demands. On a Partial, they
>         agree to act but split into factions over tactics, giving the GM rich material for future sessions.

#### Court Etiquette — Role Proficiency

**Description:**Court Etiquette captures knowledge of formal protocol, titles, and ritualized
        behavior in elite spaces—royal courts, corporate boardrooms, high temples, or similar halls of power.

**Scope and examples:**Knowing how to address officials properly, when to speak or remain
        silent, which gifts are appropriate, and how to interpret seating arrangements or guest lists.

**Default benefits:**Court Etiquette can remove the need for rolls to avoid faux pas in
        formal settings. When Checks are required—such as persuading a council or reading the mood of a court—this
        Proficiency can lower DCs or grant Edge on PRE + Insight & Empathy or PRE + Persuasion &
        Appeal Checks.

**Opportunities and risks:**Courts and councils are rich with intrigue. The GM can use this
        Proficiency to expose hidden alliances, rivalries, and expectations, while also making the PC a known
        player in political games.

**GM usage notes:**On Partial Success, let PCs achieve their formal goals while entangling
        them socially—unexpected obligations, whispered rumors, or jealous rivals appear as a result of their
        presence.

> **Example**
> **Example – Court Etiquette**
Seeking support from a royal council, a PC presents a petition. Court Etiquette lets them bypass rolls to
>         gain entry and avoid simple missteps. The GM then calls for a PRE + Persuasion & Appeal Check at DC 16
>         with Edge. A Full Success wins backing with favorable terms. A Partial secures support but binds the
>         group to host a high‑profile event that will later draw unwelcome attention.

#### Neighborhood Fixer — Role Proficiency

**Description:**Neighborhood Fixer represents being the person people go to when they do not
        know where else to turn. You know who owes what to whom, which shortcuts exist, and how to arrange small
        miracles on short notice.

**Scope and examples:**Finding safe housing for someone in trouble, locating a discreet
        mechanic, or arranging a meeting between rivals. In play, this Proficiency often acts as a bridge between
        the PCs and the setting’s web of minor NPCs.

**Default benefits:**Neighborhood Fixer allows PCs to call in favors or identify useful
        contacts without rolls for low‑stakes matters. When stakes rise, this Proficiency can lower DCs on PRE +
        Streetwise or PRE + Deception & Performance Checks, or allow them to attempt delicate arrangements
        others could not.

**Opportunities and risks:**Being a fixer means being in the middle. The GM can complicate
        things by having multiple parties ask for incompatible help, or by making success in one favor create
        obligations to another faction.

**GM usage notes:**Use this Proficiency to keep the story moving when players are stuck, but
        balance it with favors owed. On Partial Success, let the PC secure what they want, but attach clear strings
        or time limits.

> **Example**
> **Example – Neighborhood Fixer**
The group needs a quiet space to meet a whistleblower. A PC with Neighborhood Fixer knows a café owner who
>         closes early. The GM lets them secure the space without a roll but calls for a PRE + Streetwise Check at
>         DC 13 to ensure no one follows them there. On a Full Success, the meeting is private and uneventful. On a
>         Partial, the meeting happens, but a curious local notices the unusual gathering and spreads rumors, adding
>         a “Neighborhood Gossip” Clock.

### Security & Covert Operations Proficiencies

Security and covert operations Proficiencies describe how characters interact with threats, surveillance,
        and the hidden movements of people and information. They determine who sees danger first, who can move
        unseen, and how institutions respond when lines are crossed.

#### Perimeter Security — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Perimeter Security reflects experience in setting up and reading physical
        defenses: fences, checkpoints, sensor grids, and patrol routes. You know what real protection looks like
        versus staged security meant only to deter casual intruders.

**Scope and examples:**Designing patrol patterns, placing alarms, evaluating access points,
        and exploiting weaknesses in existing setups. In play, this Proficiency can help you fortify a safehouse,
        quietly bypass a facility’s blind spot, or recognize when an enemy has deliberately left a gap as bait.

**Default benefits:**Routine assessments of basic perimeters require no roll. Under pressure,
        Perimeter Security can lower DCs or grant Edge on RSN + Investigation, RSN + Perception &
        Awareness, or AGI + Stealth & Evasion Checks related to security layouts and blind spots.

**Opportunities and risks:**This Proficiency naturally ties into Clocks representing
        escalating alerts or probing attacks. It also makes you a person of interest to both those who build
        security systems and those who wish to break them.

**GM usage notes:**Use Perimeter Security to keep infiltration scenes sharp but fair: a PC
        with this Proficiency should rarely be surprised by obvious defenses, but subtle or intentionally misleading
        setups can still create tense moments.

> **Example**
> **Example – Perimeter Security**
The PCs must slip into a relay control yard. The GM describes fences, towers, and patrols, then calls for an
>         RSN + Perception & Awareness Check at DC 15, modified by Perimeter Security. On a Full Success, the PC
>         identifies a blind spot between cameras and patrol arcs, granting Edge to the next AGI + Stealth &
>         Evasion Check for the group. On a Partial, they find a workable route but misjudge timing, ticking a “Guards
>         Suspicious” Clock as a light briefly sweeps across their path.

#### Criminal Underworld — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Criminal Underworld represents familiarity with illicit networks, black‑market
        channels, and the social rules that keep them running. You know who handles which trades, how word travels,
        and what lines even criminals hesitate to cross.

**Scope and examples:**Sourcing contraband, arranging discreet transportation, finding
        off‑the‑books muscle, and reading the reputations of crews and bosses. In play, this Proficiency often
        determines how much trouble comes attached to the favors you ask.

**Default benefits:**Simple underworld contacts or purchases may be handled without rolls,
        especially in familiar territory. When tension is high—crossing syndicates, dealing with informants, or
        trying to operate quietly in hostile turf—Criminal Underworld can lower DCs or grant Edge on PRE +
        Streetwise, PRE + Deception & Performance, or PRE + Persuasion & Appeal Checks.

**Opportunities and risks:**Underworld ties cut both ways. The GM can use this Proficiency to
        surface hooks like outstanding debts, rival enforcers, or opportunities to play factions against each
        other, as well as to show the consequences when things go wrong.

**GM usage notes:**On Partial Success, take care to show both the benefit and the cost:
        information arrives but so does a rival; a purchase goes through but the goods are tagged or flawed.

> **Example**
> **Example – Criminal Underworld**
The PCs want unregistered weapons before a risky job. A PC with Criminal Underworld knows which alley
>         warehouse to visit. The GM calls for a PRE + Streetwise Check at DC 14 with Edge. On a Full Success,
>         they secure the gear quietly. On a Partial, they get what they want, but the supplier quietly informs a
>         local boss that “something big is coming,” ticking a “Gang Interest” Clock.

#### Espionage Tradecraft — Domain Proficiency

**Description:**Espionage Tradecraft covers the techniques of spying and counter‑spying:
        surveillance detection, coded communication, infiltration planning, and the habits that keep agents alive.

**Scope and examples:**Establishing dead drops, creating and maintaining cover identities,
        detecting when conversations are being recorded, and planning entry and exit routes that leave few traces.

**Default benefits:**With this Proficiency, the GM may simply tell you when obvious
        surveillance is present or when your own operational security is clearly compromised. When a Check is
        appropriate—often AGI + Stealth & Evasion, PRE + Deception & Performance, or RSN + Investigation—
        Espionage Tradecraft can lower DCs or grant Edge, especially when the PC has had time to prepare.

**Opportunities and risks:**Tradecraft invites layered plots. The GM can use this Proficiency
        to build cat‑and‑mouse games where both PCs and NPCs are constantly testing each other’s preparations and
        assumptions.

**GM usage notes:**When resolving espionage scenes, think in terms of Clocks that track who
        has the advantage. On Partial Success, let the PC achieve their immediate goal but advance a Clock that
        represents an unseen opponent closing in.

> **Example**
> **Example – Espionage Tradecraft**
A PC must meet a contact in a café without revealing their interest to a watching faction. The GM sets a
>         “Surveillance Tightens” Clock and calls for a PRE + Deception & Performance Check at DC 16, modified
>         by Espionage Tradecraft. On a Full Success, the conversation happens naturally and the Clock does not
>         advance. On a Partial, the meeting succeeds but the Clock ticks, representing a shadowy observer noting
>         their pattern for future use.
