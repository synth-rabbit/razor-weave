# 1. Welcome to the Game

This Core Rulebook is the single source of truth for the system. It explains how to create characters,
        how to resolve uncertain moments, and how to build stories together across many different genres. You do
        not need to memorize the entire book before you play. You only need to know where to look when questions
        arise.

The rules are written with a fiction first mindset. The story comes first. Mechanics support the story
        when the outcome of an action is uncertain and meaningful. When the outcome is clear, you simply describe
        what happens and move on.

This game is built for cooperative play. The table is a creative team. Players bring characters to life.
        The**Game Master**presents the world, its challenges, and its opportunities. The rules help everyone answer
        a single question together: what happens next?

The chapters that follow will introduce the core concepts, show you how to use this book, and guide you
        through creating your first character. Later sections deepen the rules and provide tools for long running
        campaigns, solo journeys, and shared authority play.
