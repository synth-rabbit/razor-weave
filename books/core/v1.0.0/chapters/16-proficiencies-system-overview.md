## 16. Proficiencies System Overview

Proficiencies represent your character’s narrative domain expertise—their trades, callings, and areas of
        practiced familiarity. Where Skills describe how you act under pressure, Proficiencies describe what you
        already know and can do without needing to reinvent yourself on the spot. A licensed engineer, a guild
        advocate, and a long‑haul caravan driver might share some Skills, but their Proficiencies mark out very
        different lived experiences.

### What Proficiencies Represent

A**Proficiency**is more than a bonus—it is narrative permission. Being proficient in a domain means the GM
        can reasonably assume you understand its basics, jargon, and common risks. You know which questions to ask,
        which tools to reach for, and when a situation is outside your depth. In fiction, this might look like
        knowing how to secure a harness before climbing a relay tower, how to prepare a formal petition to a
        guild, or how to keep a steam engine from seizing during a storm.

Proficiencies often answer the question “Who gets to try this in the first place?” long before dice come
        out. In many situations, a Proficiency lets you bypass Checks entirely for routine tasks, or it sets a
        lower DC when you do roll because you are working from a position of experience rather than guesswork.

### Proficiencies, Skills, and Attributes

Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies work together. Attributes describe raw tendencies; Skills describe
        trained competencies; Proficiencies describe domains where that training has been applied over time. When
        you roll 4d6 for a Check, you typically choose an Attribute and a relevant Skill. A Proficiency then
        shapes the fiction around that roll: it might justify Edge, lower the DC, or remove uncertainty for
        basic tasks entirely.

For example, two characters might both have the Systems & Diagnostics Skill. The one who is proficient
        in “Relay Station Operations” can read console layouts at a glance, knows local safety procedures, and
        has authority to access restricted areas. The other must ask more questions, rely on guesswork, and may
        face higher DCs or additional Clocks tracking social or procedural friction.

Not every Check involving a Proficiency grants a numeric bonus. Sometimes the benefit is access, reduced
        time, or the ability to attempt actions at all. Let the fiction and the stakes guide whether a
        Proficiency grants Edge, adjusts DCs, or simply removes the need to roll for standard situations.

### Types of Proficiencies

Proficiencies are intentionally broad so they can flex across settings. Common types include:

- **Domain Proficiencies**– Fields of knowledge or practice, such as Medicine, Arcane Studies, or Relay Engineering.
- **Tool and Equipment Proficiencies**– Familiarity with particular implements, vehicles, or weapon classes.
- **Organization and Faction Proficiencies**– Deep understanding of how a group operates, from city watch procedures to smuggling rings.
- **Role and Status Proficiencies**– Experience tied to positions like Quartermaster, Scout Captain, or Court Envoy.

You do not need to track every possible niche as a separate Proficiency. Start with a small set that says
        who your character is and what the campaign cares about, then expand as the story reveals new, enduring
        areas of expertise.

### Using Proficiencies in Play

At the table, Proficiencies answer three questions: Who can attempt this? How hard is it for them? What
        happens if they get involved? When a situation touches a domain where a character is proficient, assume a
        higher baseline of competence, even before any dice hit the table. Routine tasks inside that domain often
        require no roll; they simply succeed, especially when there is no meaningful time pressure or opposition.

When the outcome is uncertain and meaningful, Proficiencies shape the Check rather than overshadowing it.
        A Proficiency might:

- Lower an otherwise tough DC by one or two steps on the ladder (for example from 18 Hard to 14 Routine).
- Justify Edge on the 4d6 roll when the task is firmly inside the character’s field.
- Reduce the time required to attempt something, ticking progress Clocks more quickly.
- Unlock options that would otherwise be off‑limits, such as restricted procedures or specialized tools.

Proficiencies also interact strongly with Tags, Conditions, and Clocks. A proficient harbor master might
        treat a*Crowded*and*Noisy*dock as normal working conditions, while an untrained visitor
        finds their DCs raised or their Partial Successes much messier. Likewise, a character proficient in
        “Crisis Negotiation” might convert certain Failures into Partial Successes when talking down a threat,
        because they know how to keep the conversation going even when their first approach falters.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Start with Permission**
When in doubt, treat Proficiencies as permission first and bonus second. Ask: “If no one at the table had
>         this Proficiency, would this scene be possible in the same way?” If the answer is no, the Proficiency
>         should change what the group can attempt, not just adjust numbers.

### Reading Proficiency Entries

Proficiency entries in the reference chapters mirror the structure of Skill entries, adapted for domain
        focus:

- **Name and type**– The Proficiency’s name and whether it is a domain, tool, organization, or role.
- **Description**– What this expertise looks like in the fiction and how it shapes the character’s daily life.
- **Scope and examples**– Typical situations where the Proficiency obviously applies, plus a few edge cases.
- **Default benefits**– Ways it commonly affects Checks: reduced DCs, Edge in certain circumstances, or automatic success for routine tasks.
- **Opportunities and risks**– Story hooks the GM can use when this expertise is present in a scene.
- **GM usage notes**– Guidance on when to ask for rolls, when to simply grant success, and how to model outcome tiers.
- **Example**– A short scenario showing the Proficiency in action, from Trigger to Consequence.

As with Skills, start with the description and example when you read a Proficiency entry. They show how
        the expertise changes scenes at the table; any bonuses or DC adjustments are there to support that story.

### Choosing Proficiencies at Character Creation

During Character Creation, you select a small number of Proficiencies that answer the question “What do I
        already know how to do well?” These choices sit alongside your Skills and Attributes and should reflect
        your history, training, and the kinds of stories you want to tell.

Aim for Proficiencies that:

- Fit your concept and the campaign’s focus.
- Offer clear, recurring hooks for the GM.
- Complement your Skills rather than duplicating them exactly.
- Say something about where you came from or who invested in your growth.

Talk with the GM and other players when choosing Proficiencies. Overlapping expertise can be fun, but
        shared blind spots—like a group with no one proficient in any kind of travel or logistics—will shape the
        tone of your campaign.

### Designing Proficiencies for Your Campaign

When you add new Proficiencies or adapt existing ones, aim for statements that are big enough to matter
        but small enough to feel distinct. “All Magic” is usually too broad; “Ritual Cartography of the Shattered
        Coast” may be too narrow for most scenes. A good Proficiency is something you expect to see at play at
        least a few times per arc, and that suggests concrete locations, NPCs, and problems.

As a rule of thumb:

- **Prefer phrases you could put on a business card.**“Harbor Operations,” “Restoration Carpentry,” or “Court Etiquette” are all solid examples.
- **Avoid pure mechanical labels.**“+2 to Hacking” describes a bonus, not a story. “Relay Network Security” suggests both.
- **Check overlap with Skills.**If a Proficiency sounds identical to a Skill, widen its scope or tilt it toward domain knowledge, contacts, or procedures.
- **Look for world hooks.**Ask yourself which factions, locations, or front pressures would naturally involve this expertise.

You can also collaborate to create campaign‑specific Proficiency lists. In a cozy slice‑of‑life game, you
        might see “Community Organizing,” “Bakery Management,” or “Local History.” In a horror‑mystery campaign,
        “Forensic Analysis,” “Occult Librarianship,” or “Missing Persons Desk” might emerge instead. The mechanical
        scaffolding stays the same; the labels change with the tone and focus of the series you are playing.

### Gaining and Advancing Proficiencies

Over time, you can gain new Proficiencies or deepen existing ones. Chapter 19: Advancement and Long‑Term
        Growth describes when these opportunities arise—often during Downtime, after major arcs, or as explicit
        rewards for in‑world training and mentorship.

When you broaden a Proficiency, its scope in the fiction grows: your guild credentials might expand from
        a single district to the entire region, or your “Field Medicine” experience might become full medical
        training with access to formal facilities. When you deepen a Proficiency, its impact on Checks may shift:
        the GM might grant Edge more often, treat certain tasks as automatically successful, or allow you to
        teach others more efficiently.

Proficiencies rarely stack into flat numeric bonuses. Instead, use them to decide who has access, whose
        word carries weight, and which characters can recognize danger before anyone else. Let them pull the
        story toward the areas of expertise your table cares about most.

### Genre Examples of Proficiencies

Because Proficiencies are narrative tools, they adapt easily across genres. A few possibilities:

- **Cozy & Slice‑of‑Life:**“Neighborhood Fixer,” “Community Kitchen,” “Library Steward,”
          “Garden Planner.” These Proficiencies often bypass rolls for everyday tasks and shine when tensions
          threaten comfort or belonging.
- **Fantasy & Mythic:**“Temple Rites,” “Royal Heraldry,” “Monster Tracking,” “Enchanted
          Smithing.” Here, Proficiencies may frequently unlock access to sacred spaces, secret orders, or rare
          materials rather than simply modifying DCs.
- **Horror & Mystery:**“Crime Scene Procedure,” “Urban Folklore,” “Cold‑Case Records,”
          “Sanitarium Administration.” These Proficiencies help stabilize investigatory scenes, reduce the risk of
          contaminating evidence, or warn the group about rituals and entities best left undisturbed.
- **Modern & Sci‑Fi:**“Traffic Control,” “Vacuum Safety,” “Synthetic Biology Labwork,”
          “Civilian Station Logistics.” These often interact with large systems and Clocks, turning Proficiencies
          into levers the PCs can pull to redirect institutional behavior.

You do not need to memorize long lists to play. Instead, treat these genre examples as prompts: what kinds
        of jobs, institutions, and long‑term projects exist in your world, and which Proficiencies would make
        those things feel real and lived‑in when they appear at the table?

> **Example**
> **Example – Proficiency in Action**
A PC with the “Harbor Operations” Proficiency and the Systems & Diagnostics Skill investigates a
>         gridlocked port. The GM rules that routine scheduling tasks are automatic successes—no roll required—because
>         the character knows the procedures. When they try to reroute traffic under pressure to prevent a collision,
>         the GM calls for a PRE + Systems & Diagnostics Check at DC 16. Their Proficiency justifies Edge
>         on the 4d6 roll and reduces the time required, ticking a “Clear the Harbor” Clock twice on a Full Success
>         and once on a Partial.
