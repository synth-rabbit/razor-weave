## 4. Core Principles of Play

This chapter explains the principles that shape every session of the game. These principles guide how
        players describe actions, how the GM presents situations, and how the table works together to move the
        story forward. They are not rules in the mechanical sense. They are values and habits that help the
        system produce consistent and engaging play.

The game uses a fiction first approach. You begin with the situation, decide what the characters do,
        and let the rules support the story when uncertainty and consequence appear. The principles below help
        the table maintain that flow.

### The Table Is a Creative Team

Every player at the table is part of the creative process. The GM presents the world. Players bring
        characters to life. The conversation between them becomes the engine of play. No one person controls
        the story. The table builds it together.

The GM describes locations, events, and pressures. Players respond by stating what their characters
        attempt. When the situation contains meaningful risk, the rules support the moment. In scenes that are
        calm or certain, the group continues the story through simple narration.

> **Example**
> **Example**The GM describes a run down depot on the outskirts of a coastal town. A player says their character
>         wants to scout the area quietly. Another player suggests checking the rail lines for signs of use. The
>         GM listens, considers what is true about this place, and describes what those actions reveal. No rule
>         is required yet. The table is building the fiction through conversation.

### Player Intent Drives Action

A player states what their character wants to accomplish. This is intent. They then explain how their
        character attempts it. This is approach. The GM uses intent and approach to decide whether the action
        succeeds automatically or whether risk is present.

Intent focuses the scene. Approach shapes which Attributes, Skills, or Proficiencies may apply. The
        rules always interpret a character's attempt in the context of the fiction, not as a puzzle of
        modifiers.

### The GM Presents the World Honestly

The GM is responsible for portraying the world clearly and fairly. This means describing situations
        honestly, sharing sensory details, and revealing information that the characters would reasonably
        perceive. The GM does not use surprises to punish the players. Instead, surprises serve the fiction and
        come from established threats or incomplete information.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Insight**Honesty does not mean revealing every detail. It means playing the world as it is, not as a tool to
>         control the players. Present danger when danger exists. Present opportunity when opportunity exists.

### Fiction First, Mechanics Second

Mechanics never replace the shared imagination of the table. Instead, they provide structure when the
        story reaches a point of risk or uncertainty. If no risk exists, the GM simply narrates the outcome of
        the player's action. This keeps the pace smooth and avoids unnecessary rules.

A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain, the stakes matter to the story, and
        failure or partial success would move the scene forward in an interesting way.

### Failure Creates Momentum

Failure is not an end point. It is a change in direction. When a Check fails, the story moves forward
        into a new state. This might introduce complications, new dangers, or shifts in position. Failure
        should never stop the story. It should bend it.

> **Example**
> **Example**A character tries to leap across a narrow canal. The Check fails. The GM does not say the character
>         falls into the water and nothing more happens. Instead, the GM describes how the character grabs a
>         rusted ladder, swings against the wall, and attracts the attention of guards nearby. The failure adds
>         motion to the scene.

### Partial Success Is a Core Story Beat

Partial success provides a result that sits between success and failure. The character achieves part of
        what they intended, but not all of it, or they succeed with a cost. This outcome creates tension,
        opportunity, and interesting decisions.

### The GM Describes Outcomes, Not Numbers

The players roll dice. The GM interprets the results in the fiction. A number never appears without
        narrative meaning. The GM describes what the dice reveal. The story changes in ways that make sense in
        the scene.

### Player Agency Comes From Clear Choices

Agency in this system comes from informed decision making. The GM describes situations in enough detail
        that players can understand what is at stake and choose their actions freely. When the stakes are clear,
        Checks feel meaningful and satisfying.

### The World Responds to Character Action

Every action changes the situation. When the players act, the GM updates the fiction. Threats advance.
        Opportunities emerge. Characters alter their position, their resources, or their standing with others.
        The world is not static. It reacts.

> **Example**
> **Example**A character tries to convince a merchant to delay a shipment. The Check is a partial success. The
>         merchant agrees to a delay, but only if the character promises to return a personal favor. The world
>         changes. The favor becomes a new thread in the story.

### Respect for Player Ownership

Players own their characters. They express their thoughts, motivations, and actions. The GM does not
        decide how a character feels or what a character chooses. The GM presents the world. Players choose how
        their characters engage with it.

### Scenes Have Direction

A good scene moves toward something. Sometimes this is an objective. Sometimes it is a revelation.
        Sometimes it is a moment of tension or a decision. The GM frames scenes with purpose. Players act with
        intent. Checks provide turning points.

### Trust at the Table

Trust supports everything. The GM trusts players to act with the fiction in mind. Players trust the GM
        to run the world honestly. The table trusts the system to provide structure when necessary. This trust
        allows everyone to play boldly.

### Chapter Summary

The principles in this chapter describe how the table works together. The GM presents the world
        honestly. Players express intent and approach. The fiction leads. Mechanics support. Failure creates
        momentum. Partial success adds tension. The world responds. Scenes have direction. Trust holds
        everything in place. The next chapter expands on these principles by showing how different modes of play
        shape the experience of the system.
