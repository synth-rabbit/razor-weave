## 5. Ways to Play the Game

This game supports multiple styles of play. Some groups meet weekly around a table. Others play online
        in short sessions. Some prefer a single player experience. Others use a shared world without a
        designated Game Master. The system is flexible and does not assume one standard format. The rules in
        later chapters work for all modes of play.

This chapter gives an overview of each play style. It also points to the sections of the book that
        support them. You do not need to choose one style forever. Many groups switch between modes depending on
        who is available or what kind of story they want to tell.

### Group Play With a GM

A group gathers with one person acting as Game Master. The GM presents the world, plays its**characters**,
        and describes the consequences of player actions. The**players control their own characters**and make
        decisions that drive the story forward.

### Duet Play

Duet play involves one player and one GM. It feels more intimate and often focuses on personal stories
        or character driven arcs. Scenes can shift quickly. The pacing is flexible.

### GMless Cooperative Play

In GMless play, the group shares narrative responsibility. No single person controls the world. Instead,
        the table uses procedures that rotate authority and help distribute scene framing, consequences, and
        world building. The game still uses the core resolution system, but each player takes turns providing
        challenges or interpreting outcomes.

### Solo Play

Solo play is designed for a single player. The player controls one or more characters and uses
        structured tools to emulate the world. These tools include prompts, oracles, and scene framing
        procedures. Solo play keeps the core mechanics intact.

### Asynchronous and Play by Post

Asynchronous play occurs through messages, email, shared documents, or online platforms. Players take
        turns responding when they have time. Because asynchronous play lacks immediate conversation, clarity
        is essential. Players describe intent and approach carefully. The GM presents outcomes with enough
        detail to move the story forward between posts.

### One Shot Sessions

A one shot is a complete adventure played in a single session. These sessions help introduce new
        players to the system and work well for conventions or special events. One shots focus on clear stakes
        and strong pacing.

### Campaign Play

A campaign is a longer story told over multiple sessions. Campaigns grow through character development,
        evolving threats, and unfolding consequences. The GM builds on player actions and uses tools like
        Clocks and Tags to maintain continuity.

### Hybrid Styles

Many tables blend modes. Some groups use solo play between sessions to develop character arcs. Others
        rotate GMless scenes inside a GM led campaign. Some begin with a one shot and transition into a long
        form campaign. The system supports these transitions without additional rules.

### Choosing the Right Mode

There is no single correct way to play. Each mode offers a different experience. Choose group play for
        shared storytelling and dynamic character interaction. Choose duet play for intimate stories. Choose
        GMless for collaborative world building. Choose solo play for personal exploration. Choose asynchronous
        play for flexible schedules. Choose one shots for quick adventures. Choose campaigns for deep, evolving
        narratives.

### Chapter Summary

This chapter described the supported modes of play. The system works whether you have one player or six,
        whether you have a GM or distribute authority, and whether you play in person or through messages. The
        next chapter introduces the character framework that supports all of these play styles.
