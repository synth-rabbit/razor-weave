## 24. NPCs, VPCs, and Enemies

Non‑player characters (NPCs), Virtual Player Characters (VPCs), and enemies are how the world speaks and
        pushes back. This chapter focuses on making them vivid in the fiction and easy to run at the table without
        heavy stat blocks.

### NPCs and VPCs Defined

**NPCs**are any characters controlled by the GM: allies, bystanders, antagonists, and
        everything in between. They provide texture, information, obstacles, and opportunities. Most NPCs appear
        occasionally and do not need the full mechanical detail of a player character.

**VPCs (Virtual Player Characters)**are GM‑run companions that fill out the party when there
        are not enough players. In solo play, a VPC might be the protagonist’s closest ally. In small groups, VPCs
        cover missing skills or roles so the party can tackle a wider range of challenges. They use the same rules
        as PCs but are run in a way that keeps decision‑making and spotlight with the human players.

Mechanically, there is still no strict line between an NPC and a VPC. The difference is about*function*.
        VPCs are built and advanced more like PCs and travel with the group session after session. NPCs, even
        important ones, usually appear in fewer scenes and can be represented with lighter stats. Both use Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks; VPCs simply do so from the “inside” of the party instead of the outside.

### VPC Roles and Spotlight

VPCs exist to support player characters, not replace them. They carry part of the mechanical load—extra
        Skills, coverage of missing Proficiencies, extra bodies in dangerous scenes—while leaving core decisions and
        moral weight in the players’ hands. Used well, they make solo and small‑party games feel like full ensembles
        without drowning out the human voices at the table.

As you design a VPC, decide what**party role**they fill. In a solo game, you might pair the
        protagonist with one or two VPCs who cover combat support, investigation, or social presence. In a three‑
        player group, you might add a VPC medic or logistics expert so that the party can survive harder scenarios.
        The VPC should clearly complement the party’s concept: filling gaps, not duplicating spotlight characters.

VPCs also help you manage spotlight, especially in solo play. When a lone player is unsure what to do next,
        a VPC can ask them a question in character or offer an imperfect plan that invites disagreement: “We could
        take the main road and risk the checkpoints, unless you see another way.” In group play, let VPCs speak up
        occasionally, then look to the PCs for final choices. Treat VPCs as mirrors and sounding boards, not as
        engines that drive the story on their own.

### VPC Arcs and Advancement

Just like PCs, VPCs change over time. Their Tags, Conditions, and relationships should evolve as fronts
        advance and as they succeed or fail alongside the group. You do not have to track their advancement as
        precisely as a full player sheet, but you should know how each major arc has affected them.

After an arc concludes, ask a few questions about each important VPC. What did they gain or lose while
        travelling with the party? Did any of their core beliefs shift in response to the PCs’ choices? Have they
        earned a new edge Condition such as*Backed by Authority*,*Trusted by the Crew*, or*Carrying Quiet Doubts*? Updating a handful of Tags and notes is often enough to keep them feeling
        alive.

When a VPC’s journey reaches a natural end—retirement, promotion, settling down, moving on to another
        mission—mark it as a major moment in the campaign. In solo and small‑party games, the departure of a VPC can
        be as emotionally significant as a PC advancement or sacrifice. Give those moments space at the table: short
        epilogues, good‑bye scenes, or opportunities to see how the VPC’s life continues off‑screen.

### Building Compelling NPCs

Start with role, desire, and a few details. Then layer on Tags and relationships.

Begin with their**role**. What job or social function do they fulfill? Dock quartermaster,
        archivist, street medic, minor noble, maintenance engineer—all of these roles say something about who the
        character meets, what they know, and where they spend their time. Role anchors the NPC in the setting’s
        everyday life.

Add a clear**desire**: what do they want right now, in this phase of the story? Some desires
        are small and immediate (“finish this shift and go home”), others long‑term (“prove my theory about the
        anomalies in the telegraph lines”). Desire tells you how they will react when the PCs ask for help or push
        against their boundaries.

Choose one or two**details**that make the NPC easy to remember: a gesture, a pattern of
        speech, a recurring prop, a particular smell. Details should be quick to note and easy to bring back later.
        Over time, you can add more, but even a single consistent trait goes a long way.

Finally, assign a few**Tags**that describe attitude, resources, or vulnerabilities:*Overworked*,*Soft‑Spoken*,*Connected to the Docks*,*Haunted by Loss*.
        These Tags help you improvise DC shifts, Edge or Burden, and likely consequences. They also make
        it clear what might change if the PCs support or pressure this NPC over many sessions.

> **Example**
> **Example – quick NPC**
*Marla, Dock Quartermaster*– Role: gatekeeper for cargo. Desire: avoid trouble and keep shipments
>         moving. Details: ink‑stained fingers, never looks up from the ledger. Tags:*Overworked*,*Pragmatic*,*Knows the Rumor Network*.

### Designing Strong VPCs

VPCs use the same ingredients as other NPCs—role, desire, details, Tags—but you layer them more densely.
        They benefit from clear**trajectories**: questions about where they might end up if no one
        intervenes, and how the PCs might alter that path.

When you create a VPC, write down two or three possible destinations for their arc. For example, a young
        inspector might end up as a trusted ally inside the bureaucracy, a disgraced whistleblower on the run, or a
        hardened enforcer who closes ranks against the PCs. You do not need to decide which outcome will occur in
        advance. Let Clocks, Tags, and play at the table reveal it.

Treat important VPCs as candidates for**Edge and Burden anchors**. When they are
        present in a scene, their Tags should influence DCs and dice pools. A VPC tagged*Respected in the
        Union*might grant Edge on negotiations with workers, while one tagged*Burned Too Many
        Bridges*might impose Burden in those same conversations. This mechanical weight signals their
        importance without requiring complex stat blocks.

### Enemies and Opposition

Enemies are NPCs, creatures, or forces that actively oppose the characters. Instead of complex stat blocks,
        focus on what makes them dangerous and how they change the fiction.

Give each enemy a clear**threat concept**—a short phrase that captures why they matter:
        “relentless hunter,” “arsonist cell,” “ancient machine,” “quiet propagandist.” This concept guides
        everything else: how they move, what they target, what they ignore.

From that concept, define a few**moves**or typical actions that express the threat in play.
        A relentless hunter appears where characters feel safe; an arsonist cell strikes where security is thin and
        escape routes are narrow; an ancient machine reshapes the environment in ways that ignore political
        boundaries. You do not need a long list—two or three moves that you can deploy flexibly are enough.

Attach**Tags**and**Clocks**to their presence so the threat interacts cleanly
        with the rest of the system. “Pinned Down,” “Reinforcements Arrive,” and “Override Sequence Active” are all
        examples of how an enemy’s progress can be tracked and felt. When you advance an enemy Clock, describe what
        happens in the fiction; when a Tag changes, show what new opportunities or dangers appear.

> **Example**
> **Example – Enemy with Clocks**
A masked arsonist group operates in the industrial district. Tags:*Fanatical*,*Mobile*.
>         Moves: strike where security is thin, spread fear through rumors. Clocks:*Fires Escalate*(4‑segment)
>         and*Public Blames the Wrong People*(6‑segment).

### Running NPCs in Checks and Combat

When NPCs and enemies act, use the same resolution structure as you do for characters. Checks, Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks keep everyone on the same footing.

Use**NPC Tags**to adjust DCs or apply Edge and Burden when they attempt actions.
        A veteran duelist with Tags like*Calm Under Fire*and*Reads Footwork*should feel harder to
        deceive or disarm than a bored guard tagged*Distracted*. The same framework from Chapter 8 applies:
        Tags describe position and effect, which in turn shape DCs and dice.

Use**Conditions**to mark injury, fear, leverage, or doubt instead of tracking detailed hit
        points or morale scores. An enemy who is*Wounded*,*Shaken*, or*Cornered*behaves
        differently from one who is fresh and confident. For VPCs, Conditions can track emotional or political
        states (“On Thin Ice with the Council,” “Carrying Survivors’ Guilt”) that matter as much as physical harm.

Use**Clocks**to represent an enemy’s—or a VPC’s—progress toward a goal rather than counting
        down every individual blow or argument. A “Duel Slips Out of Control” Clock can fill as tempers flare,
        regardless of who is technically “winning” each exchange. A “Council Sways to Our Side” Clock might track a
        VPC’s political campaign in the background while the PCs pursue other fronts.
