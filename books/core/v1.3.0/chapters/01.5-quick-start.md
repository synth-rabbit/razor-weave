## 1.5 Quick-Start Guide

Welcome to Razorweave! This chapter gets you playing in 30 minutes. Everything you need for your first session is here: simplified rules, pre-made characters, and a complete adventure. You can explore the full rulebook later—for now, let's play.

---

### What You Need

To play Razorweave, gather these essentials:

- **4-6 players**: One person is the Game Master (GM) who describes the world and plays supporting characters. The rest are players who create and control their own characters.
- **Character sheets**: Use the pre-generated characters provided later in this chapter, or make simple notes on paper.
- **4d6 per player**: Four six-sided dice for each player. You can share, but having your own set speeds up play.
- **2-3 hours**: Your first session. Future sessions can be shorter or longer depending on your group's preference.

The GM describes situations, players describe what their characters do, and dice determine outcomes when success is uncertain. That's the entire game loop. Everything else is just detail.

---

## The Core Rules

These condensed rules cover everything you need for your first session. Full explanations appear in later chapters, but you can play right now with what's here.

### Your Character

Every character has four **Attributes** rated from 0 to 2:

- **Might (MIG)**: Physical strength, endurance, and toughness
- **Agility (AGI)**: Speed, precision, and reflexes
- **Presence (PRE)**: Charisma, social influence, and force of personality
- **Reason (RSN)**: Analysis, knowledge, and problem-solving

A rating of **2** means you're exceptional in that area. A **1** means you're competent. A **0** means you're average or weak—you can still try, but success is less certain.

**Skills** represent training in specific actions. If you have a relevant Skill (like Stealth, Persuasion, or Athletics), you add **+1** to your roll. Skills are simple: you either have one or you don't.

**Proficiencies** represent specialized knowledge or tool familiarity. They don't add numbers—instead, they let you attempt things others can't or give you advantages (explained below).

### Making Checks

When your character tries something risky where success isn't guaranteed, the GM calls for a **Check**. Here's how:

1. **Roll 4d6**: Roll four six-sided dice
2. **Keep the best 3**: Drop the lowest die, add the remaining three together
3. **Add your Attribute**: Add the relevant Attribute value (0, 1, or 2)
4. **Add +1 if you have a relevant Skill**: If one of your Skills applies, add 1
5. **Compare to the DC**: The GM sets a Difficulty Class (DC) you're trying to beat

**Example**: Tomas tries to climb a fence while guards chase him. The GM calls for an AGI Check, DC 12. Tomas rolls 4d6 and gets 3, 4, 5, 2. He drops the 2, adds 3+4+5=12, then adds his AGI 1 for a total of **13**. That beats DC 12—he makes it over the fence!

### Difficulty Classes (DCs)

The GM picks a DC based on how hard the task is:

| Difficulty | DC | When to Use |
|------------|----|----|
| **Easy** | 12 | Favorable conditions, straightforward task |
| **Routine** | 14 | Standard difficulty, typical challenge |
| **Tough** | 16 | Difficult task, hostile conditions |
| **Hard** | 18 | Very challenging, serious obstacles |

For your first session, use **DC 12** for easy tasks and **DC 14** for most others. Save DC 16 for climactic moments.

### Outcomes

Compare your total roll to the DC to determine the outcome:

| Result | Outcome | What Happens |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **18 or higher** | **Critical Success** | You succeed spectacularly. The GM describes an extra benefit. |
| **13-17 (beat DC)** | **Full Success** | You accomplish exactly what you intended. |
| **8-12 (close but miss)** | **Partial Success** | You succeed, but there's a cost, complication, or compromise. |
| **7 or lower** | **Failure** | Things go wrong. The situation gets worse. |

**Example Outcomes**: Using Tomas from before (rolled 13 vs DC 12):
- **If DC was 12**: Full Success—he clears the fence cleanly
- **If DC was 14**: Partial Success—he makes it over but tears his coat, loses an item, or lands badly
- **If DC was 16**: Failure—he doesn't make it over, or falls on the other side in a bad position

### Edge and Burden

Sometimes circumstances help or hinder you. The GM can grant **Edge** (advantage) or **Burden** (disadvantage):

**Edge +1**: Roll one extra die (5d6 instead of 4d6) and keep the best 4 before dropping the lowest. Use this when conditions favor you—good lighting for sneaking, assistance from an ally, ideal weather, proper tools.

**Burden -1**: Roll one extra die (5d6 instead of 4d6) and keep the worst 4 before dropping the lowest. Use this when conditions work against you—dim lighting for precision work, wounded, working with improvised tools.

Edge and Burden cancel out. If you have +1 Edge and -1 Burden, roll normally (4d6).

**Example**: Sera tries to pick a lock. She has Lockpicking Tools (Proficiency), so the GM gives her Edge +1. She rolls 5d6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. She keeps the best four (3, 4, 5, 6), then drops the lowest of those (the 3). She adds 4+5+6=15, plus her AGI 2, plus her Lockpicking Skill +1, for a total of **18**. The lock opens easily.

### Combat Basics

When fighting breaks out, follow this structure:

**Turn Order**: For your first session, use simple conversational turn order—the GM and players alternate naturally. The GM can have multiple enemies act on a single "GM turn."

**Your Turn**: On your turn, you can:
- **Move**: Walk or run a reasonable distance (about 30 feet)
- **Take one action**: Strike an enemy, help an ally, use an item, or attempt something creative

**Core Combat Actions**:
- **Strike**: Attack an enemy. Roll 4d6 + Attribute (usually MIG or AGI) + Combat Skill if you have one, vs DC 14. Success deals damage (see below).
- **Maneuver**: Reposition, create obstacles, grab something, push someone. Roll 4d6 + Attribute vs DC 12-14.
- **Set Up**: Create an advantage for yourself or an ally. Roll 4d6 + Attribute vs DC 12. Success creates a beneficial situation that grants Edge on the next relevant action.
- **Defend/Withdraw**: Protect yourself or escape. Roll 4d6 + Attribute vs DC 12-14 depending on the threat.

**Damage and Being Taken Out**: Instead of hit points, characters have a **Resolve Clock**—a track with 6 segments. When you're successfully struck in combat:
- **Critical Success** (attacker's margin +5 or more): Fill 3 segments
- **Full Success** (attacker beats DC): Fill 2 segments
- **Partial Success** (attacker close but misses): Fill 1 segment
- **Failure** (attacker misses): No damage

When your Resolve Clock fills completely (6 segments), you're **taken out**—knocked unconscious, forced to surrender, or flee. You're not dead unless the story demands it, but you can't keep fighting.

**Example Combat Round**:
*Rella fights a bandit. Both start with empty 6-segment Resolve Clocks.*

**Rella's Turn**: "I strike at his weapon arm." She rolls 4d6 + AGI 2 = 16 vs DC 14. **Full Success**—2 segments filled on the bandit's clock (2/6).

**Bandit's Turn**: He swings back. GM rolls for the bandit: 13 vs DC 14. **Partial Success**—1 segment filled on Rella's clock (1/6).

*The fight continues until one Resolve Clock fills.*

### That's Everything

You now know enough to play. The rules above handle 90% of situations. When something unusual comes up, the GM makes a ruling and play continues. You can look up detailed rules later—for now, dive in with the pre-generated characters and the adventure below.

---

## Pre-Generated Characters

Choose one of these three characters for your first session. Each represents a common archetype and shows how Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies work together.

### The Tank: Garrick Ironhand

**Concept**: Dockyard enforcer who solves problems through physical presence and intimidation.

**Why play this character**: You enjoy being the tough one. You excel in combat and physical challenges. When things need to be broken, moved, or intimidated, you're the answer. Let your teammates handle the talking and thinking—you're here to protect them and handle threats directly.

**Attributes**:
- **Might (MIG)**: 2 — Exceptional strength and toughness
- **Presence (PRE)**: 1 — Intimidating when needed
- **Agility (AGI)**: 1 — Basic mobility
- **Reason (RSN)**: 0 — Acts on instinct, not analysis

**Skills**: Brawling, Endurance, Intimidation, Athletics

**Proficiencies**: Dockyard Work, Heavy Tools

**Starting Gear**:
- Heavy work clothes (provides some protection)
- Crowbar (useful tool and improvised weapon)
- Rope (50 feet)
- Belt pouch with 10 silver coins
- Lucky brass knuckles (sentimental item from first job)

**Connection**: Marta, the dock foreman who gave you your first job. You owe her loyalty, and she occasionally sends work your way.

**What You're Good At**:
- **Fighting**: You hit hard and reliably. Rolling 4d6 + MIG 2 + Brawling 1 = average 17 vs DC 14. You succeed most of the time.
- **Physical Challenges**: Breaking doors, moving heavy objects, enduring hardship. You rarely fail when strength matters.
- **Intimidation**: When you need to threaten or coerce, PRE 1 + Intimidation 1 gets you far, especially backed by your physical presence.

**What You Struggle With**:
- **Complex Thinking**: RSN 0 means puzzles, investigation, and analysis are hard. Let your teammates figure out the mystery—you focus on the action.
- **Social Finesse**: You can intimidate, but persuasion and deception aren't your strength. Let the Face talk when charm is needed.

**Combat Tactics**: Get up close and Strike. You're tough enough to absorb damage. Use Intimidation to make enemies hesitate. Protect allies who are less durable.

**Quick Background**: You grew up on the docks, doing hard labor for hard people. You learned that problems can be solved with muscle and reputation. People respect strength—or at least fear it—and you've built a reputation as someone who gets physical jobs done. You're loyal to those who've earned it and have no patience for complicated schemes.

---

### The Face: Sera Vane

**Concept**: Traveling merchant who navigates social networks and avoids physical confrontation.

**Why play this character**: You enjoy talking your way through problems. You excel at persuasion, deception, gathering information, and reading people. You make friends, cut deals, and turn enemies into allies. When violence erupts, you talk it down or slip away—you're here to solve problems with words, not weapons.

**Attributes**:
- **Presence (PRE)**: 2 — Exceptional charm and social influence
- **Agility (AGI)**: 1 — Quick enough to escape danger
- **Reason (RSN)**: 1 — Sharp enough to read situations
- **Might (MIG)**: 0 — Not physically imposing

**Skills**: Persuasion, Deception, Empathy, Negotiation

**Proficiencies**: Trade Networks, Urban Navigation

**Starting Gear**:
- Fine traveling clothes (marks you as someone of means)
- Small lockbox with trade documents
- Silver merchant's ring (proof of guild membership)
- Belt pouch with 25 silver coins
- Small knife (practical tool, emergency weapon)

**Connection**: Jorin, a rival merchant who competes for the same contracts. Your relationship is complicated—you respect each other but constantly try to outmaneuver one another.

**What You're Good At**:
- **Social Interaction**: You excel at persuasion and negotiation. Rolling 4d6 + PRE 2 + Persuasion 1 = average 17 vs DC 14. You talk your way through most situations.
- **Information Gathering**: Between Empathy, RSN 1, and your social Skills, you learn secrets others miss.
- **Evasion**: AGI 1 means you can escape when talking fails. You're not a fighter—you're a survivor.

**What You Struggle With**:
- **Combat**: MIG 0 and no combat training mean fights are dangerous. Avoid them, talk them down, or flee.
- **Physical Challenges**: Heavy lifting, breaking through barriers, enduring hardship—you need help or clever alternatives.

**Combat Tactics**: Avoid fighting. If combat starts, try to negotiate or retreat. If forced to fight, use AGI for quick strikes and disengage immediately. Let tougher allies handle prolonged fights.

**Quick Background**: You've spent years traveling trade routes, learning that people are the real currency. You know how to read a room, make an impression, and turn suspicion into trust. You've talked your way out of more trouble than most people will ever see, and you've made enough coin to live comfortably. Violence is messy and bad for business—you prefer deals everyone walks away from.

---

### The Specialist: Rella

**Concept**: Former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns.

**Why play this character**: You enjoy solving technical problems and uncovering mysteries. You excel at observation, working with machinery, and moving quietly through dangerous spaces. You notice details others miss, fix things that are broken, and handle delicate work under pressure. You're competent in many areas without dominating any single one.

**Attributes**:
- **Reason (RSN)**: 2 — Analytical mind, pattern recognition
- **Agility (AGI)**: 1 — Steady hands, careful movement
- **Presence (PRE)**: 1 — Quiet competence
- **Might (MIG)**: 0 — Physical labor isn't your strength

**Skills**: Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, Machinery Handling

**Proficiencies**: Telegraph Instruments, Precision Tools

**Starting Gear**:
- Practical layered clothing with tool belt
- Compact technical toolkit
- Notebook filled with cipher fragments and observations
- Insulated lantern
- Belt pouch with 15 silver coins

**Connection**: Isten, a former coworker and mentor. Your friendship ended over a dispute about unsafe repair methods. You wonder if the relationship can be repaired, or if you were right to walk away.

**What You're Good At**:
- **Observation and Investigation**: RSN 2 + Observation means you spot details and connect patterns. Rolling 4d6 + RSN 2 + Observation 1 = average 17 vs DC 14.
- **Technical Work**: You repair, modify, and understand machinery. Your Proficiencies with tools and instruments give you Edge on relevant tasks.
- **Stealth**: AGI 1 + Stealth means you move quietly. You're not the best infiltrator, but you can sneak when needed.

**What You Struggle With**:
- **Physical Strength**: MIG 0 makes heavy lifting, breaking obstacles, and enduring hardship difficult. Find clever solutions or ask for help.
- **Social Leadership**: PRE 1 is adequate but not exceptional. You can connect with individuals, but don't try to lead crowds or dominate negotiations.

**Combat Tactics**: Avoid direct confrontation. Use Stealth to gain positioning advantages. Strike from surprise or support allies by identifying enemy weaknesses (using Observation). You're competent but not a front-line fighter.

**Quick Background**: You spent years maintaining telegraph relay stations in canyon settlements, logging message patterns and keeping delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. You started noticing anomalies—patterns that shouldn't exist, messages that made no sense. When you reported them, supervisors dismissed your concerns. You left your position to investigate independently, which led you to your current situation. You're driven by curiosity and a need to understand what you've uncovered.

## Your First Adventure: The Missing Merchant

This scenario introduces basic rules through a structured adventure. It includes social interaction, exploration, and combat—the three main types of scenes in Razorweave.

**For the GM**: Read this entire section before starting. You'll describe scenes, play NPCs, call for Checks, and narrate outcomes. Don't worry about getting everything perfect—focus on keeping the game moving and describing what happens.

**For Players**: Listen to the GM's descriptions, ask questions, and describe what your characters do. The GM will tell you when to roll dice.

### Setup: The Missing Merchant

**Opening narration for the GM**:

> "You've arrived in Millhaven, a small trading town where two rivers meet. The place is busy—merchants haggling, dockworkers loading boats, travelers coming and going. You're here because a local merchant named Corvin Tresh hired you three days ago for a simple job: escort a trade shipment from Millhaven to Greywater, a settlement two days' journey downriver.
>
> But Corvin never showed up yesterday morning as planned. His business partner, a nervous woman named Elara, tracked you down at your inn. She's worried—Corvin left two days ago to finalize arrangements at a nearby logging camp, and he should have returned by now. She's offering double your original fee if you find him and bring him back safely. She suspects he ran into trouble on the forest road.
>
> What do you do?"

**Key Information**:
- Corvin Tresh is a grain merchant, middle-aged, cautious by nature
- He left two days ago heading north to Oakridge Logging Camp, a 4-hour walk
- The forest road is usually safe, but bandits have been reported in the area recently
- Elara is offering 50 silver coins (total) to find Corvin and bring him back

**Goal**: The players need to investigate Corvin's disappearance, track him through the forest, and rescue him from bandits.

---

### Scene 1: Gathering Information

**Purpose**: Introduce social Checks and information gathering.

**Location**: Millhaven town center, docks, or taverns.

**What's Happening**: The players can question witnesses and gather clues before heading into the forest. They should learn:
1. Corvin took the north forest road toward Oakridge Camp
2. Two travelers saw a merchant matching his description yesterday afternoon
3. Bandits have been spotted near the old mill ruins, about halfway to Oakridge
4. Corvin's horse returned to town without him last night

**NPCs to Question**:

**Elara (Corvin's partner)**: Nervous, distracted, genuinely worried. She knows Corvin's route and schedule.
- **DC 12 PRE Check (Persuasion or Empathy)**: She reveals Corvin was carrying 100 silver coins to pay the loggers
- **DC 14 PRE Check**: She admits Corvin has been acting strangely lately, mentioning strange sounds in the forest

**Old Tam (dockworker)**: Gruff, seen everything. Sits near the docks smoking a pipe.
- **DC 12 PRE Check (Persuasion or Negotiation)**: He saw Corvin leave two days ago, heading north, alone
- **DC 14 PRE Check**: For the price of a drink (1 silver), he mentions bandits have a camp near the old mill ruins—he's heard rumors from travelers

**Mira (stablehand)**: Young, observant, cares about the horses.
- **DC 12 RSN or PRE Check (Empathy)**: She saw Corvin's horse return last night, spooked and sweating, still saddled
- **DC 14 RSN Check (Observation)**: She points out dried blood on the saddle—not much, but enough to show something happened

**Running This Scene**:
1. Let players decide how to investigate. Some might split up, others might stick together.
2. Call for Checks when they try to convince reluctant NPCs or notice subtle details.
3. Players don't need to question all three NPCs—two conversations should give them enough information.
4. Once players know the route and the bandit connection, they'll likely head north.

**GM Tip**: If players struggle or don't know what to do, have Elara suggest questioning people who might have seen Corvin leave, or have an NPC volunteer information without requiring a Check.

---

### Scene 2: Tracking Through the Forest

**Purpose**: Introduce exploration Checks and environmental challenges.

**Location**: The north forest road leading to Oakridge Camp.

**What's Happening**: The players follow the forest road north. After about two hours of walking, they reach the area where Corvin was ambushed. They need to find clues and track him to the bandit camp.

**The Ambush Site**:

Read this when players reach the halfway point:

> "The forest road narrows here, with thick underbrush on both sides. The ground shows signs of a struggle—disturbed dirt, broken branches, and hoofprints that stop suddenly. Something happened here."

**Clues to Find**:

**DC 12 RSN Check (Observation)**: Players notice:
- Tracks from multiple people (3-4 individuals) leading west off the road
- Drag marks suggesting someone was pulled or carried
- A torn piece of expensive cloth (Corvin's coat) caught on a bush

**DC 14 RSN Check (Observation)**: Additional details:
- The tracks are fresh—less than a day old
- One set of prints is deep and uneven, suggesting someone carrying a burden
- Faint smell of wood smoke to the west—someone has a camp nearby

**Following the Tracks**:

**DC 12 RSN Check (Tracking or Survival)**: Players successfully follow the trail west through the forest toward the old mill ruins.

**Failure or Partial Success**: They lose the trail briefly, taking extra time, or they follow correctly but make noise, alerting the bandits (gives bandits time to prepare—see Scene 3).

**The Approach**:

After 30 minutes of tracking, players approach the bandit camp:

> "Through the trees ahead, you see the ruins of an old mill—stone walls half-collapsed, the waterwheel long gone. Smoke rises from a small campfire. You hear voices—two, maybe three people. One voice is higher-pitched, pleading: 'I already told you, the money's back in town! Let me go and I'll bring it to you!' That might be Corvin."

**Stealth Approach (Optional)**:

If players want to sneak closer and observe before acting:

**DC 12 AGI Check (Stealth)**: Players get close enough to see the camp layout without being spotted:
- Three bandits (two near the fire, one on watch)
- Corvin tied to a post near the ruins
- The bandits are armed with clubs and knives
- There's a clear path from the east side that provides cover

**DC 14 AGI Check (Stealth)**: Players also notice:
- The guard on watch is distracted and not paying close attention
- One bandit is injured (bandaged arm)—easier to fight
- The bandits' weapons are within reach but not currently held

**Failure**: The guard spots movement. The bandits grab their weapons and call out: "Who's there? Show yourselves!" Combat begins with the bandits prepared (no surprise advantage).

**Running This Scene**:
1. Let players decide how to approach—stealth, direct confrontation, or trying to negotiate.
2. Reward creative solutions. If they create a distraction to lure bandits away, that might avoid combat.
3. The goal is rescuing Corvin, not necessarily killing all the bandits.

---

### Scene 3: Confronting the Bandits

**Purpose**: Introduce combat with a manageable encounter.

**Location**: The old mill ruins and bandit camp.

**The Bandits**:

**Bandit Leader (Torvin)**:
- **Resolve Clock**: 6 segments
- **Attributes**: MIG 1, AGI 1, PRE 1, RSN 0
- **Skills**: Intimidation, Brawling
- **Weapon**: Club (counts as simple weapon, uses MIG for Strikes)
- **Tactics**: Torvin tries to intimidate first, fights aggressively if that fails. He's a bully, not a soldier.

**Bandit 1 (Kess)**:
- **Resolve Clock**: 6 segments
- **Attributes**: MIG 1, AGI 1
- **Skills**: Brawling
- **Weapon**: Knife
- **Tactics**: Kess stays close to Torvin, supporting him. If badly hurt, will surrender.

**Bandit 2 (Rol)**:
- **Resolve Clock**: 4 segments (injured from earlier fight with Corvin)
- **Attributes**: MIG 0, AGI 1
- **Weapon**: Knife
- **Tactics**: Rol is already wounded and not eager to fight. First to flee or surrender.

**Corvin (the merchant)**:
- Tied up, unarmed, not a threat. If freed, he'll flee to safety and won't participate in the fight.

**Starting the Fight**:

If players try to negotiate:
- **DC 14 PRE Check (Persuasion or Intimidation)**: Torvin considers letting Corvin go if paid 100 silver (the amount Corvin was carrying). He's suspicious but willing to deal.
- **DC 16 PRE Check**: Torvin releases Corvin for 50 silver, grumbling but intimidated by the group.
- **Failure**: Torvin laughs and draws his club. "You think you can threaten *us*? We're taking your coin too!" Combat begins.

If players attack:
- Initiative is conversational—players act first if they surprised the bandits, otherwise GM and players alternate.

**Running the Combat**:

**Round 1**: Torvin tries to intimidate: "Back off or the merchant dies!"
- If players waver, Torvin pulls a knife on Corvin.
- If players press forward, Torvin realizes he's outmatched and fights.

**Suggested Combat Flow**:
- Torvin fights until his Resolve Clock hits 4/6 segments, then tries to retreat
- Kess fights until Torvin goes down, then surrenders
- Rol flees or surrenders after taking any significant damage (2+ segments)

**Bandit Combat Actions**:
- **Strike (DC 14)**: Bandits roll 4d6 + MIG 1 (or AGI 1 for knives) + Brawling 1 (if applicable). Average roll: 15
  - **Full Success**: 2 segments on target's Resolve Clock
  - **Partial Success**: 1 segment
- **Maneuver**: Try to grab a PC, create obstacles, or reposition. DC 12-14 depending on action.

**Player Combat Actions**:
- Players use Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend as described in Core Rules.
- The Tank (Garrick) should Strike reliably. The Face (Sera) should use Persuasion or disengage. The Specialist (Rella) should observe and strike from advantageous positions.

**Outcomes**:

**If players win (very likely)**: The bandits are defeated, captured, or fled. Corvin is rescued.

**If players struggle**: Corvin could break free and help, or a patrol from Oakridge Camp arrives to assist (introduce 2 friendly NPCs with basic stats).

**If players lose (unlikely)**: The bandits take the PCs' valuables and flee, leaving the PCs and Corvin tied up. They escape after the bandits leave, but lose money/time. This is a setback, not a campaign-ender.

**After Combat**:

Corvin is grateful, shaken but unharmed. He thanks the PCs profusely and confirms he'll pay the full fee once back in Millhaven.

**Loot** (if players search the bandit camp):
- 30 silver coins (stolen from Corvin)
- Basic camping gear
- A crude map showing other bandit camps in the region (potential future adventure hook)
- Torvin's club (heavy, usable as weapon)

**Choices**:
- Do players take the bandits prisoner, leave them tied up, or let them flee?
- Do they escort Corvin directly back to Millhaven, or continue to Oakridge Camp first?

---

### Scene 4: Resolution and Next Steps

**Purpose**: Wrap up the adventure and set up future sessions.

**Back in Millhaven**:

Corvin and Elara pay the promised fee (50 silver coins total, split among PCs). Corvin offers an additional 20 silver if players return the stolen money, bringing the total to 70 silver.

**Elara mentions**: "Corvin said the bandits were asking about 'the shipment from Greywater.' They seemed to know he'd be on that road. Someone might have tipped them off."

**Possible Follow-Up Hooks**:
1. Investigate who told the bandits about Corvin's route
2. Clear out other bandit camps using the map found in Scene 3
3. Escort Corvin's trade shipment to Greywater (the original job)
4. Explore why Corvin mentioned "strange sounds in the forest" to Elara

**GM Guidance**: Ask players which direction they want to explore. Use their answer to plan the next session.

---

### GM Tips for Running This Adventure

**Pacing**: Each scene should take 20-40 minutes. If a scene drags, move to the next one. If players rush, let them—don't force every scene to last a certain length.

**Difficulty**: This adventure uses DC 12-14 for most Checks. Only use DC 16 for especially tough moments (like convincing the bandit leader to back down without a fight).

**Player Freedom**: If players come up with creative solutions you didn't expect, go with it. The goal is a good story, not following the script exactly.

**Combat Balance**: Three bandits vs three PCs is roughly balanced, but players should win. If combat seems too easy, have bandits act smarter. If too hard, have an injured bandit flee early or reduce their Resolve Clocks.

**When Players Get Stuck**: Drop hints. Have an NPC offer suggestions, or let players roll RSN Checks to remember obvious clues.

**Roleplaying NPCs**: Elara is worried and scattered. Torvin is a cowardly bully. Corvin is grateful and nervous. You don't need elaborate voices—just describe their tone and body language.

**"What If Players Do X?"**:

**What if players ignore the quest and do something else?**
- Let them! Improvise a new adventure. Or have Elara increase the offered reward to make the quest more tempting.

**What if players try to ambush the bandits with elaborate traps?**
- Great! Let them describe their plan. Call for RSN Checks (DC 12-14) to set traps successfully. Grant Edge on the first round of combat if traps work.

**What if players want to intimidate the bandits into surrendering without a fight?**
- Excellent! Call for a DC 16 PRE Check (Intimidation or Persuasion). Success means Torvin backs down and releases Corvin for a smaller payment. The Tank (Garrick) is perfect for this approach.

**What if players attack Corvin by mistake or betray him?**
- Razorweave supports many play styles. If players genuinely want to play as criminals, let them. Elara becomes an enemy, town guards get involved, and the campaign shifts to an outlaw story. Ask players if this is really the direction they want—it's a major tone shift.

**What if players want to recruit the bandits?**
- Torvin is a coward but might agree if paid. Kess and Rol just want steady work. This could lead to interesting complications (Can they be trusted? What does Elara think?).

**What if combat goes badly and a PC's Resolve Clock fills?**
- They're knocked unconscious or forced to retreat. Another PC can stabilize them with a DC 12 RSN Check (First Aid or Medicine) after combat. They wake up groggy but alive after a few minutes.

**What if players split the party?**
- Let them! Handle each group's actions in turn. If one group triggers combat, resolve that fully before cutting back to the other group.

## What's Next?

Congratulations—you've played Razorweave! Here's what to explore next:

### Continue Playing
You don't need to read the entire rulebook before your next session. You've learned the essentials. Keep playing and reference rules as needed.

### Explore the Full Rules
When you're ready for more depth:
- **Chapter 6 (Character Creation)**: Learn to create your own characters from scratch
- **Chapter 8 (Actions, Checks, and Outcomes)**: Detailed explanation of the Check system with many examples
- **Chapter 10 (Combat Basics)**: Expanded combat rules, advanced actions, and tactical options
- **Chapters 21-26 (GM Guidance)**: Tools for creating your own adventures, NPCs, and worlds

### Build Your Own Characters
The pre-generated characters are great for learning, but creating your own is more rewarding. Use the **15-Minute Character Creation** process in Chapter 6:
1. Pick a concept (one sentence)
2. Assign Attributes (2, 1, 1, 0)
3. Choose 3-4 Skills
4. Choose 2-3 Proficiencies
5. Pick starting gear
6. Define one connection to another character or the world

### Create Your Own Adventures
The "Missing Merchant" structure works for many scenarios:
1. **Setup**: Someone needs help (or players pursue a goal)
2. **Investigation**: Gather information through social interaction
3. **Exploration**: Travel to a location, track clues, face environmental challenges
4. **Confrontation**: Resolve the situation through combat, negotiation, or clever thinking
5. **Resolution**: Wrap up, pay rewards, introduce next adventure hook

Change the details, and you have a new adventure: missing child instead of merchant, haunted ruin instead of bandit camp, rival merchant instead of bandits, etc.
