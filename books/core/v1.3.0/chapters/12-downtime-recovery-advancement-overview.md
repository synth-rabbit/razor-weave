## 12. Downtime, Recovery, and Advancement Overview

Downtime and advancement connect sessions together. They answer two questions: what happens to characters
        between high‑pressure scenes, and how do they grow over time. This chapter provides an overview of
        recovery, downtime activities, and progression models. Later chapters and references expand each area in
        more detail.

### Downtime Overview

Downtime represents the hours, days, or weeks when characters are not in immediate danger. It is a space
        for rest, training, projects, and relationships. Good downtime:

- Lets characters recover from consequences and Conditions.
- Creates room for personal goals beyond the main plot.
- Seeds future adventures through projects and connections.

The GM and players decide how much in‑world time passes. A short downtime might cover a night between
        missions; a long one might span a season.

### Recovery and Rest

Rest is the foundation of recovery:

- **Short rest**– A few hours to catch breath, bind wounds, and clear minor Conditions.
- **Long rest**– A full night or more to reset after major exertion.
- **Extended downtime**– Days or weeks that allow deep recovery, training, and projects.

Many Conditions clear automatically with appropriate rest:*Exhausted*fades after sleep,*Bleeding*resolves after treatment and time, minor*Frightened*states ease once the threat
        passes. More serious Conditions—*Poisoned*,*Cursed*, or long‑term injuries—may require
        specialized care, quests, or narrative solutions.

### Downtime Activities

Beyond simple rest, characters can dedicate downtime to structured activities. Common examples include:

- **Training**– Practicing with mentors, refining Skills, or conditioning Attributes.
- **Research**– Studying lore, tracking rumors, or analyzing data.
- **Crafting**– Building or modifying gear, tools, or infrastructure.
- **Relationships**– Strengthening bonds with NPCs, factions, or communities.
- **Projects**– Pursuing long‑term goals like founding a safehouse or establishing a
          network.

Each activity usually:

- Consumes a defined unit of downtime (a day, a week, a season).
- May involve one or more Checks, often against a progress Clock.
- Produces concrete outcomes: Skills gained, information uncovered, allies won, or structures built.

> **Example**
> **Example – Training as a Clock**
A character seeks to learn a new Blades Skill from a retired duelist. The GM creates a 6‑segment “Train
>         with Master Valen” Clock. Each week of focused training, the player rolls AGI or RSN against a moderate
>         DC. Full successes tick 2 segments, partials tick 1. When the Clock fills, they gain the Skill and a new
>         relationship with Valen as an ongoing contact.

### Long‑Term Projects

Some goals are too large for a single downtime period. Long‑term projects use bigger Clocks and are often
        tied directly to campaign arcs. Examples:

- Establishing a spy network in a city.
- Building or upgrading a stronghold.
- Rehabilitating a neighborhood or recovering from a disaster.
- Reconciling or reshaping relationships between factions.

For each project, work with the GM to:

- Define the end state (what “complete” looks like).
- Set a progress Clock sized to the goal.
- Identify key milestones or phases.

Progress can come from downtime, on‑screen adventures, or both. Setbacks may create separate “Complication”
        Clocks that, if filled, delay or transform the project. Treat these as story opportunities rather than
        punishment.

### Relationships, Factions, and Standing

Downtime is also when you invest in people. Characters can nurture friendships, manage obligations, and
        shift their standing with factions. Many groups find it helpful to track faction standing on a simple
        ladder:

- **Hostile**– actively opposed, may move against you.
- **Unfriendly**– suspicious, minimal cooperation, inflated prices.
- **Neutral**– transactional; standard treatment.
- **Friendly**– helpful; discounts, information, and small favors.
- **Honored**– invested in your success; serious support and protection.

Significant actions—rescuing allies, defending territory, forwarding or opposing a faction’s goals—move
        standing up or down. Neglect can also matter; if you ignore an important relationship for a long time,
        the GM may introduce a Clock that tracks fading trust until you reconnect.

### Advancement Overview

Advancement represents mechanical growth: new Skills, expanded Proficiencies, and occasional Attribute
        improvements. It should also reflect narrative change: what your character has learned, how they have
        changed, and which arcs have moved forward.

There are three common progression models. Your table can use one or blend them:

- **XP‑based advancement**– You earn experience points for overcoming challenges and
          achieving goals, then spend XP on Skills, Proficiencies, or Attributes.
- **Milestone‑based advancement**– You advance when you reach narrative milestones, such
          as completing arcs or defeating major threats.
- **Session‑based advancement**– You advance after a set number of sessions, regardless of
          specific story beats.

Chapter 19, “Advancement and Long Term Growth,” provides detailed guidance, including costs, pacing, and
        genre‑specific advice. This chapter focuses on how advancement feels and how it connects to downtime.

### Narrative Arcs and Growth

Progression is most satisfying when mechanical changes follow narrative arcs. When you advance, ask:

- What has my character learned or survived recently?
- How have their beliefs, relationships, or goals shifted?
- Which new capabilities reflect that change?

Tie new Skills, Proficiencies, or Attribute bumps to concrete experiences in play: training scenes,
        pivotal choices, or climactic confrontations. This keeps growth feeling earned and grounded.

> **Example**
> **Example – Advancement Tied to Arc**
After exposing a corrupt official and choosing to protect whistleblowers instead of seeking revenge, a
>         character gains a social Proficiency focused on coordination and advocacy and a new investigative Skill.
>         These advancements reflect their shift from lone operator to community organizer, making future scenes
>         about those themes richer.

### Connecting Advancement to Downtime

Downtime activities and advancement reinforce each other:

- Training and projects can justify or accelerate new Skills and Proficiencies.
- Research and relationships can unlock opportunities that become advancement milestones.
- Long‑term projects can culminate in major advancement events (new Attributes, expanded domains).

When the table discusses advancement, consider what downtime scenes you want to play to show that growth.
        Likewise, when you plan downtime, think about which kinds of growth you hope it will make possible.

### Table Practices for Downtime and Advancement

A few simple practices keep downtime and advancement smooth:

- Talk about goals openly—what each player wants for their character between arcs.
- Choose a progression model together and revisit it if the pacing feels off.
- Use Clocks to track projects and relationships you care about, not every minor task.
- Let advancement decisions wait until you see how a story beat lands; pick changes that fit the outcome.

Downtime, recovery, and advancement are where the campaign breathes. Use them to give characters room to
        change, deepen ties to the world, and set up the next set of hard choices.
