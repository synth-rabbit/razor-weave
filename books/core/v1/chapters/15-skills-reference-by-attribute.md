## 15. Skills Reference

This chapter offers example Skills grouped by Attribute. It is not an exhaustive catalog. Instead, it
        shows the kinds of capabilities that naturally lean on Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Presence (PRE), and
        Reason (RSN), with short descriptions and sample uses. After each group, a few Skills are expanded into
        detailed entries that follow the structure described in the previous chapter.

### Might (MIG) Skills

Might‑leaning Skills focus on strength, endurance, and direct physical effort. They often appear when you
        push, lift, resist, or endure things that would overwhelm most people. MIG Skills are not just about
        violence—they also cover hard labor, rescue work, and physically demanding crafts.

Example MIG‑Facing Skills****************

| Skill                    | What It Represents                                                        | Sample Uses                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Athletic Movement        | Running, jumping, climbing, and other full‑body movements under pressure. | Chasing a fleeing suspect across rooftops; hauling yourself and a companion up a crumbling ledge; forcing your way through a crowded platform before the train departs. |
| Heavy Lifting & Carrying | Moving and stabilizing heavy loads without specialized equipment.         | Shifting a fallen beam to free a trapped worker; carrying an injured ally out of a collapsing tunnel; loading crates quickly before a storm hits.                       |
| Grit & Endurance         | Withstanding fatigue, harsh environments, and prolonged exertion.         | Marching through a heatwave without proper shade; rowing against the current for hours; staying on your feet during a long night watch after earlier exertions.         |
| Close‑Quarters Struggle  | Grappling, holding, and breaking free at arm’s reach.                     | Wrestling a saboteur away from a control panel; restraining a panicked passenger without hurting them; fighting to keep a door closed against a crowd.                  |

#### Athletic Movement — Exploration / Conflict (MIG)

**Description:**Athletic Movement covers running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and other full‑body movement under pressure. Characters with this Skill know how to conserve momentum, balance speed and safety, and read terrain for opportunities.

**Default actions:**Climbing rough surfaces, crossing gaps, sprinting through unstable ground, or swimming against a current. Routine efforts in good conditions might be DC 12–14; risky leaps in bad weather or climbs while encumbered may push DCs into the 16–20 range.

**Synergies and counters:**Tags like*Cramped*or*Unstable*make movement riskier, while secure anchor points or safety gear can justify Advantage. Conditions such as*Exhausted*or*Injured*often impose Disadvantage or raise effective DCs.

**GM usage notes:**Use this Skill when movement itself is the source of tension. Partial successes are good places to introduce new Tags or tick environmental Clocks—reaching the ledge but dislodging debris, for example.

> **Example**
> **Example – Athletic Movement**
The group needs to cross between two rooftops before a patrol arrives. The gap is wide, the night is rainy, and the Tag*Slick*is in play. The GM calls for a MIG + Athletic Movement Check at DC 16. On a Full Success, the character clears the gap cleanly. On a Partial Success, they make it but knock tiles loose, adding*Unstable*to the landing roof and ticking a “Guards Alerted” Clock by one.

#### Heavy Lifting & Carrying — Exploration / Support (MIG)

**Description:**Heavy Lifting & Carrying represents moving, bracing, and stabilizing heavy loads without specialized machinery. Characters with this Skill know how to use leverage, footing, and teamwork to keep weight under control.

**Default actions:**Shifting debris, hauling injured allies, or relocating bulky equipment. Clearing a simple blockage with time and help might sit at DC 12–14; lifting or holding something that is actively collapsing, burning, or unstable often reaches DC 16–20.

**Synergies and counters:**Tags like*Solid Cover*,*Stable*surfaces, or access to proper tools can justify Advantage or lower DCs.*Unstable*,*Hazardous*, or*Cramped*spaces increase risk and may impose Disadvantage, especially if characters are also*Exhausted*or*Injured*.

**GM usage notes:**Treat Heavy Lifting as a chance to spotlight physical heroism and teamwork. On a Partial Success, consider progress with escalating danger—weight shifts, Clocks tick on structural collapse, or someone takes a Condition in exchange for getting others clear.

> **Example**
> **Example – Heavy Lifting & Carrying**
A maintenance platform buckles, pinning a worker beneath a support beam. The area is tagged*Hazardous*and*Unstable*. The GM calls for a MIG + Heavy Lifting Check at DC 18. A Full Success means the beam is raised long enough for the worker to scramble free, and the group retreats before the platform fails. On a Partial Success, the worker is saved but one PC gains the*Exhausted*Condition as the beam crashes down behind them.

#### Grit & Endurance — Survival (MIG)

**Description:**Grit & Endurance measures how long your character can keep going under strain—physical, environmental, or emotional. It covers marathon efforts, holding a position under fire, and pushing through pain when others would stop.

**Default actions:**Marching long distances, rowing for hours, or holding a barricade against repeated assaults. Routine but taxing efforts might be DC 12–14; extreme situations—days without proper sleep, brutal weather, or a siege—can push DCs to 18–22 and may call for repeated Checks over time.

**Synergies and counters:**Access to rest, food, medical care, or supportive Tags like*Sheltered*lower DCs or justify Advantage. Stacking Conditions such as*Exhausted*,*Bleeding*, or*Frightened*makes continued effort much harder, often increasing DCs or turning Partial Successes into new Complications.

**GM usage notes:**Use Grit & Endurance Checks to mark the passage of grueling time. On Partial Success, let progress continue but introduce new Conditions or tick Clocks that reflect mounting strain, rather than simply ending the attempt.

> **Example**
> **Example – Grit & Endurance**
The party must hike through a wind‑scoured pass overnight to warn a nearby town. The GM sets a “Reach the Town Before Dawn” Clock and calls for a MIG + Grit & Endurance Check at DC 14. On a Full Success, the group advances the Clock and arrives tired but ready. On a Partial, they still advance the Clock but one PC gains*Exhausted*, and another suffers*Frostbitten*fingers as an ad‑hoc Condition that will matter in later scenes.

#### Close‑Quarters Struggle — Conflict (MIG)

**Description:**Close‑Quarters Struggle covers grappling, shoving, restraining, and breaking free at arm’s reach. It is less about elegant martial arts and more about leverage, balance, and raw determination when the distance between combatants collapses.

**Default actions:**Holding someone back, escaping a grab, or wrestling over a weapon. Routine scuffles against untrained opponents might sit at DC 12–14; trying to restrain a prepared foe or overpower a larger opponent, especially in*Cramped*or*Crowded*conditions, can push DCs to 16–20.

**Synergies and counters:**Tags like*Crowded*or*Confined*may help a grappler who can pin foes against surfaces, while*Hazardous*terrain makes failed Checks more dangerous. Conditions such as*Restrained*or*Exposed*shape follow‑up actions, often granting Advantage to allies or to the opponent.

**GM usage notes:**Grapples are great moments to bring Tags and Conditions into focus. On Partial Success, trade control back and forth—perhaps the PC restrains their foe but ends up positioned dangerously close to an edge or hazard.

> **Example**
> **Example – Close‑Quarters Struggle**
In a maintenance corridor tagged*Cramped*, a saboteur lunges for the emergency release. A PC tackles them, triggering a MIG + Close‑Quarters Struggle Check at DC 15. A Full Success pins the saboteur, applying the*Restrained*Condition. A Partial Success stops the release but leaves both characters struggling, and the GM adds an*Exposed*Tag as security cameras pivot toward the scuffle.

### Agility (AGI) Skills

Agility‑leaning Skills emphasize precision, balance, reflexes, and fine control. They cover stealthy
        movement, delicate manipulation, and actions where timing and positioning matter more than raw power. AGI
        Skills often determine who moves first, who avoids danger, and who can operate safely in constrained or
        unstable environments.

Example AGI‑Facing Skills****************

| Skill                 | What It Represents                                                 | Sample Uses                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stealth & Evasion     | Moving quietly, staying out of sight, and slipping past attention. | Crossing a dim relay hall while guards converse nearby; disappearing into a festival crowd when spotted; circling around to flank an enemy without drawing fire. |
| Fine Manipulation     | Delicate handwork under pressure—lockpicking, tools, instruments.  | Bypassing a mechanical lock in a cramped stairwell; patching a cable while the platform shakes; quickly reconfiguring a delicate device during a scene.          |
| Acrobatic Positioning | Balancing, tumbling, and using the environment to your advantage.  | Leaping from balcony to balcony in a theater; sliding under a closing gate; navigating a derailed carriage without falling through gaps.                         |
| Ranged Technique      | Accurate attacks or precise throws with ranged tools.              | Taking a careful shot from an elevated walkway; tossing a grappling line to a rooftop; hurling a lantern to shatter at just the right spot.                      |

#### Stealth & Evasion — Exploration / Conflict (AGI)

**Description:**Stealth & Evasion is the ability to move quietly, stay out of sight, and slip through gaps in attention. It includes reading patrol patterns, choosing routes, and using cover effectively.

**Default actions:**Crossing guarded spaces without being seen, hiding in cluttered environments, shadowing someone through a crowd, or breaking line of sight. DCs depend on alertness and environment: DC 12–14 for casual observation, 16–18 against active patrols or*Alert*Tags.

**Synergies and counters:**Tags like*Dim Light*,*Crowded*, or*Obscured*often support this Skill, granting Advantage or lowering effective DCs.*Alert*,*Surveillance*, or noisy gear can impose Disadvantage or raise DCs.

**GM usage notes:**When a Stealth Check fails, think about how the story changes—guards might become suspicious rather than immediately sounding alarms, or a partial reveal might create a tense chase instead of a static fight.

> **Example**
> **Example – Stealth & Evasion**
A character tries to slip past a checkpoint in a foggy yard at night. The Tags*Dim Light*and*Obscured*are present, but the guards are on*Alert*. The GM calls for an AGI + Stealth &
>         Evasion Check at DC 16, ruling that the helpful Tags and the*Alert*state balance out. On a Full
>         Success, the character passes unseen. On a Partial, they get through but one guard notices footprints in
>         the mud, ticking a “Suspicion Rising” Clock.

#### Fine Manipulation — Technical (AGI)

**Description:**Fine Manipulation covers delicate handwork under pressure—picking locks, handling fragile instruments, and making precise adjustments in tight spaces. Characters with this Skill know how much force is safe, when to pause, and how to adapt when conditions change.

**Default actions:**Bypassing simple locks, repairing small mechanisms, or re‑routing cables in confined housings. Straightforward tasks with time and tools may be DC 12–14; rushed repairs in*Hazardous*or*Slick*environments, or on unfamiliar devices, can reach DC 18–20.

**Synergies and counters:**Good light, proper tools, and helpful Tags like*Stable*or*Secure*justify Advantage or lower DCs. Poor lighting, vibrations, alarms counting down, or the*Cramped*Tag make success harder and elevate the consequences of failure.

**GM usage notes:**Use Fine Manipulation Checks when the details of a mechanism matter. On Partial Success, let the device function but introduce a side effect—extra noise, temporary instability, or a Clock that tracks hidden wear that will matter later.

> **Example**
> **Example – Fine Manipulation**
A character hangs from a swaying catwalk, trying to reseat a relay plug before a safety Clock fills. The scene is tagged*Unstable*and*Hazardous*. The GM calls for an AGI + Fine Manipulation Check at DC 17. On a Full Success, the relay snaps into place and the alarms quiet. On a Partial, the relay works—but a shower of sparks ticks a “Fire in the Conduit” Clock by one.

#### Acrobatic Positioning — Exploration / Conflict (AGI)

**Description:**Acrobatic Positioning represents tumbling, vaulting, and using the environment to gain favorable positions. It is about turning ladders, ledges, and furniture into a playground that keeps you one step ahead of danger.

**Default actions:**Sliding under closing doors, flipping over cover, or bouncing between balconies. Simple stunts with clear footing might be DC 12–14; long gaps, collapsing scenery, or zero‑G environments can push DCs to 18–22.

**Synergies and counters:**Tags like*Elevated*,*Crowded*, or*Solid Cover*can become assets if the character has room to maneuver.*Cramped*,*Slick*, or*Unstable*spaces make missteps more punishing and may turn failures into Falls or new Conditions.

**GM usage notes:**Use Acrobatic Positioning to reward creative descriptions of movement. On Partial Success, let the character gain position but at a cost—perhaps taking on the*Exposed*Condition, or ticking a Clock that tracks environmental collapse.

> **Example**
> **Example – Acrobatic Positioning**
During a market‑square clash, a character uses stalls and awnings as improvised platforms. The GM calls for an AGI + Acrobatic Positioning Check at DC 15 to reach a hanging sign that provides*Elevated*firing position. A Full Success puts them safely atop the sign. On a Partial, they make it—but the sign’s supports strain, adding the*Unstable*Tag to their perch.

#### Ranged Technique — Conflict (AGI)

**Description:**Ranged Technique is the practiced ability to place shots, throws, or other ranged effects exactly where they need to go. It covers judging distance, leading targets, and compensating for wind, recoil, or unusual angles.

**Default actions:**Taking aimed shots, lobbing grenades or alchemical vials, or tossing grappling hooks. Routine shots at known ranges might be DC 12–14; difficult shots through*Obscured*areas, at long range, or while threatened often land around DC 16–20.

**Synergies and counters:**Tags like*Elevated*,*Stable*footing, or prepared sights can grant Advantage.*Obscured*environments,*Slick*footing, or Conditions like*Shaken*or*Dazed*impose Disadvantage or raise DCs.

**GM usage notes:**Ranged Technique Checks are opportunities to show how the environment shapes combat. On Partial Success, consider outcomes like grazing hits that apply a Condition, or successful shots that also damage cover, adding new Tags to the battlefield.

> **Example**
> **Example – Ranged Technique**
A character on a rooftop tagged*Elevated*tries to shoot out a cable anchoring a runaway tram before it derails. The GM calls for an AGI + Ranged Technique Check at DC 18, factoring in the tram’s speed and the stress of the moment. On a Full Success, the cable snaps cleanly and the tram grinds to a controlled halt. On a Partial, the cable is severed but the tram slams into a buffer, ticking a “Injured Passengers” Clock.

### Presence (PRE) Skills

Presence‑leaning Skills are about influence, emotional resonance, and social navigation. They come to the
        forefront when your character speaks, negotiates, performs, or stands firm under social pressure. PRE
        Skills shape how NPCs and factions feel about you and how scenes change when you step in.

Example PRE‑Facing Skills****************

| Skill                   | What It Represents                                                   | Sample Uses                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Persuasion & Appeal     | Convincing others through argument, empathy, or shared interest.     | Talking a station chief into delaying a dangerous launch; persuading a frightened neighbor to share what they saw; calming a restless crowd before panic spreads. |
| Command & Coordination  | Directing allies, issuing orders, and aligning efforts under stress. | Coordinating a multi‑step evacuation; calling out tactics in a tense standoff; rallying scattered workers to resist a threat together.                            |
| Deception & Performance | Presenting a convincing façade, playing roles, or masking intent.    | Passing as an official inspector; staging a minor argument as a distraction; delivering a stirring speech that hides a coded message.                             |
| Insight & Empathy       | Reading people’s moods, motivations, and tells.                      | Noticing when a witness is omitting something; sensing that a faction leader is more afraid than angry; spotting who in a crowd is truly listening.               |

#### Persuasion & Appeal — Social (PRE)

**Description:**Persuasion & Appeal is the ability to convince others through argument, empathy, or shared interest. It helps you change minds or soften positions without deception.

**Default actions:**Negotiating terms, calming frightened NPCs, or advocating for a course of action. Everyday requests might sit at DC 12–14; high‑stakes persuasion against resistant targets can reach DC 18–20.

**Synergies and counters:**Positive standing with a faction, prior favors, or supportive Tags (such as*Friendly*atmosphere) can justify Advantage or lower DCs. Deep grudges, conflicting goals, or a*Tense*Tag make success harder.

**GM usage notes:**Use outcome tiers to adjust both content and tone of NPC responses. Partial successes might grant what the PCs want at a cost, such as obligations or strings attached.

> **Example**
> **Example – Persuasion & Appeal**
The characters ask a guild leader to delay a crucial shipment. The guild’s standing with them is*Neutral*, but they recently helped with a separate problem. The GM calls for a PRE + Persuasion
>         Check at DC 16, noting that success means the delay is granted, while a Partial success means the delay
>         comes with a promised favor the guild will collect later.

#### Command & Coordination — Social / Support (PRE)

**Description:**Command & Coordination is the ability to direct allies under pressure, align efforts, and keep a group focused on a shared goal. It is as much about clear communication and trust as it is about barking orders.

**Default actions:**Organizing evacuations, coordinating tactics, or assigning roles during tense operations. Simple direction among willing allies might be DC 12–14; trying to coordinate panicked crowds or fractious factions can reach DC 18–20, especially when time is short.

**Synergies and counters:**Existing trust, clear plans, and stabilizing Tags such as*Organized*or*Prepared*can reduce DCs or justify Advantage. Chaos, misinformation, or hostile Tags like*Panicked*or*Hostile Crowd*make success harder and magnify the cost of failure.

**GM usage notes:**Use Command & Coordination Checks to decide how effectively groups move or act as a unit. On Partial Success, allow progress but with frayed edges—delays, miscommunications, or pockets of resistance that become hooks for future scenes.

> **Example**
> **Example – Command & Coordination**
A fire breaks out in a crowded depot. The GM tags the scene*Panic Rising*and calls for a PRE + Command & Coordination Check at DC 15 as a PC tries to organize an orderly evacuation. A Full Success clears the station in time, stabilizing the situation. A Partial succeeds but leaves a side entrance jammed, ticking a “Trapped Workers” Clock the group must address later.

#### Deception & Performance — Social (PRE)

**Description:**Deception & Performance covers acting, misdirection, and presenting convincing façades. Characters with this Skill can lie smoothly, play roles, or put on shows that direct attention where they want it.

**Default actions:**Passing as someone else, staging distractions, or concealing true intentions in conversation. Simple lies with low stakes might be DC 12–14; intricate impersonations, long‑term cons, or bold public performances under scrutiny can hit DC 18–22.

**Synergies and counters:**Props, disguises, and supportive Tags like*Crowded*or*Festive*justify Advantage. Informed audiences, existing suspicions, or Tags such as*Alert*and*Tense*push DCs higher, especially if the PCs are already*Marked*or*Exposed*.

**GM usage notes:**Deception Checks are a great place to lean on outcome tiers. Partial Success might buy time or partial belief while seeding later complications—NPCs who are unconvinced but play along, or an audience that enjoys the show but asks probing questions afterward.

> **Example**
> **Example – Deception & Performance**
To infiltrate a private gala, a PC poses as a visiting dignitary. The GM notes the Tags*Formal*and*Alert Security*and calls for a PRE + Deception & Performance Check at DC 17. On a Full Success, the character passes inspection and gains access to the inner balcony. On a Partial, they are waved through but one guard quietly notes oddities in their story, ticking a “Security Suspicion” Clock.

#### Insight & Empathy — Social (PRE)

**Description:**Insight & Empathy is the ability to read moods, notice unspoken tensions, and respond in ways that build connection. It helps you understand what people need or fear, even when they are not saying it directly.

**Default actions:**Sensing when someone is lying by omission, recognizing when a negotiation is about pride instead of price, or spotting who in a group is closest to changing their mind. Everyday reads of open conversations may be DC 12–14; subtle deception, masked emotions, or cross‑cultural misunderstandings can push DCs toward 18–20.

**Synergies and counters:**Time spent listening, shared experiences, and quiet spaces can justify Advantage. Distracting environments,*Tense*or*Hostile*Tags, or your own Conditions like*Frightened*or*Suppressed*make it harder to read others clearly.

**GM usage notes:**Insight Checks are ideal for revealing partial truths. On Partial Success, share honest but incomplete information or let the PC sense there is more beneath the surface, prompting further investigation or conversation.

> **Example**
> **Example – Insight & Empathy**
While negotiating with a faction envoy, a PC quietly watches body language instead of speaking much. The GM calls for a PRE + Insight & Empathy Check at DC 14. On a Full Success, the PC realizes the envoy is more afraid of their own superiors than of the PCs, revealing a pressure point. On a Partial, they sense fear but misread its source, pointing suspicion at the wrong faction and seeding future complications.

### Reason (RSN) Skills

Reason‑leaning Skills focus on analysis, memory, perception, and structured thinking. They shine when you
        sift clues, diagnose problems, plan ahead, or notice what others overlook. RSN Skills often drive
        investigation, engineering tasks, and long‑term strategies.

Example RSN‑Facing Skills****************

| Skill                  | What It Represents                                                                | Sample Uses                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Perception & Awareness | Noticing details, patterns, and subtle changes in the environment.                | Spotting a disturbed patch of dust near a hidden panel; hearing the telltale click of a misaligned relay; realizing a crowd’s mood is shifting before anyone speaks.   |
| Investigation          | Following leads, connecting evidence, and reconstructing events.                  | Piecing together a sabotage timeline from logs; reconstructing a confrontation from scattered signs; determining which of several suspects had the opportunity to act. |
| Systems & Diagnostics  | Understanding and troubleshooting complex systems—mechanical, social, or digital. | Tracing a glitch in a relay network; modeling how a faction will react to a policy change; identifying weak points in a fortress layout.                               |
| Lore & Analysis        | Recalling knowledge, interpreting texts, and applying theory.                     | Identifying a symbol from an old campaign; interpreting the implications of a new law; recognizing that a pattern in strange messages matches an old cipher style.     |

#### Investigation — Exploration (RSN)

**Description:**Investigation covers following leads, connecting evidence, and reconstructing events. Where Perception tells you what is present, Investigation helps you determine why and how.

**Default actions:**Analyzing a crime scene, comparing records for inconsistencies, or tracing the path of a missing person. Straightforward inquiries might be DC 12–14; complex puzzles or well‑hidden schemes push toward DC 18–22.

**Synergies and counters:**Access to records, helpful NPCs, or prior research can lower DCs or justify Advantage. Tags such as*Obscured*,*Hazardous*locations, or active Cover‑Up Clocks raise stakes and complicate interpretation.

**GM usage notes:**Treat Investigation Checks as steps in a process, not single all‑or‑nothing gates. Use Clocks to track progress toward understanding, and let partial results reveal some truths while leaving room for future discoveries—or mistakes.

> **Example**
> **Example – Investigation**
The group examines a sabotaged relay hub. The GM sets a 6‑segment “Understand the Sabotage” Clock and
>         calls for an RSN + Investigation Check at DC 14. A Full Success both advances the Clock and clearly links
>         the damage to a particular toolset. A Partial advances the Clock but hints at two possible culprits,
>         leaving ambiguity the group will need to resolve later.

#### Perception & Awareness — Exploration (RSN)

**Description:**Perception & Awareness represents noticing details, patterns, and subtle changes in your surroundings. It includes listening for unusual sounds, spotting movement at the edge of vision, and recognizing when something feels “off.”

**Default actions:**Hearing approaching footsteps, spotting hidden compartments, or noticing tampered equipment. Routine observations in quiet spaces might be DC 12–14; catching faint clues in*Obscured*or*Crowded*environments, or under time pressure, often climbs to DC 16–20.

**Synergies and counters:**Tags such as*Elevated*,*Well‑Lit*, or*Quiet*justify lower DCs or Advantage.*Dim Light*,*Obscured*,*Noisy*, or Conditions like*Dazed*or*Distracted*raise DCs and make Partial Success more likely.

**GM usage notes:**Use Perception Checks to highlight how the world communicates with the PCs. On Partial Success, share useful but incomplete information—enough to prompt action, but not enough to eliminate all uncertainty.

> **Example**
> **Example – Perception & Awareness**
The group passes through a cargo bay tagged*Crowded*and*Noisy*. The GM calls for an RSN + Perception & Awareness Check at DC 15 to notice signs of recent tampering. A Full Success spots tool marks near a concealed panel and a faint chemical smell. A Partial reveals only that crates near the panel have been rearranged, hinting that something is hidden but not exactly what.

#### Systems & Diagnostics — Technical (RSN)

**Description:**Systems & Diagnostics focuses on understanding and troubleshooting complex systems—mechanical, digital, magical, or social. It covers building mental models, tracing failure points, and predicting how changes will ripple through the whole.

**Default actions:**Tracing faults in relay networks, modeling faction responses, or identifying structural weak points. Simple troubles with clear symptoms might be DC 12–14; subtle glitches, layered conspiracies, or interlocking systems can push required DCs to 18–22 and may require multiple Checks over time.

**Synergies and counters:**Access to logs, schematics, or expert testimony lowers DCs or grants Advantage. Tags like*Obscured*records,*Corrupted*data, or active sabotage Clocks raise stakes and may turn failure into cascading consequences.

**GM usage notes:**Systems Checks are natural moments to use Clocks that track understanding or system stability. On Partial Success, let PCs isolate some but not all issues, or solve one problem while planting the seeds of the next.

> **Example**
> **Example – Systems & Diagnostics**
After repeated brownouts, a PC reviews the station’s power map. The GM requires an RSN + Systems & Diagnostics Check at DC 16. A Full Success identifies both the failing relay and a suspicious reroute that points toward sabotage. A Partial pinpoints the failing relay but misses the reroute, advancing a “Saboteur’s Plan” Clock off‑screen.

#### Lore & Analysis — Knowledge (RSN)

**Description:**Lore & Analysis is your ability to recall information, interpret texts, and draw conclusions from recorded knowledge. It covers everything from local history and legal codes to arcane theory or xenobiology, depending on your setting.

**Default actions:**Identifying symbols, recalling historical events, or interpreting research notes. Common references might be DC 12–14; obscure facts, deliberately hidden knowledge, or cross‑disciplinary questions can reach DC 18–22.

**Synergies and counters:**Access to archives, libraries, or mentors can lower DCs. Tags like*Restricted*or*Redacted*documents, or time pressure during research, raise difficulty and make Partial Success more attractive than outright failure.

**GM usage notes:**Use Lore & Analysis Checks to feed players actionable context rather than trivia. On Partial Success, reveal one clear fact alongside a misleading implication or missing piece, inviting follow‑up scenes to refine the truth.

> **Example**
> **Example – Lore & Analysis**
Investigating an old faction sigil, a PC consults scattered notes from the Mechanics Reference era. The GM calls for an RSN + Lore & Analysis Check at DC 15. A Full Success confirms the symbol belongs to an outlawed engineering guild and explains why their devices are so unstable. A Partial reveals the guild’s name and their reputation for dangerous experiments but omits that some of their techniques were quietly adopted by respectable institutions.

### Mixing Attributes and Skills

These examples show where Skills most often lean, but they are not rigid assignments. In play, you will
        often mix Attributes and Skills in flexible ways: a MIG‑focused character might pair Investigation with
        physical intimidation, while a PRE‑focused character might use Systems & Diagnostics to explain a
        problem convincingly to a nervous crowd. When in doubt, start from the fiction: what is your character
        doing, and which Attribute and Skill combination best captures that attempt.

### Case Studies: Flexible Skills

Many of the most memorable Skills are those that do not belong to a single Attribute. Instead, they
        describe broad approaches you can express in different ways. The Skill name stays the same, but the
        Attribute you pair it with shifts based on how you act in the scene. This keeps character concepts
        coherent across many situations without forcing you into the same kind of roll every time.

Here are a few example Skills that are intentionally flexible. Use them as inspiration when creating your
        own:

- **Streetwise**– Knowing where to go, who to talk to, and how to stay out of trouble in
          busy districts. You might roll 4d6 with PRE when buttering up a friendly barkeep, with RSN when
          piecing together rumors from scattered conversations, or with AGI when navigating rooftops and alleys
          to avoid patrol routes.
- **Field Medicine**– Stabilizing injuries with limited supplies. You might roll with MIG
          when physically hauling someone to safety while treating them, with RSN when diagnosing symptoms and
          choosing the right treatment, or with PRE when talking a frightened patient through a painful
          procedure.
- **Tinkering**– Improvising, repairing, and re‑purposing devices. You might roll with RSN
          when methodically dissecting how a gadget works, with AGI when re‑wiring a delicate mechanism in a
          cramped space, or with MIG when physically bending frames and panels back into shape so the internals
          can function.
- **Wayfinding**– Keeping your bearings over long journeys. You might roll with RSN when
          reading maps and stars, with MIG when pushing through harsh terrain and carrying gear, or with PRE when
          leading a group and keeping morale high through setbacks.

None of these Skills are “owned” by a single Attribute. During play, you describe what you do; the GM
        chooses an Attribute that matches that approach and checks whether your Skill helps. Over time, this makes
        Skills feel like parts of your character’s story, not just fixed mechanical packages.
