## 6. Character Creation

Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a
        concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that
        reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule
        before you start. This chapter guides you step by step and tells you when to reference later chapters
        for details.

### Learning by Example

Some players prefer to see a full character before reading detailed steps. If you want to follow a
        character build from start to finish, you can skip ahead to the example character later in this chapter
        and return to each step as needed.

### The Creation Flow

Character Creation follows a clear sequence. You begin with story driven questions, then add mechanical
        structure, then return to fiction to finalize your concept. Each step builds on the previous one.

1. Step One: Choose a Concept
1. Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements
1. Step Three: Assign Attributes
1. Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies
1. Step Four: Choose Skills
1. Step Five: Choose Proficiencies
1. Step Six: Determine Starting Gear
1. Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships
1. Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads
1. Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit

### Step One: Choose a Concept

Every character begins with a concept. A concept is the short answer to the question, who is this
        person. It is the foundation for every choice you make later in the process. The concept does not depend
        on mechanics. It does not require a long backstory. It is a clean expression of identity, role, and
        theme.

Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for
        discovery. A concept like retired scout with a guilty conscience offers a clearer direction than simply
        fighter. The first concept suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world. The
        second is mostly a job title.

> **Example**
> **Example**A player chooses the concept former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message
>         patterns. This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours,
>         delicate tools, and unanswered questions.

Your concept should tell you what kind of scenes you want to be in, what skills you might have learned,
        and what challenges might matter to you. If you feel stuck, talk with the GM and the other players. The
        group can help you find a concept that fits the tone of the campaign.

### Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements

Identity elements are the personal details that give your character depth. They are the details that
        help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at
        once. The goal is to add enough information that the character feels real.

Useful identity elements include:

- Name and pronouns
- Origin or home environment
- Everyday role or profession before the story begins
- Notable habits and mannerisms
- First impressions and social style
- One or two key experiences that shaped them

These details are most helpful when they connect to your concept. If your concept involves quiet work
        and technical skill, identity elements that reflect that focus will make the character feel grounded.

> **Example**
> **Example**The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement
>         built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes
>         are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.

You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character.
        For now, capture the parts that feel most important.

### Step Three: Assign Attributes

Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character tends to
        approach challenges when there is no time to prepare a careful strategy. Attributes are not personality
        traits. They are expressions of how your character acts when the moment demands action.

The system uses four Attributes:

- **Might (MIG)**: Physical strength, force, and raw endurance.
- **Agility (AGI)**: Balance, coordination, stealth, and quick reaction.
- **Presence (PRE)**: Social force, confidence, emotional expression, and leadership.
- **Reason (RSN)**: Logic, analysis, memory, and structured thinking.

New characters begin with the following Attribute spread.

- One Attribute at 2
- Two Attributes at 1
- One Attribute at 0

No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability. Characters
        begin competent but not exceptional in every area. As the campaign progresses, advancement rules will
        allow Attributes to grow.

Assign these values based on your concept and identity elements. Ask yourself which Attribute your
        character relies on most often, which areas they find challenging, and which weaknesses might create
        interesting story moments.

> **Example**
> **Example**Rella is analytical and steady. Her player chooses Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0. This
>         emphasizes her careful thinking, modest coordination, quiet presence, and relative physical weakness.

### Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies

This system does not rely on a fixed or exhaustive list of Skills or Proficiencies. The rulebook
        provides examples and frameworks, but players are encouraged to work with their GM to define custom
        entries that reflect their character's experiences, training, and background.

Skills and Proficiencies serve different purposes.

- **Skills**are action based competencies. They are used directly in Checks when your character attempts something under pressure or uncertainty.
- **Proficiencies**are narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines that your character understands well and that shape how the GM interprets the fiction.

Open lists and collaboration allow the system to support many different genres and character concepts
        without requiring constant balance adjustments. Because the resolution system and advantage rules keep
        extremes in check, creative choices stay within a stable range.

The GM has final approval over the scope of any custom Skill or Proficiency. A good entry is grounded in
        the setting, clear in purpose, and neither so broad that it covers everything nor so narrow that it
        rarely matters.

### Step Four: Choose Skills

Skills represent learned abilities and practiced competencies. They describe what your character has
        done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. Skills connect directly to action. When your
        character makes a Check, a Skill often shapes their approach.

Skills answer the question, what have you practiced enough to apply under stress. They cover actions
        such as moving quietly, reading a room, patching an injury, climbing, or analyzing a pattern. Skills are
        usually written as verbs or verb like phrases.

During Character Creation, choose a small set of Skills that reflect your concept and background. These
        are the actions your character knows how to perform with some confidence. Later chapters describe
        Skills in more detail and provide example lists grouped by Attribute.

> **Example**
> **Example**Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses
>         the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions
>         she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels.

You do not need to optimize your Skills. The best choices are the ones that support the kinds of scenes
        you want to experience. If your group plans to focus on investigation, travel, or social tension, choose
        Skills that will shine in those situations.

### Step Five: Choose Proficiencies

Proficiencies represent narrower areas of expertise that influence how the GM interprets the fiction.
        They describe tools, technologies, environments, or disciplines that your character understands deeply.
        Proficiencies often do not require a roll at all. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is
        obvious, or how serious a risk feels.

Proficiencies answer the question, what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly. They
        often appear as nouns or domain labels, such as medical tools, survey equipment, or small boat
        navigation.

During Character Creation, choose a small number of Proficiencies that grow naturally out of your
        concept and background. Work with the GM to make sure each Proficiency has a clear scope and fits the
        setting.

> **Example**
> **Example**Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the
>         Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands
>         the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.

Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they influence difficulty, consequences, and
        access to information. A character with the correct Proficiency may identify a hazard more quickly,
        avoid an unnecessary roll, or reduce the severity of a complication.

### Step Six: Determine Starting Gear

Your character begins play with a small set of equipment that fits their background, reflects their
        concept, and supports the type of stories they are about to enter. Gear does not provide numerical
        bonuses. It provides narrative capability, fictional positioning, and a sense of grounded reality.

Starting gear should feel personal and practical. It represents what your character already knows how
        to use. It also helps the GM understand what kind of situations your character is prepared for.

#### Basic Gear Package

New characters begin with the following items:

- Clothing suited to their environment
- A backpack or satchel
- Basic travel supplies
- A personal item that holds meaning

These are the essentials that allow any character to operate in the world.

#### Concept Driven Gear

In addition to the basic gear, each character chooses up to three items that reflect their background or
        profession. These items help define who they were before the story begins. They also give the GM material
        to work with when shaping scenes.

Examples include:

- A well used toolkit
- A compact field journal
- A collection of reference notes
- A handmade navigation compass
- A signal mirror
- A small medical pouch
- A set of precision tools
- A reliable lantern
- A simple musical instrument
- A deck of analysis cards
- A set of rope and climbing spikes

These items should feel directly connected to your concept and identity.

> **Example**
> **Example**Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher
>         fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work.

#### Tools and Equipment as Fictional Authority

Gear provides fictional authority. If your character carries the right tools for a task, the GM may:

- Lower difficulty
- Remove uncertainty
- Change the stakes
- Provide clearer approaches

Gear does not guarantee success. It enables meaningful choices and supports your character’s expertise.

If the character does not have suitable gear, the GM might increase difficulty or introduce
        complications. Gear matters most when the environment or situation is demanding.

#### Weapons and Dangerous Tools

If the campaign tone allows for weapons or hazardous tools, characters may begin with one simple item
        that fits their concept. This might be:

- A pocket knife
- A small baton
- A bow with a few arrows
- A sturdy multi tool
- A simple sidearm, if the genre supports it

Weapons should be grounded in the fiction of your setting. They are not meant to be superior mechanical
        objects. They are narrative tools that help shape how your character approaches risk.

If your world does not include weapons or includes them only sparingly, this section may be reduced or
        removed based on GM preference.

#### Custom Gear

The player and GM may collaborate to create custom gear that supports the concept. The item should be:

- Clear in purpose
- Grounded in the setting
- Useful in scenes
- Not mechanically overwhelming

Good custom gear is memorable and unique without dominating the story.

### Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships

Every character comes from somewhere. They have lived a life before the story begins. They have
        connections, memories, challenges, and unfinished business. Establishing background and relationships
        gives the character emotional depth and provides the GM with narrative tools that will enrich scenes,
        challenges, and future arcs.

Background should answer simple questions about where you grew up, what kind of work you used to do,
        which pressures shaped you, and who influenced your habits. You do not need a long timeline. Focus on
        the few details that explain your current self.

> **Example**
> **Example**Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were
>         spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. The steady routine and quiet
>         tension of relay work shaped her temperament and made her comfortable with long stretches of focused
>         attention.

In addition to background, define one or two meaningful relationships. These might be mentors, rivals,
        family members, coworkers, or friends. The relationship does not need to be fully detailed. It only
        needs to be important enough that it might matter later.

> **Example**
> **Example**Rella names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing.
>         Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods. The disagreement left tension
>         that has never been resolved.

You do not need to define every relationship up front. Leave space for new connections to emerge in
        play. When a new NPC feels important, you can add them to your relationship list.

### Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads

Goals and drives explain why your character keeps moving. They are the internal pressures that shape
        choices and responses. A goal is something concrete your character wants to achieve. A drive is a deeper
        motivation or fear that pushes them.

Personal threads are unresolved elements in your character's life. They might be unanswered questions,
        unfulfilled promises, or lingering tensions. These threads give the GM material to weave into future
        scenes.

> **Example**
> **Example**Rella has a goal to decode an anomalous pattern she once intercepted and a drive to avoid causing harm
>         through her work. A personal thread involves the mysterious origin of the pattern and who might have
>         sent it.

Try to define at least one short-term goal, one long-term goal, and one or two personal threads. You can
        always revise these as the story unfolds.

### Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit

Once you have completed the previous steps, review your character as a whole. Ask whether the concept,
        identity elements, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, goals, and
        threads feel like parts of the same person.

Talk with the GM and other players about how your character fits into the campaign. Look for natural
        connections, shared history, or complementary goals. Adjust details where needed so that the group feels
        like a cohesive cast.

### Example Character Build: Rella

This section presents Rella as a complete example character, summarizing the choices made in each step.
        Use this example as a reference when creating your own characters.

### Chapter Summary

Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the
        campaign. By moving from concept to identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background,
        relationships, and goals, you build a character who feels grounded and ready for play. Later chapters
        explain how these elements interact with the core mechanics during sessions.
