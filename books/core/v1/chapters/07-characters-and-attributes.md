## 7. Characters and Attributes

This chapter deepens the character framework introduced in Character Creation. It explains how
        Attributes define what your character is naturally good at, how those ratings interact with intent and
        approach, and how to think about Attribute growth over time. Skills and Proficiencies add texture and
        specialization. Attributes provide the core pillars those details rest on.

### Attributes Overview

Every character has four Attributes:

- **Might (MIG)**– Physical power, endurance, and resilience.
- **Agility (AGI)**– Speed, precision, balance, and reflexes.
- **Presence (PRE)**– Charisma, willpower, and social influence.
- **Reason (RSN)**– Logic, perception, memory, and analytical thinking.

Attribute ratings are small numbers that reflect how strongly each pillar shows up in play. During
        Character Creation, you assign a starting spread (usually 2, 1, 1, 0) across MIG, AGI, PRE, and RSN.
        Those ratings are then added to relevant checks throughout the campaign.

Attributes are always interpreted through the fiction. A high MIG character does not simply “have +2.”
        They push through heavy doors, endure long marches, and soak physical hardship more easily. A high RSN
        character spots patterns, recalls obscure details, and notices when something does not fit.

### Attribute Ratings and What They Mean

Attribute ratings are intentionally compact. Most characters begin with values between 0 and 2. This
        keeps the focus on intent, approach, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and the `4d6` dice
        results instead of on large numerical bonuses.

As a general guideline:

- **0**– Unremarkable. You can attempt normal tasks with no special edge or penalty.
- **1**– Competent. You are noticeably capable in this area compared to an average person.
- **2**– Exceptional. You stand out in most situations that rely on this Attribute.

When you make a Check, you roll**4d6**, sum the dice, and add your Attribute rating (and
        any other bonuses or penalties). You compare that total against a Difficulty Class (DC) from the
        standard ladder (typically DC 12–22). The difference between your total and the DC is the margin, which
        determines the outcome tier. A higher Attribute nudges those margins upward without guaranteeing any
        particular result.

### Choosing Your Starting Spread

During Character Creation, you assign a small array of values across your four Attributes. The default
        array is:

- One Attribute at**2**
- Two Attributes at**1**
- One Attribute at**0**

This spread creates characters who are competent across several areas with a clear primary strength and
        one relative weakness. You can think of this as your character’s natural “starting shape” before Skills,
        Proficiencies, Tags, and gear are layered on.

A useful way to choose your spread is to ask three questions:

- Which Attribute describes how you most often solve problems when under pressure?
- Which Attribute fits your concept but should remain a supporting strength rather than your main focus?
- Which Attribute would be interesting to struggle with?

Answering these questions usually reveals where to place your 2, your two 1s, and your 0. You are not
        optimizing a build—you are deciding what kind of situations will feel natural, challenging, or risky for
        this character.

### Attributes and Archetypes

Different spreads suggest different kinds of characters. The table below offers a few example archetypes.
        You do not need to use these labels at the table—they are here to help you think about possibilities.

Example Attribute Spreads and Archetypes

| Spread                     | Example Archetype         | Notes                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MIG 2, AGI 1, PRE 1, RSN 0 | Front-line problem solver | Leads with physical action and presence; relies on others for deep analysis.      |
| MIG 0, AGI 2, PRE 1, RSN 1 | Scout or infiltrator      | Excels at movement and precision; must negotiate around brute-force obstacles.    |
| MIG 1, AGI 0, PRE 2, RSN 1 | Negotiator or leader      | Strong in social scenes; needs help when delicate physical work is required.      |
| MIG 1, AGI 1, PRE 0, RSN 2 | Analyst or investigator   | Solves problems through observation and planning; may struggle to command a room. |

Use these examples as prompts, not prescriptions. You can apply any spread to any concept. A physically
        powerful scholar or a socially adept scout can be just as compelling as the “expected” combinations.

### Attributes, Intent, and Approach

Attributes are chosen based on*how*your character attempts something, not on what they would
        like to roll. The GM listens to your intent (what you are trying to achieve) and your approach (how you
        attempt it), then chooses the Attribute that best matches that description.

The same fictional goal can be resolved with different Attributes depending on approach:

- Prying open a stuck hatch with brute force might call for**MIG**.
- Picking the lock or working delicate mechanisms might call for**AGI**.
- Coaxing someone on the other side to open it might call for**PRE**.
- Analyzing the structure to find a weak point might call for**RSN**.

This flexibility keeps Attributes tied to the story. You do not choose an Attribute from a menu. You
        describe what your character does. The Attribute follows naturally from that description.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Calling for an Attribute**When a player describes intent and approach, repeat back what you heard in your own words, then say
>         which Attribute you think applies and why. If the table disagrees, adjust together. The goal is shared
>         understanding, not surprise rulings. If two Attributes seem equally valid, choose the one that fits the
>         character’s established habits, or offer the player a choice with different risks attached.

### Working with Low Attributes

A rating of 0 is not a punishment. It means your character does not naturally lean on that Attribute
        when things get tense. The game expects you to have at least one area where you are merely ordinary.

Low Attributes shape the story in interesting ways:

- A low MIG character might avoid direct contests of strength and instead look for tools, allies, or alternate routes.
- A low AGI character might favor careful planning over risky stunts.
- A low PRE character might rely on written communication, intermediaries, or quiet influence.
- A low RSN character might lean on intuition, experience, or other party members for analysis.

Play your weaknesses honestly and creatively. They provide hooks for growth, tension, and teamwork.
        When a situation hinges on your low Attribute, it does not mean you should stay silent. It means the
        stakes are higher, and failure may reveal something important about who you are.

### Examples by Attribute

#### Might (MIG)

Might represents physical strength, raw effort, and bodily resilience. It appears whenever you forcefully
        move, lift, or endure something.

> **Example**
> **Example – MIG Check**
*Trigger:*A storm has washed out a small bridge. The group needs to move a heavy improvised
>         plank into place before the river rises further.
*Roll:*The GM calls for a MIG-based Check using**4d6**against DC 16 (Tough). The
>         character with MIG 2 and the appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`.
*Consequence:*On a full success, the plank is set and the group crosses safely. On a partial
>         success, the plank holds but the character gains a Strained condition. On a failure, the plank slips,
>         and the GM advances a flood Clock.

#### Agility (AGI)

Agility covers balance, precision, and quick reactions. It appears when you dodge, climb, sneak, or
        operate fine mechanisms under pressure.

> **Example**
> **Example – AGI Check**
*Trigger:*A character sprints across slick rooftop tiles to reach a signal mast before an alarm
>         spreads.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 18 (Hard) due to rain and height. The character with AGI 1 and a relevant
>         Skill rolls `4d6+1`. A hazardous Tag on the roof may impose Burden if the group ignored earlier
>         warnings.
*Consequence:*On a full success, they reach the mast in time. On a partial success, they make
>         it but leave evidence behind or trigger a lesser alarm. On a failure, they slip, and the GM ticks a
>         danger Clock or applies a Condition such as Exposed or Dazed.

#### Presence (PRE)

Presence governs social force, confidence, and emotional weight. It appears when you persuade, command,
        intimidate, or rally others.

> **Example**
> **Example – PRE Check**
*Trigger:*The group needs a nervous official to delay a shipment. A character steps forward to
>         make the case.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 14 (Routine) if the request is modest, or higher if the stakes are severe.
>         The character with PRE 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`. Helpful Tags (Shared History) or
>         Proficiencies (Bureaucratic Procedures) may grant Edge.
*Consequence:*On a full success, the delay is granted cleanly. On a partial success, the delay
>         comes with a favor owed or a complication. On a failure, the official refuses and alerts a rival faction.

#### Reason (RSN)

Reason covers analysis, pattern recognition, and careful observation. It appears when you investigate,
        deduce, plan, or notice hidden details.

> **Example**
> **Example – RSN Check**
*Trigger:*A character studies overlapping telegraph logs to determine whether a recent outage is
>         natural or engineered.
*Roll:*The GM sets DC 16 (Tough). The character with RSN 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls
>         `4d6+2`. A relevant Proficiency (Telegraph Instruments) may lower the DC or reveal extra context on a
>         success.
*Consequence:*On a full success, they identify the outage as deliberate and tie it to a specific
>         region. On a partial success, they confirm it was engineered but only narrow the possibilities. On a
>         failure, they misinterpret the data and the GM advances a faction Clock based on that error.

### Multi-Attribute Actions and Teamwork

Many scenes involve multiple characters and overlapping actions. Instead of treating every moment as a
        separate Check, think about how Attributes combine across the group.

- One character might use MIG to hold a door while another uses RSN to bypass its lock.
- A PRE-focused character might draw attention so an AGI-focused ally can move unseen.
- Two characters with different strengths might both roll, with the table focusing on the more
          interesting result.

The GM decides whether each character rolls separately, one character rolls with assistance, or a single
        roll represents the group’s combined effort. Whichever option you choose, keep intent and approach in
        view. Assistance should make sense in the fiction, not just on the character sheet.

### Attribute Growth Preview

Attributes do not change every session. They grow slowly across a campaign as characters reach important
        milestones, resolve personal threads, and survive significant consequences. Advancement rules appear in
        the Advancement and Long Term Growth chapter later in this book.

When Attributes do increase, the change should feel meaningful in the fiction. A rise in MIG might come
        after a season of hard labor or survival in harsh conditions. A rise in RSN might follow extended study,
        investigative breakthroughs, or hard lessons learned from mistakes. Treat Attribute growth as an
        opportunity to reflect on how the character has changed, not just as a numerical upgrade.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Signaling Growth**When a player increases an Attribute, ask them to describe one moment from the campaign that symbolizes
>         that change. Then add a Tag to the world, a new relationship, or an updated detail on the character’s
>         sheet that reflects their growth. This keeps advancement grounded in the shared story rather than only
>         in numbers.
