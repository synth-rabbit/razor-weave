## 18. Extended Tags and Conditions Reference

This chapter expands the overview from Chapter 9 into a deeper reference. It gathers common Tags and
        Conditions into categories, explains how to use them across genres, and offers guidance for creating new
        entries. You do not need to memorize every detail. Instead, treat this chapter as a toolbox you can glance
        at when you want inspiration or clarity about how a particular descriptor might work in play.

### Tags in Depth

Tags are short descriptors applied to scenes, locations, objects, or situations. They are reminders that
        certain details should matter whenever characters act in that context. A Tag rarely changes the core
        procedure of a Check; instead, it adjusts how hard an action is, how risky it feels, or how effective it
        can be. Tags are one of your main tools for making the fiction mechanically meaningful.

In this system, Tags most often:

- Grant Advantage or Disadvantage on specific Checks.
- Shift DCs up or down along the standard ladder (Easy 12 to Legendary 22).
- Change position and effect—how exposed you are if something goes wrong, or how much impact success has.

A good Tag has three qualities:

- **Clear fiction:**The table can easily picture what the Tag means.
- **Mechanical teeth:**It obviously helps some actions and hinders others.
- **Limited scope:**It does not try to describe everything about a scene—only a few key aspects.

### Environmental Tags

Environmental Tags describe physical space: light, footing, cover, elevation, and other features that shape
        movement and line of sight. They are often present before characters arrive and may persist across multiple
        scenes until something in the fiction changes them.

Environmental Tags********************************

| Tag           | What It Represents                                                          | Typical Effects                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dim Light     | Shadows, poor lighting, or night conditions.                                | Advantage on Stealth and hiding; Disadvantage on detailed Perception and long‑range attacks.                              |
| Obscured      | Fog, smoke, heavy rain, or cluttered sightlines.                            | Disadvantage on sight‑based Perception; may grant Advantage to ambushes and escapes.                                      |
| Slick         | Wet stone, oil, ice, or unstable footing.                                   | Disadvantage on fast movement and risky maneuvers; Failures may inflict Conditions or new Tags.                           |
| Cramped       | Tight corridors, low ceilings, or packed shelves.                           | Disadvantage on actions that need space (large weapons, sweeping attacks); may grant Advantage when bracing or grappling. |
| Elevated      | Higher ground, vantage points, or raised platforms.                         | Advantage on many ranged attacks and observation Checks; movement to or from elevation may require Checks.                |
| Solid Cover   | Reliable barriers—stone walls, heavy crates, reinforced barricades.         | Advantage on defense from certain angles; may block some attacks entirely unless flanked or bypassed.                     |
| Fragile Cover | Barriers that can be destroyed—thin walls, wooden crates, glass partitions. | Advantage on defense until damaged; Partial Successes or repeated hits may destroy cover and create new hazards.          |
| Unstable      | Rattling catwalks, loose stones, precarious stacks.                         | Checks that move or add weight risk advancing Clocks or causing falls; Failures often make the environment worse.         |

### Situational and Atmospheric Tags

Situational Tags describe pressures and circumstances that may change rapidly as scenes unfold. Atmospheric
        Tags describe the emotional or social tone of a moment. Both help you highlight what matters right now in
        the fiction and give players cues about what approaches are likely to work.

Situational & Atmospheric Tags********************************

| Tag          | What It Represents                                                      | Typical Effects                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Crowded      | Many people sharing a small space: markets, rallies, evacuation queues. | Harder to move quickly or track a single person; easier to blend in or lose a tail.                                    |
| Alert        | Guards or observers actively watching for trouble.                      | Higher DCs for Stealth and deception; Failures more likely to trigger immediate consequences.                          |
| Hazardous    | Meaningful risk of harm from the environment or situation.              | Partial Successes and Failures may inflict Conditions, tick threat Clocks, or escalate danger.                         |
| Surveillance | Cameras, monitoring spells, informants, or watchful neighbors.          | Covert actions risk leaving a trace; some Failures may not trigger immediate danger but add to future complications.   |
| Tense        | Frayed tempers, suspicion, or high stakes in conversation.              | Higher DCs for clumsy social approaches; successful calm or empathetic actions may clear the Tag.                      |
| Festive      | Celebrations, parties, or communal joy.                                 | Easier to mingle, gather casual information, or go unnoticed; harder to hold solemn attention.                         |
| Solemn       | Funerals, vigils, official ceremonies.                                  | Respectful approaches gain trust; overt disruption may have outsized social consequences.                              |
| Suspicious   | People are already on edge or expecting trouble.                        | DCs for lies and half‑truths rise; honest or vulnerable approaches may be more effective than elaborate cover stories. |

> **Example**
> **Example – Combining Tags in a Scene**
A street protest has the Tags*Crowded*,*Tense*, and*Surveillance*. A PC trying to
>         slip through without notice may gain Advantage on AGI + Stealth & Evasion thanks to*Crowded*,
>         but attempts to stage a covert meeting in the middle of the rally risk advancing a “Authorities Respond”
>         Clock because of*Surveillance*. PRE‑based attempts to calm a brewing clash face higher DCs under*Tense*, while a carefully framed speech might clear that Tag if it succeeds.

### Creating Your Own Tags

You are encouraged to invent Tags that fit your campaign. When doing so, keep the following questions in
        mind:

- What detail in the fiction am I trying to highlight?
- Which actions should become easier, and which should become riskier?
- Does this Tag suggest interesting complications on Partial Success or Failure?

Once you name a Tag, quickly agree at the table how it behaves. If you find that a Tag is not pulling its
        weight—no one remembers it or it never affects decisions—either retire it or sharpen its effects so that
        it matters.

### Conditions in Depth

Conditions are persistent states attached to characters. They represent injuries, emotions, afflictions, or
        temporary edges that follow you across scenes until cleared. Where Tags describe the world around you,
        Conditions describe what you are carrying with you—physically, mentally, or socially.

Most Conditions:

- Impose Disadvantage on specific categories of Checks.
- Limit safe options (“you can’t sprint on that leg,” “you can’t act this turn”).
- Threaten escalation if ignored, often via Clocks or worsening states.

This chapter groups common Conditions by type and offers guidance for introducing and clearing them in a
        way that supports character stories rather than shutting them down.

### Physical Conditions

Physical Conditions represent injuries, exhaustion, or bodily harm. They are often the result of combat,
        hazards, overexertion, or environmental exposure.

Physical Conditions********************

| Condition  | What It Represents                                           | Typical Effects & Clearing                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exhausted  | Deep fatigue from sustained effort, lack of rest, or stress. | Disadvantage on demanding physical actions and Checks using MIG or AGI approaches for many scenes; clears with meaningful rest or care.                              |
| Bleeding   | An active wound that will worsen without treatment.          | Time pressure; certain actions may risk further harm. Usually paired with a short Clock such as “Stabilize Wound”; clears with field treatment or medical attention. |
| Restrained | Held, tied, pinned, or otherwise unable to move freely.      | Cannot change position or perform many physical actions; Checks to break free or receive help can clear or downgrade this Condition.                                 |
| Poisoned   | Exposed to harmful substances that impair or injure.         | Disadvantage on a range of actions; may inflict periodic damage or tick a “Toxin Spreads” Clock. Clears via antidotes, medical care, or time, depending on fiction.  |
| Marked     | Specifically targeted or tracked by a foe.                   | Enemies gain Advantage on certain attacks or Checks against you until the mark is removed (breaking line of sight, changing appearance, or defeating the threat).    |

### Mental and Social Conditions

Mental and social Conditions reflect fear, distraction, obsession, or shifts in reputation and trust. They
        show how events leave marks on characters’ thoughts and relationships, not just their bodies.

Mental & Social Conditions********************

| Condition              | What It Represents                                                 | Typical Effects & Clearing                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frightened             | Overwhelming fear tied to a specific threat or situation.          | Disadvantage on actions taken while the source is present; clears by escaping, rallying, or confronting the cause.                                                              |
| Suppressed             | Shaken confidence, intimidation, or social pressure.               | Disadvantage on the next bold or assertive action; usually clears after one meaningful attempt or supportive roleplaying.                                                       |
| Distracted             | Split focus due to pain, competing demands, or intrusive thoughts. | Disadvantage on careful or complex tasks; clears when the distracting factor is addressed or set aside.                                                                         |
| Compromised Reputation | A hit to standing in a community or group.                         | Higher DCs or Disadvantage on certain social Checks with that community; clears via reparative actions, public successes, or narrative milestones.                              |
| Obsessed               | Fixated on a goal, person, or mystery.                             | Advantage on related research or pursuit; Disadvantage when asked to ignore or abandon the object of focus. Clears through resolution, intervention, or personal growth scenes. |

> **Example**
> **Example – Layered Conditions**
After a disastrous negotiation and a physical escape, a PC ends up both*Exhausted*and*Compromised Reputation*with a local guild. Their attempts to fix the situation may require RSN +
>         Lore & Analysis or PRE + Persuasion & Appeal Checks at higher DCs, while physical stunts are risky
>         until they rest. As they address each Condition in play—resting, apologizing, making amends—those
>         Conditions clear, marking character change.

### Severity and Progression

Some Conditions are best treated as points along a progression rather than isolated states. For example, an
        injury might start as*Bruised*, escalate to*Wounded*, and culminate in a more serious
        Condition if repeatedly ignored. You do not need a rigid track for every case, but thinking in terms of
        “light, moderate, severe” consequences can help you calibrate how hard recovery should be.

When upgrading or downgrading Conditions, announce what is happening in the fiction first—then adjust the
        label to match. This keeps Conditions tied to story beats instead of feeling like abstract status effects.

### Tags, Conditions, and Clocks Together

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks become most powerful when used together. Tags set the stage; Conditions mark
        what has happened to the characters; Clocks track how close you are to change. Many worked examples in
        earlier chapters already combine them. This section adds a few patterns you can reuse.

- **Environment → Condition:**A*Hazardous*Tag makes certain Failures inflict*Bleeding*,*Poisoned*, or*Frightened*.
- **Condition → Clock:**A serious injury creates a “Recover From Wound” Clock instead of clearing after a single scene.
- **Clock → Tag:**As a threat Clock fills, it may add new Tags—*Smoke‑Filled*,*Panic Rising*,*Martial Law*.

> **Example**
> **Example – Hazard, Condition, and Clock**
The group explores a collapsing mine tagged*Hazardous*and*Unstable*. Early on, a Failure on
>         a MIG + Athletic Movement Check inflicts*Bleeding*on one PC and ticks a “Tunnel Collapse” Clock.
>         Later, as the Clock fills, the GM adds a new Tag—*Dust‑Choked*—which makes RSN + Perception &
>         Awareness Checks harder and threatens*Exhausted*if characters linger. By the time they escape, the
>         mine’s Tags and their Conditions tell the story of what it cost to get out.

### Designing New Conditions

When you invent a new Condition, follow the same pattern as Tags:

- Name what has changed for the character in the fiction.
- Specify which kinds of Checks it helps or hinders (if any).
- Decide how it escalates if ignored and how it can be cleared.

Conditions do not need intricate, numeric rules to matter. If everyone understands what*Haunted*,*Homesick*, or*On Thin Ice With the Guild*means, the table can apply Disadvantage, DC
        shifts, or narrative constraints consistently as situations arise.

### Beneficial Conditions and Edges

Not all Conditions are penalties. Some represent moments of insight, protection, or support that tilt the
        odds in your favor. These “edge” Conditions work like other Conditions—they are named, they have clear
        triggers and clearing conditions—but they grant advantages when the fiction supports them.

Beneficial Conditions********************

| Condition           | What It Represents                                                | Typical Effects & Clearing                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inspired            | A burst of confidence or insight grounded in recent events.       | Advantage on one or a few Checks tied to the source of inspiration (a speech, a victory, a vow); clears once that benefit is used or the scene ends.                                     |
| Sheltered           | Taking cover under protection—physical, social, or institutional. | Reduced effect or Disadvantage on attacks against you from certain angles or factions; clears when you leave protection or it is withdrawn.                                              |
| Bolstered           | Reassurance, magical warding, or careful preparation.             | Advantage on Checks to resist a specific danger (fear, charm, fire, interrogation); often tied to a short Clock or a single scene.                                                       |
| Focused             | Calm, centered attention on a task or goal.                       | Advantage on RSN‑heavy or precision actions related to the focus; may impose Disadvantage on unrelated impulsive choices; clears when you are interrupted or choose to break focus.      |
| Backed by Authority | Acting with formal sanction, warrants, or clear mandate.          | Lower DCs or Advantage on social Checks with people who respect that authority; higher DCs when dealing with those who resent or fear it. Clears when the mandate expires or is revoked. |

You can add beneficial Conditions when characters earn them through play—completing preparation, forging
        alliances, or achieving symbolic victories. They are a good way to reward smart choices without rewriting
        core mechanics and to show how earlier scenes echo forward into new challenges.

### Genre Tag & Condition Packs

Different genres emphasize different Tags and Conditions. You do not need separate rules for each genre,
        but it can be helpful to think in terms of “packs” you are likely to reuse. The lists below are starting
        points—add, remove, or rename entries to fit your specific setting.

Cozy & Slice‑of‑Life Pack****************

| Focus                          | Common Tags  | Common Conditions |

You can sketch a quick genre pack at session zero and keep it nearby as a menu. When framing scenes, glance
        at the pack and ask which Tags and Conditions feel appropriate. Over time, you will discover recurring
        combinations that help your table recognize the feel of your campaign at a glance.

### At the Table: Quick Procedure

When you are in the middle of play and do not want to stop for long lists, use this short procedure:

1. **Describe first.**Paint the scene in plain language—what feels unstable, crowded, eerie, or hopeful.
1. **Name 1–3 Tags.**Turn the most important details into Tags that will matter for Checks.
1. **Roll and resolve.**Apply Tags and existing Conditions as Advantage/Disadvantage, DC shifts, or changes to consequences.
1. **Update states.**If the outcome is significant, add or clear Conditions or adjust Clocks.
1. **Move on.**Do not retag everything every round; only update when the fiction clearly changes.

If you are ever unsure which mechanical tweak to use, start with Advantage/Disadvantage. Only reach for DC
        shifts or new Clocks when you want to signal larger changes in risk or pacing.
