## 20. Optional and Variant Rules

The core rules are written to cover many tables and genres. You can play entire campaigns using only the
        default procedures in this book. This chapter offers optional and variant rules—dials you can turn to tune
        pacing, difficulty, and tone without breaking the core structure. Treat them as a menu. You do not need all
        of them, and you should add them deliberately rather than all at once.

### Choosing Variants for Your Table

Before adopting any variant rule, talk about:

- **Desired tone:**grounded, heroic, cozy, horror‑leaning, or something else.
- **Pacing:**slow burn campaigns vs fast‑moving series.
- **Complexity appetite:**how many moving parts your group enjoys tracking.

Start small: choose one or two variants that clearly support your goals. Play with them for several
        sessions. If they work, keep them. If not, remove or revise them with a quick conversation at the table.

### Pacing and Difficulty Variants

These options change how quickly the story escalates and how hard the game feels, without changing the
        core 4d6 + DC structure.

| Variant             | What Changes                                                                                                                                                                  | Use When                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Gentle Pacing       | Use more DC 12–14 tasks; reserve DC 18+ for boss moments. Pressure Clocks fill more slowly.                                                                                   | You want relaxed, character‑focused play where failure still matters but is less punishing.      |
| High‑Tension Pacing | Default to DC 14–16 for meaningful challenges; pressure Clocks advance on more Partial Successes.                                                                             | You want sessions to feel urgent, with frequent tough choices and visible pressure.              |
| Heroic Baseline     | Characters begin with one “edge” Condition (such as                                                                                                                           | Inspired                                                                                         | or | Bolstered | ) each
                session that they can cash in for Advantage on a pivotal Check. | You want characters to feel competent and lucky, especially in climactic scenes. |
| Gritty Consequences | Partial Successes in combat or hazardous zones more often inflict Conditions and advance threat
                Clocks, even when the immediate goal is achieved.             | You want danger to leave lasting marks and for recovery scenes to matter.                        |
| Montage Resolution  | For some sequences (travel, research, prep), resolve a series of Checks as a single montage, ticking
                multiple Clocks at once based on the final outcome tier. | You want to keep spotlight on key scenes while still honoring risks taken during longer efforts. |

### Table‑Focused Options

These variants focus on how the group makes decisions and shares narrative responsibility, rather than on
        changing numbers.

- **Shared Framing Rotation:**Once per session, a player other than the GM frames a scene:
          where it takes place, who is present, and what is at stake. The GM still runs NPCs and rules, but this
          ensures each player’s interests surface regularly.
- **Player‑Authored Tags:**At the start of each session, invite players to propose one Tag
          each for a location, faction, or situation they care about (“Tense Bargaining Season,” “Storms on the
          Plateau”). The GM weaves these Tags into scenes.
- **Rotating Spotlight Questions:**At the end of a session, ask one player a prompt aligned
          with their character (for example, “What did you learn today that scares you?”). Use their answer to seed
          Tags, Conditions, or fronts for the next session.

> **Example**
> **Example – Player‑Authored Tag**
At session start, a player adds the Tag*Festival Week*to the city. Throughout play, the GM
>         introduces crowded streets, temporary stalls, and visiting dignitaries. Checks involving movement, rumor‑
>         gathering, and security now frequently interact with*Crowded*,*Festive*, and*Surveillance*Tags the table chose together.

### Resolution Variants

The core resolution uses a single Check for most actions. These variants adjust how many Checks you use and
        how much narrative weight each roll carries, while still relying on 4d6 and outcome tiers.

- **Ask Once, Roll Once:**For groups who prefer fewer rolls, resolve complex actions with a
          single Check and a richer outcome. Use Clocks and Tags to represent intermediate steps instead of multiple
          separate Checks.
- **Granular Challenges:**For groups who enjoy tactical detail, break big tasks into several
          linked Checks, each with its own Tag or Clock. Make sure each roll moves the situation forward in a clear
          way.
- **Group Checks:**When the whole group works together and the details of individual rolls
          are less important, have everyone roll but only count a subset (for example, the highest two results) to
          determine the outcome tier.
- **Spotlight Checks:**In key emotional scenes, roll once for the character most central to
          the moment and treat others’ contributions as fictional positioning that may influence DC or Tags rather
          than separate rolls.

### Safety and Calibration Tools

Safety and calibration tools help your table align on tone and boundaries. They are not optional for every
        group, but they are always available. You can use them alongside any other variant in this chapter.

- **Lines and Veils:**Early in the campaign, the group names topics they do not want in the
          game at all (lines) and topics that can appear only off‑screen or in soft focus (veils). Keep a written
          list and revisit it as needed.
- **Check‑In Breaks:**When a scene touches intense material, pause briefly to ask if everyone
          is comfortable continuing. Adjust course if anyone expresses discomfort.
- **Open Door:**Make it explicit that any player can step away from the table at any time for
          any reason, without needing to justify it in detail. If they do, the group finds a respectful way to
          pause or continue.
- **Tone Calibration:**At the end of a session, ask quick questions like “More danger or less?”
          or “More character drama or more problem‑solving?” Use answers to steer future scenes.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Safety Is a Shared Tool**
Safety tools are not just for “heavy” campaigns. They help any table adjust tone and content over time. Treat
>         them as part of the rules: visible, normal, and available to everyone.

### Campaign Structure Variants

Finally, you can adjust how you structure campaigns and advancement together. These variants change the
        rhythm of arcs and how you move between them.

- **Seasonal Play:**Treat each 6–10 session arc as a “season” with its own fronts and central
          questions. Between seasons, hold an advancement and recalibration session where you adjust advancement
          pacing, Tags, and fronts for the next season.
- **Rotating Focus:**Every arc, center one or two characters’ goals while others support. Use
          advancement from Chapter 19 to highlight those goals, then rotate focus for the next arc.
- **One‑Shot Mode:**For short games, use Heroic Baseline, grant 1–2 advancements mid‑session or
          at the end, and keep fronts and Clocks simple. Treat Tags and Conditions as big, loud signals about what
          matters in a brief story.

You do not need to adopt any variant rule to enjoy the system. When you do choose them, do so in service of
        the stories you want to tell and the ways your table enjoys telling them. The core structure—fiction first,
        4d6 Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—remains the same.
