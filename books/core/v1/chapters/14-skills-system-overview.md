## 14. Skills System Overview

Skills are fiction‑first capabilities that define what your character can reliably do when the outcome is
        uncertain. They represent practiced competencies—from climbing a precarious cliff to negotiating a trade
        deal, from repairing relay equipment to navigating orbital traffic. This chapter explains what Skills
        represent, how they interact with Attributes and Checks, and how to choose and create Skills that fit
        your campaign.

### What Skills Represent

**Skills**are not abstract numbers. They are grounded in your character's experiences, training, and
        environment. A character with Stealth knows how to move quietly, read patrol patterns, and exploit
        shadows. A character with Persuasion understands how to frame requests, read social dynamics, and build
        rapport. When you roll a Skill Check, you are asking: "Given who this character is and what the situation
        is, can they accomplish this goal?"

Skills always operate on the fiction‑first principle introduced earlier:

- If the fiction does not support an action, no roll happens.
- If the action is certain to succeed or fail given the situation, the GM simply describes the result.
- Only when uncertainty, consequence, and agency align does a Skill Check come into play.

> **Example**
> **Example – When a Skill Matters**
In a cozy neighborhood campaign, a character with Baking might roll to impress a skeptical community elder
>         with a carefully prepared cake, gaining Advantage on future social scenes with that community. In a sci‑fi
>         relay station, a character with Systems Diagnostics might roll to stabilize failing life support. Both are
>         “skills,” but the way they appear in the fiction depends on the setting and the situation.

### Skills and Attributes

Skills and Attributes work together. Attributes describe broad tendencies—Might (MIG), Agility (AGI),
        Presence (PRE), and Reason (RSN). Skills sharpen those tendencies into specific competencies. A Check
        typically uses one Attribute and, when appropriate, one Skill that fits the declared intent and approach.

The same Skill can pair with different Attributes depending on how you act:

- Using Stealth with AGI when you move quietly through a crowded market.
- Using Stealth with RSN when you plan a route that avoids patrol patterns entirely.
- Using Persuasion with PRE when you speak with emotional conviction.
- Using Persuasion with RSN when you construct a careful, logical argument.

This flexibility keeps Skills tied to the story rather than locked into fixed formulas. The GM chooses
        the Attribute that best matches your described approach, then checks whether a Skill meaningfully applies.

### Skill Categories

To make it easier to navigate options, Skills are loosely grouped into broad categories. These categories
        are descriptive, not restrictive, and can overlap:

- **Exploration**– Perception, Wayfinding, Investigation, Climbing, Tinkering.
- **Social**– Persuasion, Negotiation, Insight, Deception, Comfort.
- **Technical**– Medicine, Thievery, Hacking, Engineering, Forensics.
- **Conflict**– Melee Combat, Firearms, Tactics, Zero‑G Combat, Crowd Control.
- **Arcane or Supernatural**– Arcana, Occult Lore, Ritual, Divination.
- **Wilderness and Environment**– Survival, Animal Handling, Gardening, Foraging.

Chapters 15 and 17 provide example Skills grouped by Attribute and domain, with genre‑specific lists you
        can use as written or adapt to your setting.

### Reading Skill Entries

Each Skill entry in the reference chapters follows a consistent structure:

- **Name and category**– The Skill’s name and where it fits (Exploration, Social, etc.).
- **Description**– A fiction‑first explanation of what the Skill covers and how it feels in play.
- **Default actions**– Common tasks and typical DC ranges (using the standard DC ladder).
- **Synergies**– Tags, Conditions, or Proficiencies that make this Skill more effective.
- **Counters**– Situations or Tags that hinder the Skill.
- **GM usage notes**– Advice on when to call for rolls and how to interpret outcome tiers.
- **Example**– A short worked example showing the Skill in context.

When you read a Skill entry, start with the description and example. They tell you how it shows up in the
        fiction. Numbers and DCs come after.

### Choosing Skills at Character Creation

During Character Creation, you select a small set of Skills that define what your character reliably does
        under pressure. When choosing Skills, keep four questions in mind:

- **Does this fit the genre?**A haunted relay station game will see more use from
          Engineering and Occult Lore than from Tournament Jousting.
- **Does this fit my concept?**A former smuggler might take Navigation, Streetwise, and
          Deception; a village healer might focus on Medicine, Gardening, and Comfort.
- **Does this complement the group?**If no one has Medicine or Tactics, consider covering
          that gap. Redundancy can be fun, but shared blind spots are risky.
- **Is this a Skill I want to lean into?**Choose Skills you are excited to see in play; you
          can grow into new areas later.

> **Example**
> **Example – Selecting Skills for a Concept**
A player creates Rami, a courier who once worked the telegraph lines in a canyon region. They choose
>         Stealth, Systems Diagnostics, Wayfinding, and Mediation. Stealth and Wayfinding reflect years of moving
>         through rough terrain unnoticed. Systems Diagnostics ties into relay maintenance. Mediation represents
>         their habit of smoothing over disputes between outposts. The Skill list says as much about who Rami is as
>         their attributes do.

### Creating Custom Skills

The provided Skill lists are starting points. If a Skill you want is missing, you and your GM can create a
        custom one. A good custom Skill has a clear scope, fits your genre, and gives the GM obvious hooks for
        scenes where it matters. “Social Media Savvy” might be perfect for a modern campaign but feel out of
        place in a low‑magic village game; “Wayfinding” makes sense across many genres.

When you design a new Skill together, start by writing a short description in plain language. Decide what
        kinds of actions it covers, what typical difficulties feel like, and what situations make it shine or
        struggle. You do not need to list every possible use; two or three concrete examples are enough to anchor
        the Skill in play.

> **Example**
> **Example – Defining a Custom Skill**
In a modern investigative campaign, the group adds*Digital Forensics*as a Technical Skill.
*Description:*Analyze digital devices, recover deleted data, and trace online activity.
*Default actions:*Recover deleted files (DC 14–18), trace a message’s origin (DC 16–20), detect
>         tampering (DC 12–16).
*Synergies:*Networked or Surveillance Tags, relevant Proficiencies like Cybercrime.
*Counters:*Air‑gapped systems, encrypted drives, Alert adversaries.
The GM now has a clear sense of when and how to call for Digital Forensics Checks.

### Designing Skills for Your Campaign

When you add new Skills or reshape existing ones, think about how they will read on a character sheet and
        how they will show up in play. A strong Skill name hints at what the character does in scenes, not just
        which numbers they add to a roll. “Crowd Control,” “Wayfinding,” or “Social Media Savvy” all suggest
        specific kinds of moments; “+2 Physical” does not.

As a rule of thumb when designing Skills:

- **Lead with actions.**Choose names that describe what characters do: “Calibrating Sensors,” “Negotiating Contracts,” “Reading People,” “Improvised Repairs.”
- **Avoid totalizing labels.**“All Combat” is too broad. “Close‑Quarters Struggle” and “Ranged Technique” are narrow enough to feel distinct but broad enough to recur.
- **Differentiate by approach, not target.**“Lockpicking” and “Fine Manipulation” overlap; consider whether you want a general Skill or a specialized one and how each will feel in multiple scenes.
- **Check against Proficiencies.**If a proposed Skill sounds more like a job (“Harbor Operations”) than a repeatable action, it might belong as a Proficiency instead.
- **Look for genre hooks.**Ask yourself which environments, factions, or threats will regularly invite this Skill to the forefront.

You can also collaborate with your group to build short campaign‑specific Skill menus. A cozy neighborhood
        game might highlight Skills like Baking, Comfort, Streetwise, and Community Mediation. A horror‑mystery
        game might focus on Investigation, Forensics, Occult Lore, and Crisis Negotiation. The mechanical
        structure stays the same; the Skill names and examples shift to match the tone, scale, and stakes of the
        stories you want to tell.

### Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and Conditions

Skills rarely act alone. Proficiencies deepen them, Tags color the environment around them, and Conditions
        bend them out of shape. A Proficiency in a particular domain often makes related Skill Checks easier or
        safer. Tags such as*Dim Light*,*Cramped*, or*Networked*tilt odds toward or away
        from certain Skills. Conditions like*Exhausted*or*Frightened*can narrow which approaches
        remain reasonable, even when you technically have the Skill.

> **Example**
> **Example – Skill with Proficiency and Tags**
A character with the Systems Diagnostics Skill and the “Telegraph Instruments” Proficiency attempts to
>         stabilize a failing relay in a canyon station. The scene has the Tags*Dim Light*and*Unstable*due to flickering lamps and tremors.
The GM decides the Proficiency lowers the effective DC and grants Advantage on RSN + Systems Diagnostics
>         Checks. However,*Unstable*means failures may tick a “Structural Collapse” Clock. The Skill,
>         Proficiency, and Tags combine to make the moment specific and tense.

### Using the Skill Reference Chapters

The chapters that follow provide concrete Skill lists and examples. Chapter 15 groups Skills by Attribute
        and offers sample entries you can adopt or adapt. Chapter 17 does the same for Proficiencies, showing how
        they sharpen certain Skills or open new options in the fiction.

You do not need to memorize every entry. When you create or advance a character, scan the parts that match
        your campaign’s tone and pick what supports your concept. During play, treat the lists as inspiration. If
        you describe an approach that fits the fiction, you and the GM can decide together which Skill applies,
        even if it is not on a printed menu.
