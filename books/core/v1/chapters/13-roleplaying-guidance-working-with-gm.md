## 13. Roleplaying Guidance and Working with the GM

This chapter focuses on how to play the game well at the table—how to inhabit your character, share
        spotlight, read the fiction, and collaborate with the GM and other players. The mechanics in earlier
        chapters provide tools. This chapter helps you use them in a way that keeps play fun, clear, and
        respectful for everyone.

### Roleplaying Fundamentals

Roleplaying means making decisions from your character’s point of view. You do not need to speak in
        accents or stay “in character” every minute, but it helps to:

- Think about what your character wants, fears, and cares about.
- Let those priorities shape your choices, even when they are not tactically perfect.
- React to events as your character, not just as a player solving a puzzle.

Your goal is not to “win” the story. It is to help create a story that everyone at the table is excited
        to remember.

### Creating Memorable Characters

Memorable characters often share three traits:

- **Distinct voice**– A recognizable way of speaking or behaving.
- **Clear motivations**– Goals and drives that explain why they act.
- **Flaws and strengths**– Imperfections that create conflict and qualities that carry them.

Voice can be as simple as a few phrases, a posture, or a habit. Motivations might be justice, curiosity,
        loyalty, or survival. Flaws—stubbornness, pride, mistrust—give scenes bite. Strengths—compassion,
        courage, expertise—give your character ways to shine.

### Engaging with the Fiction

The game works best when everyone treats the fiction as real and worth caring about:

- **Describe actions**– Go beyond “I attack.” Show how you move, what you say, what it looks like.
- **React to outcomes**– Let successes, partials, and failures change how your character feels and behaves.
- **Build on details**– When someone adds a detail, treat it as a resource, not background noise.

If the GM says the tavern smells of smoke, decide whether that makes your character nostalgic, uneasy, or
        indifferent. Small reactions accumulate into a rich portrayal.

### Making Meaningful Choices

Meaningful choices are grounded in both character and situation:

- Ask, “What would my character do here?” and take that seriously, even if it is risky.
- Embrace consequences; partial successes and failures are fuel for interesting scenes.
- Consider how your decision opens space for other characters to respond or grow.

You always retain control over your character’s actions and internal life. The GM brings the world; you
        decide how your character engages with it.

### Roleplaying in Different Scenes

#### Combat Scenes

Combat is not only about tactics. It is also about how your character responds to danger:

- Use your choices of Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, and Defend/Withdraw to show priorities—who you protect,
          what risks you accept.
- Let Conditions and Resolve Clocks show up in your description. Stagger when hurt, hesitate when*Frightened*, push through when it matters.
- React when others suffer; a quiet character might become decisive when an ally falls.

#### Social Scenes

In social scenes, your words and posture matter. You do not have to improvise every line, but try to:

- Summarize what your character says, focusing on tone and intent.
- Show emotion through description—body language, pauses, eye contact.
- Pay attention to NPC reactions and adjust your approach when the fiction calls for it.

#### Exploration Scenes

Exploration scenes reveal what your character notices and cares about when there is no immediate threat.
        Curious characters poke at details; cautious ones check exits; idealists look for people to help. Use
        these scenes to reinforce who you are outside of crisis.

### Player Tips for Success

A few practical habits make play smoother and more satisfying. Taking five minutes before a session to
        review your character, their current situation, and what you want to pursue can make a big difference.
        Jotting simple notes—names, locations, promises—keeps threads from slipping away between games.

Many players find it helpful to set a small, personal goal each session: “I want to confront my mentor,”
        “I want to make peace with that faction,” or “I want to learn more about the vanished relay line.” These
        goals give the GM something to weave into scenes and help you decide what your character pushes toward
        when choices arise.

Tactically, you do not need to master every rule to play well. Focus on three questions:

- How can we use terrain and Tags to our advantage in this scene?
- Is anyone carrying dangerous Conditions we should clear or mitigate?
- What can I do this turn to make an ally’s next action stronger?

> **Example**
> **Example – A Simple Plan**
Before a session, a player notes that their character wants to repair trust with a contact they previously
>         lied to. When the GM frames a scene at that contact’s workshop, the player leans into it—offering a sincere
>         apology and a concrete favor. The GM rewards this with a small improvement in standing and a future lead.
>         A few minutes of preparation turned a casual scene into a memorable character moment.

### Reading the Table

Good play also means paying attention to the table, not just the fiction. When another player leans
        forward, takes notes, or lights up at a detail, that is a cue that this thread matters to them. When
        someone has been quiet for a while, you can create space for them with a simple question: “What is your
        character doing while this happens?”

The GM’s descriptions are cues as well. If they linger on a Tag, repeat an NPC’s name, or mention a small
        oddity twice, it usually means that element is important. If you are unsure what a scene is about, ask
        briefly out of character: “What is at stake here?” Clarity helps everyone aim their actions in the same
        direction.

> **Example**
> **Example – Inviting Someone In**
During an investigation scene, two players are debating theories while a third stays quiet. One of the
>         debaters pauses and says, “You grew up in this district—what do you think is really going on?” The quiet
>         player’s character suddenly becomes central to the scene, sharing local knowledge the others lacked. A
>         small invitation shifted focus in a way that felt natural in the fiction.

### Spotlight Sharing and Party Cohesion

Sharing spotlight keeps the game from becoming “the story of one character with supporting cast.” You do
        not need to track minutes of talk time, but it helps to be aware of patterns. If you have been at the
        center of the last few scenes, consider how your character might support others next—by asking for help,
        following someone else’s lead, or taking an assisting action instead of the decisive one.

Stepping forward and stepping back are both generous acts. Step forward when your character’s skills,
        history, or goals are central to the moment. Step back when someone else is in their focus scene and make
        their moment stronger with Set Ups, assistance, or simply by reacting in character.

Many tables like to create shared backstory—why the group is together, who they owe, what they have
        survived. These connections make it easier to care about one another’s scenes.

> **Example**
> **Example – Supporting Someone Else’s Spotlight**
A session centers on another character’s estranged sibling arriving in town. Rather than trying to solve
>         the sibling’s problems, the rest of the group plays into the situation: one offers quiet moral support,
>         another runs interference with a suspicious faction, a third uses a Set Up action in a later conflict to
>         give the spotlight character Advantage. Everyone gets to act, but the emotional core of the session stays
>         with the sibling relationship.

### Working with the GM

The GM is your collaborator, not your opponent. They present the world, frame situations, and play NPCs.
        You bring your character’s perspective and choices. Good collaboration looks like:

Share your character’s goals and interests so the GM knows what to put on screen. Ask clarifying
        questions when stakes or details are unclear; it is better to pause for thirty seconds than to play
        through a scene everyone misunderstood. When consequences land, treat them as prompts for new choices
        rather than reasons to pull back from the game.

If something at the table is not working for you—tone, pacing, or content—say so. Adjusting together is
        part of collaborative play.

> **Example**
> **Example – Sharing a Goal**
A player tells the GM between sessions, “I want my character’s missing mentor to matter this arc.” A few
>         sessions later, clues about the mentor’s fate appear in a side investigation. Because the player shared
>         that interest, the GM could weave it into existing plots rather than guessing what would land.

### Session Zero and Safety

Before a campaign begins, many groups hold a session zero to set expectations:

Use this time to talk about tone (cozy, gritty, heroic, horrific), the kinds of stories you want, and
        content that is off‑limits or should be handled gently. Agree on how you will pause or check in if
        something feels uncomfortable. A few minutes of honest conversation can prevent misunderstandings later.

Safety tools can be as simple as an agreement to pause and talk when someone feels uncomfortable, or as
        formal as a written set of lines and veils. The important part is that everyone feels they can speak up.

> **Example**
> **Example – Using a Safety Pause**
Midway through a tense interrogation, a player says, “Can we pause a second?” The table briefly steps out
>         of character and the player explains that a specific detail is hitting too close to home. The group and GM
>         adjust the scene—keeping the stakes, changing the flavor—and continue in a way that everyone can enjoy.

### Handling Disagreements

Disagreements will happen, both in character and out of character. To keep them from derailing play:

First, separate character conflict from player conflict. It is fine for characters to argue fiercely or
        make incompatible choices; it is not fine for players to feel attacked or sidelined. If a plan discussion
        stalls or tempers rise, step briefly out of character and ask, “What do we each want from this scene?”

If needed, the GM can frame the stakes and ask for a decision so the story can move: “If you split the
        party here, these risks apply; if you stay together, you miss this opportunity. Which do you prefer?”
        Once a choice is made, treat it as a shared direction and see where it leads.

> **Example**
> **Example – Resolving a Plan Disagreement**
Two players argue in character about whether to confront a faction now or gather more evidence. After a
>         few minutes, a third player says, “Let’s pause—what do we want as players?” They discover one wants a
>         tense confrontation, another wants to see more investigation scenes. Together with the GM, they decide to
>         stage a smaller confrontation that reveals new clues, giving both desires some space.

### Bringing It All Together

Roleplaying and collaboration are what turn mechanics into stories. Use the tools in this chapter to:

- Portray characters who change over time.
- Support one another’s arcs and share spotlight.
- Work with the GM to shape a campaign that reflects everyone’s interests and boundaries.

The rules in earlier chapters tell you how to resolve actions. This chapter is your reminder that how you
        choose those actions—and how you respond to the results—is just as important.
