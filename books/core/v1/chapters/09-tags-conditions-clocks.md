## 9. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive.
        They connect description to mechanics so that rain, fear, injuries, crowds, and looming deadlines all
        matter at the table. This chapter explains what each of these tools is for, how to use them, and how
        they interact with Checks.

### Tags vs. Conditions

**Tags**describe**the environment or situation**. They belong to places, scenes, objects, or
        circumstances:*Dim Light*,*Slick*,*Crowded*,*Fragile Cover*. Tags affect
        what you can do in a space and how you do it.

**Conditions**describe**your character's state**. They follow you from one location to the
        next until cleared:*Exhausted*,*Bleeding*,*Frightened*,*Restrained*.
        Conditions affect your actions wherever you go.

Tags and Conditions are the shared vocabulary the table uses to talk about advantages, risks, and
        lingering consequences. They are not extra subsystems to memorize. They are the names you give to
        things you are already describing.

### What Tags Do

A Tag is a short descriptor applied to a scene, location, object, or situation. It becomes a flag:
        “remember this when resolving actions here.” Tags typically:

- Grant Edge or Burden on certain Checks.
- Raise or lower DCs for specific actions.
- Change position or effect (how risky an action feels or how big its impact is).

You do not tag every detail. A room is just a room until its darkness, instability, crowd, or sacred
        significance matters to what characters are attempting. Tag the things that will shape decisions.

### Common Tag Categories

While Chapter 18 provides an extended reference, this chapter introduces three broad categories:

- **Environmental Tags**– Physical features of space:*Dim Light*,*Slick*,*Cramped*,*Elevated*,*Solid Cover*,*Fragile Cover*,*Unstable*.
- **Situational Tags**– Circumstances and pressures:*Crowded*,*Alert*,*Hazardous*,*Obscured*,*Surveillance*,*Networked*.
- **Atmospheric Tags**– Social or emotional tone:*Tense*,*Festive*,*Solemn*,*Suspicious*.

You can invent new Tags that fit your setting. The important part is agreeing at the table what a Tag
        does in practice: which actions it helps, which it hinders, and how it shapes consequences.

> **Example**
> **Example – Tags in a Warehouse Fight**
The GM describes a warehouse full of stacked crates, narrow aisles, and oil-spotted floors. They assign
>         the Tags*Cramped*,*Fragile Cover*, and*Slick*.
*Cramped*makes wide swings and large weapons awkward.*Fragile Cover*means wooden crates
>         can be shredded by fire, potentially stripping cover away.*Slick*imposes Burden on fast
>         movement or acrobatic maneuvers. Every decision in this scene now has texture.

### What Conditions Do

Conditions represent persistent states that modify what a character can safely attempt. They are the
        mechanical mark left by consequences. When something important happens to you—injury, fear, strain,
        affliction—it often becomes a Condition.

Conditions typically:

- Impose Burden on certain actions.
- Limit available options (cannot run, cannot act this turn, cannot speak clearly).
- Threaten further harm if ignored (ongoing damage, ticking Clocks).

### Examples of Common Conditions

A full alphabetical list appears in the Glossary. Here are a few you will see often:

- **Exhausted**– Burden on demanding physical actions until you rest or receive
          meaningful aid.
- **Bleeding**– Time pressure from an untreated wound. If not stabilized, it may tick a
          personal Clock or escalate to worse states.
- **Restrained**– You are held or pinned. You cannot move freely and must break free or
          be helped.
- **Dazed**– Disoriented; Burden on perception and reaction until you recover.
- **Frightened**– Burden on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when
          you rally, escape, or defeat the source.

> **Example**
> **Example – From Event to Condition**
A character fails a Check while crossing a compromised catwalk. Rather than simple damage, the GM
>         describes how they slam into the railing and twist their knee. They gain the Condition*Exhausted*or*Weakened*, representing reduced stamina. Future physical actions are harder
>         until they rest or receive treatment.

### Using Tags and Conditions with Checks

Tags and Conditions do not require new rules. They plug directly into the Check system:

- Tags often grant Edge or Burden on Checks that interact with them.
- Conditions usually impose Burden or limit which approaches are reasonable.
- Some Tags shift DCs or change position and effect instead of modifying dice directly.

When you are about to roll, quickly review which Tags and Conditions are relevant. Ask: “Does this make
        the action easier, harder, or riskier?” Then adjust Edge/Burden, DC, or consequences
        accordingly.

> **Example**
> **Example – Tag and Condition Interaction**
In a horror‑tinged mystery, a character stalks through a foggy graveyard at night. The scene has Tags*Dim Light*and*Obscured*. The character is also*Frightened*from a previous
>         encounter.
When they attempt to sneak past patrolling figures,*Dim Light*and*Obscured*might grant
>         Edge on Stealth, but*Frightened*could impose Burden on actions taken while the threat
>         is visible. The GM weighs these factors, cancels opposing modifiers as needed, and describes how the
>         character’s shaky nerves show up in the fiction.

### Introducing and Clearing Conditions

Conditions should follow naturally from events. A failed Check in a hazardous area might cause*Bleeding*or*Poisoned*. Exposure to overwhelming sights might cause*Frightened*.
        Pushing beyond safe limits might cause*Exhausted*.

When you introduce a Condition, state:

- What it represents in the fiction.
- How it affects actions (which Checks it modifies and how).
- How it can be cleared (time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock).

Minor Conditions should clear quickly once addressed. Major Conditions may persist across several scenes
        or form the basis for character‑driven goals.

### What Clocks Are

Clocks are segmented trackers that answer “how close are we?” for goals and threats. A Clock is a circle
        or track divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments. As actions succeed, time passes, or events occur, segments
        fill. When the Clock completes, something happens.

Use Clocks to represent:

- **Long‑term goals**– Research projects, faction plans, character endeavors.
- **Mounting threats**– Approaching storms, advancing enemies, spreading plagues.
- **Ticking dangers**– Rituals completing, bombs counting down, collapsing structures.
- **Faction projects**– Off‑screen activities of NPCs and organizations.

### Advancing Clocks

Clocks advance in several ways:

- **Success‑based**– Successful Checks tick a project Clock forward.
- **Time‑based**– Segments fill as scenes pass or as in‑world time moves.
- **Event‑based**– Specific narrative events advance background or faction Clocks.

Partial successes often advance a Clock and introduce a complication. Exceptional successes may jump a
        Clock by more than one segment. Failures might leave a Clock unchanged while pushing forward a related
        threat Clock.

> **Example**
> **Example – Investigation and Cover‑Up Clocks**
The group is investigating a corrupt official.

The GM creates an “Expose the Official” Clock with 6 segments and a “Cover‑Up” Clock with 4 segments.
        Successful RSN‑based investigation, social, or infiltration Checks advance the first Clock. Certain
        failures, loud approaches, or conspicuous visits advance the second. Which Clock fills first determines
        whether the truth comes out cleanly, is revealed with fallout, or is buried.

### Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

These tools are most powerful when used together:

- Tags set the stage: terrain, lighting, crowds, magical effects.
- Conditions show how previous events cling to characters and shape their options.
- Clocks track momentum toward outcomes that matter over time.

A single scene might involve a*Hazardous*Tag, characters who are*Exhausted*, and a
        “Structural Collapse” Clock. Every roll becomes a meaningful choice about risk, effort, and timing.

> **GM Guidance**
> **GM Guidance – Start Small**You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene. Start with one or two Tags that matter, a
>         few Conditions that arise naturally, and a single important Clock. Add more only when they clarify the
>         fiction rather than clutter it. When in doubt, ask: “Does this tool make the situation clearer and more
>         interesting?” If yes, use it.
