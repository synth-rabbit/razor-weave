## 8. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes

This chapter describes the core resolution engine of the game. Whenever a character takes an action and
        the outcome is uncertain, consequential, and within their reach to influence, the table may call for a
        Check. Checks turn intent and approach into dice, and dice back into story beats. Understanding how to
        call for, perform, and interpret Checks is essential for both players and the GM.

### When to Roll (and When Not To)

You roll when the GM calls for a Check. The GM should only do this when three conditions are all true:

- **Uncertainty**: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal
          conditions does not roll.
- **Consequence**: Failure or partial success would introduce tension, cost, or change. If failure just means
          “try again until it works,” do not roll.
- **Agency**: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Do not roll for things entirely outside
          the characters’ control.

If all three are present, a Check is appropriate. If one or more are missing, the GM either says “yes”
        and narrates success, or “no” and explains why it is impossible or out of scope. Checks are tools for
        focusing on interesting uncertainty, not a gate in front of every action.

> **Example**
> **Example – When to Roll**
*Trigger:*A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is
>         significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous.
*Assessment:*The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character’s choices
>         matter. The GM calls for a Check.
*Counter‑example:*The same character crossing a sturdy bridge in calm weather does not roll.
>         Success is assumed; the story moves forward.

### The Core Check Procedure

Every Check follows the same basic loop:

1. The player declares intent and approach.
1. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
1. If needed, the GM selects an Attribute and relevant Skill, sets a DC, and notes any Tags,
          Conditions, or Proficiencies that might grant Advantage or Disadvantage.
1. The player rolls**4d6**, applies modifiers, and compares the total to the DC.
1. The table interprets the outcome tier (critical success, full success, partial success, failure,
          critical failure) and updates the fiction accordingly.

### Declaring Intent and Approach

When you declare an action, you state two things:

- **Intent**: What you want to achieve in the fiction.
- **Approach**: How you are trying to achieve it.

Intent focuses the scene. Approach determines which Attribute, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and
        Conditions are relevant. The more concrete and grounded your description, the easier it is for the GM to
        set an appropriate DC and for the group to picture the moment.

> **Example**
> **Example – Intent and Approach**
*Intent:*“I want to get the factory foreman to delay shipment of the crates.”
*Approach:*“I speak with her in private, emphasize the safety risks, and show her evidence of the
>         faulty wiring we found.”
The GM recognizes this as a PRE‑based approach with a relevant social Skill and possibly a Proficiency
>         related to safety procedures or technical documentation.

### Setting DCs

The GM sets a**Difficulty Class (DC)**to represent how hard the task is under current circumstances. The
        system uses a standard ladder:

- **DC 12**– Easy
- **DC 14**– Routine
- **DC 16**– Tough
- **DC 18**– Hard
- **DC 20**– Heroic
- **DC 22**– Legendary

Start by imagining what success would look like in the scene and how far it is from effortless. Use
        lower DCs when characters have strong fictional positioning, good information, and safe conditions. Use
        higher DCs when time is short, the environment is hostile, or the task is at the edge of what is
        possible in the setting.

### Advantage, Disadvantage, Tags, and Conditions

Rather than constantly adjusting the DC, the game often represents favorable or unfavorable circumstances
        through**Advantage**and**Disadvantage**.

- **+1 Advantage**: Roll 5d6, keep the best 4.
- **+2 Advantage**: Roll 6d6, keep the best 4.
- **-1 Disadvantage**: Roll 5d6, keep the worst 4.
- **-2 Disadvantage**: Roll 6d6, keep the worst 4.

Advantage and Disadvantage usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies, or
        prior setup actions. They represent the table’s shared sense that the character is favored or hindered in
        this moment. Multiple sources combine into a single level of Advantage or Disadvantage and are capped at
        ±2—several small edges do not create infinite Advantage, and multiple problems do not push you below −2.
        If a character would have both Advantage and Disadvantage, reduce them against each other (for example,
        +2 and −1 becomes +1) until only one side remains, then apply the final level.

Tags and Conditions described in earlier chapters provide a shared vocabulary for these modifiers:*Dim Light*,*Slick*, or*Exposed*might impose Disadvantage;*Solid Cover*or*Marked*might grant Advantage in specific contexts or to specific parties.

### Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin

When a Check is called for, follow this procedure:

1. Roll**4d6**, adjusting the number of dice kept if Advantage or Disadvantage applies.
1. Add the relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects.
1. Compare the total to the DC to find the**margin**(Roll − DC).

The margin determines the outcome tier:

- **Critical Success**: Margin ≥ +5.
- **Full Success**: Margin ≥ 0.
- **Partial Success**: Margin −1 to −2.
- **Failure**: Margin ≤ −3.
- **Critical Failure**: Margin ≤ −7 or all 1s.

### Interpreting Outcomes

Every outcome tier should change the situation. The GM and players work together to describe what the
        dice mean in the fiction.

- **Critical Success**– You achieve more than you aimed for. Extra benefits, stronger
          position, or accelerated progress.
- **Full Success**– You get what you wanted with no significant cost. The scene moves
          forward cleanly.
- **Partial Success**– You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect.
          Momentum continues, tension rises.
- **Failure**– You do not achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Threats
          advance, resources strain, or positions worsen.
- **Critical Failure**– Things go significantly wrong. Use sparingly for dramatic beats:
          broken tools, dangerous exposure, or major escalations.

> **Example**
> **Example – Cross‑Genre Check**
*Trigger:*In a cozy town, a character tries to calm a panicked neighbor during a storm. In a
>         sci‑fi station, a character tries to reassure a frightened technician during a systems failure.
*Roll:*Both are PRE‑based Checks against DC 14 (Routine) with an appropriate social Skill. The
>         cozy scene might grant Advantage if the characters have a strong existing relationship.
*Consequence:*Full success calms the NPC and stabilizes the scene. Partial success calms them but
>         attaches a new obligation or rumor. Failure escalates the panic, spreading fear or misinformation.

### Group Checks and Assistance

Many actions involve more than one character. Rather than rolling for everyone separately every time, the
        GM can use:

- **Assistance**: One character leads the action, another assists. If the assistance is
          credible in the fiction, the leader gains Advantage or a small bonus.
- **Representative Checks**: One Check stands in for a coordinated group effort. The
          outcome tier describes how the whole group fares.
- **Split Risks**: Two or more characters each roll, and the GM focuses on the most
          interesting combination of results rather than tracking every detail.

Pick the method that best fits the moment. Use single rolls when you want quick resolution. Use
        individual rolls when it is important that different characters face different consequences.

### Checks and Clocks

Some obstacles are too big for a single Check. Instead, the GM creates a**Clock**with several segments.
        Successful Checks tick the Clock forward; failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks.

Use Clocks when:

- Characters are working toward a long‑term goal, such as investigating a mystery or repairing a ship.
- A danger is mounting over time, such as a collapsing tunnel, spreading fire, or advancing enemy force.
- Two or more forces are racing toward different outcomes (opposing Clocks).

> **Example**
> **Example – Clock and Checks**
*Trigger:*The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.
*Clocks:*“Evacuation Complete” (6 segments) and “Flood Waters Rise” (4 segments).
*Rolls:*Each scene, characters make MIG, AGI, PRE, or RSN Checks based on their chosen
>         contributions—lifting sandbags, coordinating crowds, analyzing routes. Successes advance the evacuation
>         clock; failures or partials tick the flood clock or create new complications.
*Outcome:*Which clock fills first determines whether the district is saved, partially saved, or
>         overwhelmed.

### Keeping Momentum

Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt:

- Use Partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action.
- Let Failures create new problems, reveal information, or shift the situation rather than blocking
          all paths.
- Allow retries only when the circumstances or approach meaningfully change.

The goal is not to punish characters for rolling poorly. The goal is to discover what happens next when
        risk meets intent. If the table keeps that in view, Checks will feel like natural beats in the story
        rather than interruptions.
