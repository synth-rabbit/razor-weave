## 10. Combat Basics

Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already
        learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical
        choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core
        combat actions to shape the fiction.

### Combat as a Scene

Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment‑to‑moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does
        not call for “initiative” the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know
        who acts in what order and how threats respond.

The table can always ask, “Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?” Use
        structured turns when:

- Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.
- Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.
- Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.

Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration.
        Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free
        narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate “combat mode.”

### Resolve Instead of Hit Points

The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close
        someone is to being taken out of a fight.

- **Resolve Clocks**track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC, or enemy can absorb
          before they are out of the scene.
- **Conditions**such as*Bleeding*,*Exhausted*, or*Stunned*mark
          lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.

When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your
        opponent’s Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse,
        depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.

#### Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?

Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:

- **Fiction first**– A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an
          arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at “0 HP.”
- **Visible progress**– A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone
          can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.
- **Flexible stakes**– Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or
          killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.
- **Pacing control**– The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick,
          cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.

Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and
        Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they
        become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and
        story rather than pure attrition.

> **Example**
> **Example – Enemy Resolve**
A dangerous VPC has a 6‑segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective
>         Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM
>         describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of
>         the fight in a way that fits the story.

Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being
        taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.

Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what “taken out” means in this scene. Are you
        trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes
        depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises
        about consequences.

### Turns and Order

Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach
        that fits the scene:

- **Conversational order**– The GM asks “Who acts next?” and rotates spotlight. Simple
          and flexible for small skirmishes.
- **Popcorn order**– After you resolve your turn, you choose who goes next. This keeps
          attention moving and avoids predictable patterns.
- **Initiative (optional)**– If the table prefers, you can use a simple initiative roll
          or fiction‑based ordering for more structure.

Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands
        who is up next.

> **Example**
> **Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order**
A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles
>         a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all
>         want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, “We’re in structured turns
>         now,” and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.

### Your Turn: Structure and Options

On your turn, you usually:

- Describe what you do in the fiction.
- Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).
- Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.

If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw
        a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters,
        it often fits into the same turn.

Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act
        and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they
        are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.

### Core Combat Actions

Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:

- **Strike**– Directly attack a target.
- **Maneuver**– Change position, create openings, or control space.
- **Set Up**– Create Advantage or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.
- **Defend / Withdraw**– Protect yourself or break contact to recover.

#### Strike

Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot,
        hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on
        your opponent’s awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.

On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial
        Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become*Exposed*, suffer a counterblow,
        or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your
        opponent a positional or narrative advantage.

Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against
        tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you
        commit to repeated Strikes.

#### Maneuver

Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an
        enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside
        a weapon.

Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can
        create*Prone*, strip*Solid Cover*, or apply a useful Tag such as*Exposed*that
        allies can exploit on later turns.

Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a
        doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a
        rope bridge. In sci‑fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single
        Strike.

#### Set Up

Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting
        to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you
        grant Advantage or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the
        opening but at some cost.

Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike
        chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Advantage you create.

As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher‑tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect
        the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better
        positions, cover, and Advantage, Strikes become dramatically more effective.

#### Defend / Withdraw

Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover,
        blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach
        a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition
        or yielding ground.

This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using
        Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or
        surviving to fight another day.

Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it,
        the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from “win here” to “escape, regroup, or change the
        stakes.” Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.

### Positioning and Environment

Tags play a major role in combat.*Dim Light*,*Cramped*,*Elevated*,*Fragile Cover*,*Slick*, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or
        change what is possible at all. Manege position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.

> **Example**
> **Example – Using the Battlefield**
In a rooftop fight marked as*Elevated*with scattered*Fragile Cover*, one character uses
>         Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting
>         Advantage on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats*Elevated*as granting Advantage on ranged attacks
>         from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.

### Conditions in Combat

Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being*Stunned*by a concussive blast,*Bleeding*after a severe hit, or*Suppressed*by incoming fire. These Conditions modify
        subsequent Checks and shape choices.

Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be
        cleared. For example,*Stunned*might end after you lose your next action, while*Exhausted*may persist until you rest between scenes.

Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both*Bleeding*and*Exhausted*is under pressure each round and rolling with Disadvantage on many actions. Scenes
        like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.

### Putting It Together

A typical combat turn might look like this:

1. The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.
1. You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.
1. The GM sets DC, notes any Advantage/Disadvantage, and clarifies stakes.
1. You roll**4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.
1. The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.

Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when
        Advantage and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions
        when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a
        series of disconnected attacks.

The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs,
        VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre‑flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep
        the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.
