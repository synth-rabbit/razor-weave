|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ≥ +5         | Critical Success  | Best‑case result, extra benefit            |
| ≥ 0          | Full Success      | Clear success, no major cost               |
| -1 to -2     | Partial Success   | Success with cost, complication, or limit  |
| ≤ -3         | Failure           | No success; situation changes or worsens   |
| ≤ -7 or all 1s | Critical Failure| Worst plausible result, big complications  |
