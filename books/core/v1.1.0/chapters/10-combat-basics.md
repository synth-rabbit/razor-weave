## 10. Combat Basics

Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core combat actions to shape the fiction.

### Combat as a Scene

Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does not call for "initiative" the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know who acts in what order and how threats respond.

The table can always ask, "Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?" Use structured turns when:

- Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.
- Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.
- Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.

Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration. Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate "combat mode."

### Resolve Instead of Hit Points

The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close someone is to being taken out of a fight.

- **Resolve Clocks** track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC (Vital Player Character—a significant NPC), or enemy can absorb before they are out of the scene.
- **Conditions** such as *Bleeding*, *Exhausted*, or *Stunned* mark lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.

When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your opponent's Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse, depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.

> **Why Resolve Clocks?**
>
> If you are coming from games with hit points, Resolve Clocks may feel unfamiliar. Here is why this system uses them:
>
> **Traditional HP:** A number that decreases. You ask "how many hit points left?" Combat becomes arithmetic—subtract damage, track totals, compare numbers.
>
> **Resolve Clocks:** Fictional pressure that increases. You ask "how close is this character to being taken out?" Combat becomes story—when do they falter, become desperate, finally break?
>
> | HP System | Resolve Clock System |
> |-----------|---------------------|
> | "The orc has 15 HP left" | "The orc's Clock is half full—he's getting desperate" |
> | "I deal 8 damage" | "Full Success on Strike—tick 2 segments" |
> | "He's at 0 HP, he dies" | "Clock fills—he flees, surrenders, or falls" |
> | Outcome is always depletion to zero | Outcome fits the stakes: defeat, capture, retreat |
> | Progress is hidden in numbers | Progress is visible: everyone sees the Clock filling |
>
> This keeps attention on narrative stakes rather than arithmetic, and lets different fights end in different ways.

#### Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?

Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:

- **Fiction first** – A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at "0 HP."
- **Visible progress** – A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.
- **Flexible stakes** – Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.
- **Pacing control** – The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick, cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.

Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and story rather than pure attrition.

> **Example – Enemy Resolve**
> A dangerous VPC has a 6-segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of the fight in a way that fits the story.

Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.

Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what "taken out" means in this scene. Are you trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises about consequences.

### Turns and Order

Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach that fits the scene.

> **Initiative Options Quick Reference**
>
> | Mode | How It Works | Best For |
> |------|--------------|----------|
> | **Conversational** | GM asks "Who acts next?" and rotates spotlight naturally | Small skirmishes, narrative focus, simple fights |
> | **Popcorn** | After resolving your turn, you choose who goes next (ally or enemy) | Dynamic fights, unpredictable flow, keeping everyone engaged |
> | **Rolled** | Each participant rolls AGI or relevant Check; act in order from highest to lowest | Tactical set-pieces, when precise timing matters, competitive scenarios |
>
> **GM Tip: Match Initiative to Scene Tone**
> - *Tense standoffs* → Conversational (builds suspense, allows negotiation)
> - *Chaotic melees* → Popcorn (captures confusion, surprises everyone)
> - *Tactical ambushes* → Rolled (rewards preparation, clear sequence)

Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands who is up next.

> **Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order**
> A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, "We're in structured turns now," and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.

### Your Turn: Structure and Options

On your turn, you usually:

- Describe what you do in the fiction.
- Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).
- Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.

If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters, it often fits into the same turn.

Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.

### Core Combat Actions

Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:

- **Strike** – Directly attack a target.
- **Maneuver** – Change position, create openings, or control space.
- **Set Up** – Create Edge or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.
- **Defend / Withdraw** – Protect yourself or break contact to recover.

#### Strike

Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot, hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on your opponent's awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.

On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become *Exposed*, suffer a counterblow, or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your opponent a positional or narrative advantage.

Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you commit to repeated Strikes.

#### Maneuver

Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside a weapon.

Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can create *Prone*, strip *Solid Cover*, or apply a useful Tag such as *Exposed* that allies can exploit on later turns.

Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a rope bridge. In sci-fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single Strike.

#### Set Up

Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you grant Edge or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the opening but at some cost.

Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Edge you create.

As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher-tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better positions, cover, and Edge, Strikes become dramatically more effective.

#### Defend / Withdraw

Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover, blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition or yielding ground.

This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or surviving to fight another day.

Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it, the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from "win here" to "escape, regroup, or change the stakes." Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.

### Positioning and Environment

Tags play a major role in combat. *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*, *Fragile Cover*, *Slick*, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or change what is possible at all. Manage position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.

> **Example – Using the Battlefield**
> In a rooftop fight marked as *Elevated* with scattered *Fragile Cover*, one character uses Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting Edge on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats *Elevated* as granting Edge on ranged attacks from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.

### Conditions in Combat

Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being *Stunned* by a concussive blast, *Bleeding* after a severe hit, or *Suppressed* by incoming fire. These Conditions modify subsequent Checks and shape choices.

Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be cleared. For example, *Stunned* might end after you lose your next action, while *Exhausted* may persist until you rest between scenes.

Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both *Bleeding* and *Exhausted* is under pressure each round and rolling with Burden on many actions. Scenes like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.

### Worked Combat Examples

These examples show complete combat sequences with Resolve Clock progression, demonstrating how the system flows in practice.

---

#### Example 1: The Tense Duel

**Setup:** Kira, a skilled duelist (AGI 2, Brawling Skill), faces Varro, a rival enforcer. Both have 4-segment Resolve Clocks. The scene is a rain-slicked courtyard (*Slick* Tag). Stakes: first to be taken out loses the dispute.

**Round 1 – Varro Strikes First**
- Varro lunges with his blade. AGI Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 17).
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 2 segments (now 2/4). She staggers back.
- *Fiction:* The blade catches her arm—a shallow cut but a solid hit.

**Round 2 – Kira Sets Up**
- Kira circles, watching his footwork, looking for a pattern. Set Up action.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 16 vs. DC 14).
- *Effect:* Kira gains Edge on her next Strike. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* She notices he overextends on his lunges—she can exploit that.

**Round 3 – Kira Strikes**
- Using her Edge, Kira feints low and strikes high. AGI Check with +1 Edge.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 21 with 5d6 keep 4).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock ticks 3 segments (now 3/4). He reels.
- *Fiction:* Her blade opens a gash on his shoulder. Blood mixes with rain.

**Round 4 – Varro Maneuvers Desperately**
- Desperate, Varro kicks at the slick ground, spraying water toward her eyes.
- *Result:* Partial Success (rolled 13 vs. DC 14, margin -1).
- *Effect:* Kira gains *Dazed* (Burden next round), but Varro is now *Exposed*.
- *Fiction:* Water stings her eyes, but his wild kick leaves him off-balance.

**Round 5 – Kira Finishes It**
- Despite being *Dazed* (Burden), Kira presses. He's *Exposed* (Edge cancels Burden).
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 15).
- *Effect:* Varro's Clock fills (4/4). He's taken out.
- *Fiction:* She drives him back against the fountain. His blade clatters away. He yields.

**Outcome:** Kira wins with 2/4 on her Clock. Varro is defeated but alive—he'll remember this.

#### Example 2: The Group Fight

**Setup:** Three PCs (Kira, Varn, Rella) face four bandits in a warehouse. Tags: *Cramped*, *Fragile Cover*, *Dim Light*. Bandits share a 6-segment group Resolve Clock. Each PC has a 4-segment Clock. Stakes: subdue or drive off the bandits.

**Round 1 – Bandits Attack**
- Two bandits rush Kira. GM rolls a group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Partial Success.
- *Effect:* Kira's Clock ticks 1 segment (1/4). She takes a glancing blow.
- Two bandits circle toward Varn and Rella but don't reach them yet.

**Round 2 – Kira Maneuvers**
- Kira shoves crates to create better cover for allies. MIG Check vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Allies now have *Solid Cover* against ranged attacks. No Clock advance.
- *Fiction:* Heavy crates screech across the floor, forming a barricade.

**Round 3 – Varn Sets Up**
- Varn calls out bandit positions and weak points. PRE-based Set Up vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Kira and Rella both gain Edge on their next actions.
- *Fiction:* "The big one favors his left leg—go for it!"

**Round 4 – Rella Strikes (with Edge)**
- Rella throws her lantern at the bandits' feet. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 16.
- *Result:* Full Success (rolled 18 with 5d6).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 2 segments (2/6). The area gains *Hazardous* Tag.
- *Fiction:* Oil splashes and ignites. Two bandits scramble back, singed.

**Round 5 – Bandits Retaliate**
- Remaining bandits attack Rella (nearest threat). Group Strike vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Failure (rolled 11).
- *Effect:* No Clock advance on Rella. She ducks behind cover.
- *Fiction:* Clubs swing wide as Rella drops flat.

**Round 6 – Kira Strikes (with Edge from Round 3)**
- Kira charges the big bandit, targeting his weak leg. AGI Check with +1 Edge vs. DC 14.
- *Result:* Critical Success (rolled 20).
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock ticks 3 segments (5/6). The big one goes down.
- *Fiction:* Her blade sweeps his leg. He crashes into crates and doesn't get up.

**Round 7 – Varn Negotiates**
- With their leader down, Varn calls for surrender. PRE Check vs. DC 12 (lowered—they're losing).
- *Result:* Full Success.
- *Effect:* Bandit Clock fills (6/6). They surrender.
- *Fiction:* "It's over! Drop your weapons or burn with the warehouse!"

**Outcome:** Bandits subdued. Kira has 1/4 on her Clock. No one else was seriously hurt. The *Hazardous* fire must be dealt with, but the fight is won.

### Putting It Together

A typical combat turn might look like this:

1. The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.
1. You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.
1. The GM sets DC, notes any Edge/Burden, and clarifies stakes.
1. You roll **4d6**, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.
1. The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.

Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when Edge and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a series of disconnected attacks.

The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs, VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre-flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.

### Chapter Summary

Combat uses the same Check system as other scenes, focused through Resolve Clocks, core combat actions (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw), and environmental Tags. Choose an initiative mode that fits the scene tone. Use the Resolve Clock comparison to understand why this system tracks pressure rather than hit points. The worked examples show how Clocks, Tags, and actions combine into dynamic fights with meaningful stakes.
