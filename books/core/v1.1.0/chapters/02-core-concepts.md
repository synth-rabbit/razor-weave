## 2. Core Concepts at a Glance

This chapter introduces the most important ideas in the system in a compact form. Later chapters expand
        and refine them, but everything begins here. You can return to these concepts whenever you need to realign
        on how the game is meant to feel at the table.

### Fiction First

The story is always the starting point. You begin by understanding the situation, describing what the
        characters do, and only then reaching for rules if the outcome is uncertain and meaningful. You do not
        start with a rule and then try to force the fiction to match it.

### Characters

Characters are the main lens through which you experience the world. They are defined by four Attributes
        (Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Presence (PRE), Reason (RSN)), a small set of Skills, a focused group of Proficiencies, and the
        choices they make. Characters also have histories, goals, and unresolved threads that tie them to the
        world.

### Checks and Outcomes

A Check is the system's way of resolving uncertainty when the stakes matter. When you make a Check, you
        use an Attribute, a Skill, and the shared fiction to determine what is at risk. The result produces an
        outcome tier, which becomes the next beat in the story. Success, partial success, and failure are all
        ways for the story to move forward.

### Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

Tags and Conditions are short descriptors that shape how the world and characters behave. Tags are applied
        to scenes, locations, or situations. Conditions are ongoing states on characters. Clocks are visual
        trackers of danger, opportunity, or change. Together they help the table feel the weight of time and
        consequence.

### Table Collaboration

The system assumes that everyone at the table contributes to the story. The GM presents the world
        honestly. Players act through their characters with clear intent and approach. The rules help resolve
        what happens when those actions encounter uncertainty or resistance.

You can begin play after reading Chapters 1 through 6. The rest of the book deepens and extends the core
        ideas as your table needs them.
