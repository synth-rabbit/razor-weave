# Chapter 28: Glossary

Comprehensive definitions of game terms and concepts

## Core Mechanics

**Edge**Roll extra dice and keep best 4. Comes in two levels: +1 Edge (roll 5d6, keep best 4) or +2 Edge (roll 6d6, keep best 4). Granted by favorable positioning, gear, assistance, or special abilities. Cannot stack beyond ±2 levels.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Edge and Burden

**Clock**Progress tracker with segments. Tick forward on successes (Progress Clock) or escalate pressure (Pressure Clock).

Defined in:Chapter 8: Checks and Clocks

**Condition**Character status effect (Exhausted, Bleeding, Restrained). Impose mechanical penalties or narrative limits.

Defined in:Chapter 9: Tags vs. Conditions

**Critical Failure**Margin ≤-7 or all 1s rolled. Disaster occurs; worst possible result with major complication.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Outcome Tiers

**Critical Success**Margin ≥+5. Succeed spectacularly with extra benefit or bonus effect.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Outcome Tiers

**Difficulty Class (DC)**Target number for checks. Ranges from DC 12 (Easy) to DC 22 (Legendary). Standard ladder: 12/14/16/18/20/22.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Setting DCs

**Burden**Roll extra dice and keep worst 4. Comes in two levels: -1 Burden (roll 5d6, keep worst 4) or -2 Burden (roll 6d6, keep worst 4). Imposed by poor positioning, conditions, obstacles, or penalties. Cannot stack beyond ±2 levels.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Edge and Burden

**Failure**Margin ≤-3. Goal not achieved; situation escalates or new complication emerges.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Outcome Tiers

**Full Success**Margin ≥0. Achieve goal cleanly; tick progress, gain position.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Outcome Tiers

**Margin**Difference between roll total and DC (Roll - DC). Determines outcome tier.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Calculating Margin

**Partial Success**Margin -1 to -2. Achieve goal with cost, complication, or reduced effect.

Defined in:Chapter 8: Outcome Tiers

Defined in:Chapter 5: Group Play With a GM

**VPC (Villain/Powerful Character)**Major antagonist with advanced mechanics. VPCs are significant threats that use special rules to provide challenging and memorable encounters as primary adversaries.

Defined in:Chapter 24: NPCs and VPCs Defined

## Common Conditions

**Bleeding**Time pressure; condition worsens if not treated. An active wound that will worsen without treatment. Usually paired with a short Clock such as "Stabilize Wound" or requires field treatment or medical attention to clear.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Dazed**Disoriented; Burden on perception and reaction. Cleared after one turn or aid. You're struggling to focus and process what's happening around you.

Defined in:Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Exhausted**Reduce effectiveness until rest or aid. Burden on physical actions. Deep fatigue from sustained effort, lack of rest, or stress. Burden on demanding physical actions and Checks using MIG or AGI approaches; clears with meaningful rest or care.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Exposed**Vulnerable; Burden to defense. Clear by moving to cover or breaking line of sight. You're out in the open or otherwise vulnerable to attack.

Defined in:Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Frightened**Burden on actions while threat is visible. Clear by removing threat or rallying. Overwhelming fear tied to a specific threat or situation; clears by escaping, rallying, or confronting the cause.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Marked**Tracked or targeted; opponent gains Edge against you. Clear by breaking contact. Specifically targeted or tracked by a foe until the mark is removed (breaking line of sight, changing appearance, or defeating the threat).

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Poisoned**Ongoing damage or Burden; duration varies. Clear via antidote or medical aid. Exposed to harmful substances that impair or injure; may inflict periodic damage or tick a "Toxin Spreads" Clock.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Prone**You're lying on the ground. Movement limited and vulnerable to some attacks while protected from others. Typically requires an action or movement to stand up.

Defined in:Chapter 10: Combat Basics

**Restrained**Movement limited by bonds, grapple, or obstacle. Clear via help, time, or leverage. Held, tied, pinned, or otherwise unable to move freely. Cannot change position or perform many physical actions.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Stunned**Can't act next turn. Cleared automatically after one turn. A severe condition that prevents actions and movement, making you extremely vulnerable.

Defined in:Chapter 9: Tags, Conditions, and Clocks

**Suppressed**Burden on next action due to pressure or intimidation. Cleared after acting. Shaken confidence, intimidation, or social pressure; usually clears after one meaningful attempt or supportive roleplaying.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

## Common Tags

**Area**This attack or effect targets everyone in a defined zone (Close range burst, Far range cone, etc.). Allies and enemies alike are affected unless the description specifies otherwise. Area effects are powerful but indiscriminate.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Cramped**Hinders movement; increases fall risk; limits large weapons or sweeping actions. Tight corridors, low ceilings, or packed spaces. Burden on actions that need space (large weapons, sweeping attacks); may grant Edge when bracing or grappling.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Crowded**Edge to blend in or lose pursuit; Burden to chase or spot targets. Many people sharing a small space such as markets, rallies, or evacuation queues. Harder to move quickly or track a single person; easier to blend in or lose a tail.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Dim Light**Edge to stealth; Burden to ranged attacks and detailed observation. Shadows, poor lighting, or night conditions provide cover for sneaking but make it harder to see clearly or aim precisely.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Elevated**Edge on ranged attacks; forces opponents to climb or find alternate routes. Higher ground, vantage points, or raised platforms provide tactical superiority. Movement to or from elevation may require Checks.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Forceful**On a hit, you can push the target one range band away from you (Close to Far, Far to Distant). The target must be roughly your size or smaller. This forced movement happens before any other effects resolve.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Fragile Cover**Grants Edge to defense but degrades on Partial Success or repeated use. Barriers that can be destroyed—thin walls, wooden crates, glass partitions. Edge on defense until damaged; repeated hits may destroy cover and create new hazards.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Hazardous**Environmental danger (fire, acid, collapsing floor); risk of damage or conditions. Meaningful risk of harm from the environment or situation. Partial Successes and Failures may inflict Conditions, tick threat Clocks, or escalate danger.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Messy**This weapon or attack is brutal, loud, and obvious. It leaves evidence (blood, property damage, noise). Great for intimidation; terrible for subtlety. Messy attacks draw attention.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Obscured**Vision blocked (fog, smoke, darkness); Burden to ranged attacks and navigation. Fog, smoke, heavy rain, or cluttered sightlines severely limit visibility. Burden on sight-based Perception; may grant Edge to ambushes and escapes.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Precise**You can target specific body parts, objects, or weak points. On a Full Success or better, you can inflict a specific condition (disarm, blind, etc.) instead of dealing damage. The GM determines what's possible based on the situation.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Slick**Burden on movement and maneuvers requiring balance (ice, oil, wet stone). Wet stone, oil, ice, or unstable footing makes movement treacherous. Failures may inflict Conditions or create new Tags.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Solid Cover**Reliable protection; grants Edge to defense without degrading. Reliable barriers—stone walls, heavy crates, reinforced barricades. May block some attacks entirely unless flanked or bypassed.

Defined in:Chapter 18: Extended Tags & Conditions Reference

**Unstable**Risk of collapse, shifting terrain, or loss of footing; movement requires checks. Rattling catwalks, loose stones, precarious stacks. Checks that move or add weight risk advancing Clocks or causing falls; Failures often make the environment worse.
