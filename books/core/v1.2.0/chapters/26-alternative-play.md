## 26. Alternative Play

While the game is written with a Game Master in mind, you can also play without a single GM or with shared
        authority. You can even combine shared authority with solo or small‑party play by leaning on Virtual Player
        Characters (VPCs) from Chapter 24. This chapter offers principles and procedures for those modes while
        keeping the core 4d6 system, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks intact.

### Principles of Shared Authority

In GMless or shared authority play, the table distributes responsibilities that a single GM would normally
        carry. To keep the game coherent and fair, begin by clarifying roles. Decide who tracks Clocks, who keeps an
        eye on rules, and who speaks for which factions or major NPCs. These assignments can rotate, but everyone
        should know who is doing what in the current session.

Use open, shared notes for Tags, fronts, and outstanding questions. A simple shared document or visible
        sheet on the table helps everyone remember which fronts are active, which Clocks are close to completion,
        and what loose ends still matter. Favor transparency: make DCs, Clocks, and major fronts visible to
        everyone, so the group can judge risks and consequences together.

### Rotating Facilitator

One simple form of shared authority is the rotating facilitator. Each session, one player takes on a light
        GM role: framing scenes, presenting problems, and helping adjudicate rules. Other players still contribute
        ideas and may take over certain responsibilities.

Rotate the facilitator role regularly—every session or every arc—so no one person carries the job all the
        time. Let the facilitator focus on big‑picture framing and pacing while others handle certain NPCs or
        factions. In these modes, safety tools and calibration from Chapter 20 become even more important, because
        everyone shares some part of the authority that a single GM would normally hold.

> **Example**
> **Example – Rotating Facilitator**
In a political drama campaign, each player takes a turn framing sessions about their character’s home
>         faction. When it is your turn, you introduce new complications for your faction and ask questions about how
>         others respond, but everyone shares in describing outcomes and consequences.

### GMless Procedures

Fully GMless play works best when procedures are explicit. Agree on how you will introduce threats, decide
        outcomes, and keep the fiction coherent.

Many groups like to use a simple turn structure for scene framing. On your turn, you frame a scene, invite
        others to act, and help adjudicate any Checks that arise. When a question about the world comes up and no
        one has a strong opinion, discuss briefly and then choose the most interesting answer that still respects
        established Tags and fronts. If you are still unsure, or you want to surprise yourselves, use oracles or
        random tables (such as “Yes/No/Complication” prompts) to resolve uncertain world questions.

Even without a GM, someone should still be responsible for tracking Clocks, Tags, and Conditions. You can

### Solo Play with VPC Companions

Solo play focuses on a single protagonist and your own choices as both player and facilitator. VPCs make
        solo play feel like a full party game by adding mechanical support and in‑fiction companions without taking
        control away from you. This section provides a framework for using the core system to tell solo stories with
        VPCs while preserving uncertainty and surprise.

#### Solo Play Principles

Solo play emphasizes introspection, discovery, and personal pacing. You decide when to zoom in on a moment
        and when to jump ahead. The same fiction‑first structure applies: establish the situation and what your
        character wants, ask whether the outcome is uncertain and meaningful, and call for Checks only when both are
        true. VPCs travel alongside you, but they react to your choices rather than driving the story themselves.

When building a solo party, create one or two VPCs that clearly cover gaps in your own character’s Skills
        and Proficiencies. If you are playing a social investigator, you might add a physically capable VPC and a
        technical expert. Keep their concepts simple and their motivations aligned with yours so that you are never
        debating against yourself about what the group “should” do.

#### Using Oracles and Prompts

Without another person at the table, you can use oracles, random tables, or written prompts to stand in for
        a GM. These tools answer questions about how the world responds to your actions and those of your VPC
        companions. When you do not know how an NPC reacts or whether a rumor is true, roll on a simple
        “Yes / No / Complication” oracle and interpret the result in light of existing Tags and Clocks.

You can also create short tables for genre‑specific twists—mysterious clues, faction moves, strange weather,
        uncanny phenomena. Clocks are especially useful in solo play for tracking longer mysteries or threats that
        evolve regardless of your immediate focus. When you spend several scenes on personal matters or travel,
        advance a relevant Clock to show how the wider world is changing in your absence.

> **Example**
> **Example – Solo Oracle**
You wonder if the abandoned station still has power. You decide the base chance is “unlikely.” You roll on a
>         small oracle table and get “Yes, but…”. The lights flicker on (Tag:*Unstable Power*), but a*Security Systems Wake*Clock also starts at 1 of 6. Your VPC companion, a cautious engineer, urges
>         you to move quickly before systems cycle fully online.

#### Journaling and Record‑Keeping

Keeping a record of solo play makes it easier to track Tags, Conditions, and Clocks over many sessions.
        You can use the Session Log and Advancement Tracker sheets from Chapter 28 or your own journal. Briefly note
        each scene, any Checks that mattered, and how VPCs contributed so that their growth feels consistent.

Between sessions, update Clocks, fronts, and important Tags as they change. Mark down questions you want to
        explore next time: unresolved clues, VPC worries, or threads you are curious about. Solo play benefits from
        this written memory, especially when you are juggling both protagonist and facilitator roles.

#### Bringing Solo Stories to the Table

Solo play can exist alongside group play. You might explore a character’s side journeys alone, travelling
        with one or two VPCs, and then rejoin a group campaign later. When you do, share a summary of solo events
        with the group and the GM, and translate key outcomes into Tags, Conditions, and advancement choices that
        everyone can see.

Work with the GM and the rest of the table to integrate any new fronts, NPCs, or VPC developments that
        emerged from solo sessions. This keeps the whole campaign consistent while honoring the personal stories you
        told on your own, and it lets your VPC companions feel like part of the shared world instead of isolated
        side characters.
