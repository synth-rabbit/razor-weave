## 3. How to Use This Rulebook

This chapter explains how to navigate the Core Rulebook, how to understand the structure of the system,
        and how to use the text at the table. You do not need to memorize everything before you begin play. The
        book is designed so that you can learn the basics, then return to specific chapters as questions arise.

### Navigating the Book

The Core Rulebook is organized to support both reading and quick reference. The structure is:

- **Chapters 1 through 5**introduce the game, the core concepts, how to use the book, the principles of play, and the different ways to play.
- **Chapters 6 through 13**present the core rules that players will use most often at the table, including character creation, attributes, and core resolution.
- **Chapters 14 through 17**provide the full Skills and Proficiencies references.
- **Chapters 18 through 20**collect key mechanical references such as Tags, Conditions, and advancement.
- **Chapters 21 through 26**give the Game Master tools for running scenes, campaigns, and alternative modes of play.
- **Chapters 28 and 29**provide the glossary and index.

If you are new to tabletop roleplaying, it is helpful to read Chapters 1 through 5 in order. If you
        already have experience, you can skim the early chapters, then focus on Chapters 6 and 7, where the
        core resolution and character structure are introduced in detail.

### Rules as Tools

The rules in this book are tools. They help the table answer the question of what happens next. You do
        not exist to serve the rules. The rules exist to support your story. When a rule clarifies a moment, use
        it. When a rule does not add anything useful, resolve the situation through conversation instead. The
        game is at its best when the rules and the fiction work together.

The system is built around a single resolution structure. Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks all connect to this structure. Once you understand how Checks work, the rest of
        the mechanics will feel familiar and consistent.

> **Example**
> **Example**The group reaches a sealed laboratory door. The GM describes the control panel and the faint glow
>         of backup power. The players discuss how their characters might open it. No one grabs dice yet. The
>         table first decides whether the action is risky and meaningful. Only then do the rules become
>         necessary.

### What a Rule Explains

Every major rule in this book answers three questions. What does this rule cover. When does it
        apply. How does it influence the fiction. These three ideas appear in the way chapters are written
        and in the examples that follow them. If a rule feels confusing, return to these questions. They
        usually point to the intended use.

### Fiction First Structure

The rules always follow the fiction. You begin by understanding the situation, the environment, and
        the characters. You describe what is happening in the story. Only when the outcome of an action is
        uncertain and meaningful do you reach for mechanics. You do not start with a rule and then try to
        force the fiction to match it.

### Checks in Context

Checks are the system's way of resolving uncertainty. Later chapters explain the procedure in
        detail. This chapter focuses on how to think about Checks as you read. A Check is a signal that the
        scene has reached a point where chance and consequence matter. When a Check is called for, the
        chapter you are reading will explain exactly which part of the system is in focus.

### Learning the Flow of the System

The system has a flow that you will learn over time. You do not need to master everything at once.
        Instead, you can approach the book in layers. First, read enough to understand the core loop. Then,
        as your group encounters new situations, you can read or reread the chapters that support those
        scenes.

### Intent and Approach in the Text

As you read rule examples, notice how often the words intent and approach appear. They are used
        deliberately. Intent describes what the character wants to achieve. Approach describes how the
        character is trying to achieve it. Many examples in this book use that pairing to show why certain
        Attributes, Skills, or Proficiencies apply.

### Recognizing Rule Triggers

Not every scene needs mechanical resolution. One of the skills you develop as you read and play is
        the ability to recognize which moments call for specific rules. When the story reaches a point where
        uncertainty and consequence align, a rule triggers. A chapter might say that a certain kind of
        situation often triggers a Check, or that a specific type of danger often advances a Clock.

### Using Examples

Examples appear throughout this book to demonstrate the rules in action. They follow a consistent
        pattern. The scene is described. A player states intent and approach. The GM decides whether a Check
        is needed. Dice are rolled. The outcome changes the situation. The example then shows how that
        change affects the next moment of the story.

### Using the Glossary

The glossary at the end of the book is the authoritative source for terms. When a word has a
        glossary definition, it will appear with a link the first time it is used in a chapter. If you are
        uncertain about the meaning of a term, check the glossary entry. It often clears up confusion that
        might arise from casual reading.

### Reading as a Group

Many groups benefit from reading the early chapters together. A session zero that includes a shared
        read through of the welcome, core concepts, and principles of play chapters helps everyone align on
        tone and expectations. Chapter 5, Ways to Play the Game, is also useful to read as a group so that
        everyone understands which play style you are aiming for.

### Chapter Summary

This chapter has given you a lens for reading the rest of the book. Treat the rules as tools that
        support your story. Let the fiction guide when mechanics come into play. Use examples and the
        glossary to deepen your understanding. Move at a pace that feels comfortable. The next chapter
        introduces the core principles of play that shape every session at your table.
