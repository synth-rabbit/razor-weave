# Vagrant Stars

## Core Concept

Space western set after the collapse of Shattered Stars' great empires and councils. The grand civilizations fell decades ago, leaving independent colonies, frontier settlements, and scrappy crews surviving in the aftermath. Inspired by Cowboy Bebop's jazzy melancholy, Firefly's found family, and Outlaw Star's adventure, Vagrant Stars follows rogues, bounty hunters, smugglers, and wanderers making their way in a universe that forgot about them.

Players are typically crew of independent starship - maybe Firefly-style freighter, bounty hunter ship, or ramshackle explorer - taking whatever jobs pay while trying to outrun their pasts. The frontier is beautiful and dangerous, freedom is hard-won, and tomorrow is never guaranteed. But you've got your ship, your crew, and one more job might be the big score. Probably won't be, but maybe.

## Tone & Themes

**Melancholy freedom with bursts of hope.** The tone is bittersweet: empires fell, millions died, civilization fragmented, but survivors found liberty in the ruins. Themes include found family, the weight of the past, making your own way, whether home is place or people, and beauty in impermanence.

Inspired by Cowboy Bebop's "tomorrow never knows" philosophy, jazz soundtracks, and episodic structure. Firefly's scrappy optimism and crew loyalty. Outlaw Star's sense of adventure. Characters have tragic backstories but face forward. Some episodes are heists, some are quiet character moments, some are wrestling with past.

## What Makes It Unique

**Post-collapse of Shattered Stars** - Directly connected to previous setting. The Empire crumbled, Council dissolved, factions destroyed each other. Now it's frontier survival. References to the old powers haunt the present.

**Episodic structure encouraged** - Unlike campaign-arc settings, Vagrant Stars embraces episodic play. Each session can be standalone job that happens to same crew. Character development occurs through small moments rather than grand arcs (though those are possible too).

**Frontier focus** - Not centers of power but edges of civilization. Struggling colonies, mining operations, space stations as truck stops, backwater planets. Where empires don't reach and authorities don't care.

**Ship as home** - Firefly made ship a character; Vagrant Stars follows that. Players' ship isn't just transportation but sanctuary, identity, and family gathering place. Customize it, repair it, love it, almost lose it.

**Jazz-age-in-space aesthetic** - Bebop's fusion of jazz, film noir, westerns, and sci-fi. Music matters, style matters, cool matters. Not grim survive-at-any-cost but stylish desperation.

## Key Locations

**The Belt** - Asteroid field between former empire core and outer colonies. Mining operations, hidden bases, smuggler havens, and debris from war. Lawless and profitable for those willing to risk it.

**Frontier Colonies** - Struggling settlements on edge of known space. Ranching planets, agricultural domes, mining outposts. Need everything, afford little, welcome anyone with useful skills.

**Free Stations** - Independent space stations serving as trade hubs, refueling stops, and neutral ground. Like Old West towns in space. Some reputable, others wretched hives.

**The Scrapyards** - Orbiting graveyards of destroyed fleet from final war. Salvagers strip derelicts for parts and treasure. Dangerous (unexploded ordnance, hull breaches, ghosts of past).

**Bounty Boards** - Physical or digital locations where contracts are posted. Bounty hunters check these religiously. Rewards range from petty criminals to war criminals to rescue missions.

**The Red Mile** - Frontier "pleasure district" spanning multiple stations and planets. Gambling, entertainment, vice. Morally questionable but culturally vibrant. Always something happening here.

**Old Earth (and other homeworlds)** - Original species homeworlds still exist but are shadows of former glory. Some visit for nostalgia; others fled and never looked back.

**The Deep Black** - Unexplored space beyond the frontier. Ancient mysteries, lost colonies, new discoveries. For adventurers with nothing to lose.

## Major Factions

**Independent Colonies** - Hundreds of frontier settlements governing themselves. From democratic to dictatorial, prosperous to desperate. Each has different needs and problems. Primary source of jobs.

**The Guilds** - Professional organizations maintaining standards: Bounty Hunter Guild, Salvagers Union, Merchant League, Pilots Association. Provide legitimacy and support in lawless times.

**Remnant Warlords** - Former military officers who carved out petty kingdoms from empire's corpse. Control systems through force. Hire mercenaries, pirates, and desperate crews.

**Corporate Holdouts** - Megacorps that survived collapse by abandoning failing systems and consolidating. Still powerful in limited areas. Hire troubleshooters for problems they can't handle officially.

**Pirate Syndicates** - Organized criminal operations preying on weak colonies and trade routes. Some honorable (code-bound privateers), most aren't.

**The Drifters** - No faction but cultural force: crews like players moving between jobs, places, identities. Shared culture of survival, freedom, and skepticism of authority.

**Remembrance Orders** - Groups trying to preserve knowledge and culture from before collapse. Libraries, museums, archives. Hire protection for expeditions to recover artifacts.

**New Powers** - Colonies and alliances slowly forming new governance structures. Whether they'll make same mistakes as predecessors or build better remains to be seen.

## Central Conflicts

**Day-to-day survival** - Ship needs fuel, crew needs food, both cost money. Take jobs even if questionable. Balancing ideals with necessity constant challenge.

**The past catches up** - Everyone has history. Old enemies resurface, debts come due, crimes catch attention, loved ones make demands. Can't outrun past forever but you can try.

**Frontier lawlessness** - Weak government means both freedom and vulnerability. Pirates, warlords, corporate exploitation. Protecting yourself and those you care about is personal responsibility.

**Moral choices** - Take bounty on person who might be innocent? Smuggle cargo without asking what's inside? Help colony that can't pay? Every job has ethical dimension.

**Warlord expansion** - Some remnant powers try rebuilding empire. Threaten colonies, draft crews, extort resources. Resist, flee, or accommodate?

**Finding home** - Wandering is romantic until lonely. Building connections while maintaining freedom. Is ship enough or need planet to call home? Can crew be family or always temporary?

**The big score** - Every crew dreams of one job paying enough to retire. Opportunities appear (always too good to be true). Resist temptation or risk everything?

**Making meaning** - In universe that forgot you exist, what matters? Helping others? Personal freedom? Seeking answers? Finding love? Players define purpose through actions.

## Potential Adventures

**The First Job** - Crew comes together (or meets new member) for simple cargo run. Goes wrong predictably, introducing them to each other and frontier's dangers. Bebop-style formation episode.

**Bounty of the Week** - Classic episodic structure: hunting bounty leads to complications. Target is sympathetic, competition is deadly, or truth isn't what contract claimed. Moral choices ensue.

**Ghost Ship** - Distress call from derelict in scrapyard. Investigate to find valuable salvage, horrifying discovery, or both. Ship has story; telling it is dangerous.

**The Old Crew** - Someone from player's past appears needing help. Old flame, former comrade, mentor, enemy - relationship is complicated. Job drags crew into personal history.

**Colony Defense** - Frontier settlement facing pirate raids or warlord annexation. Hire players for defense. Seven Samurai structure: prepare defenses, know you're outgunned, fight anyway because it's right.

**The Big Score** - Rumor of pre-collapse treasure/technology. Competition is fierce, danger is worse, payoff is potentially life-changing. Classic heist structure with space western flavor.

**Tomorrow Never Knows** - Campaign finale allowing multiple endings: crew splits up or stays together, finds home or keeps drifting, settles old scores or makes peace with past. Their story reaches conclusion (or new chapter) on their terms.
