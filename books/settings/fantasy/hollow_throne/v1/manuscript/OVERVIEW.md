# Hollow Throne

## Core Concept

Grimdark sword and sorcery in a dying world where magic is powerful but corrupting, ancient empires crumble into dust, and survival means making terrible choices. Inspired by Conan the Barbarian, Berserk, and Elric of Melniboné, Hollow Throne is a setting where civilization decays, gods are cruel or absent, and the strong take what they can while the weak suffer. Players are mercenaries, treasure hunters, exiles, and survivors carving out existence in a world slouching toward oblivion.

Magic exists but demands terrible prices - sanity, soul, or life itself. The great kingdoms are hollow shells maintained by increasingly desperate rulers. Cosmic forces beyond comprehension feast on reality's dying energies. There are no chosen ones coming to save the world. There is only you, your blade, and your will to survive one more day.

## Tone & Themes

**Brutal, nihilistic, but defiantly human.** The tone is dark without being hopeless - heroes may not save the world, but they can save each other, or die trying. Themes include the corrupting nature of power, survival vs. morality, the price of knowledge, strength in the face of futility, and fleeting beauty in a doomed world.

Inspired by Conan's "civilization is corrupt, barbarism is honest," Berserk's cosmic horror and relentless struggle, and Elric's tragic relationship with soul-devouring power. Violence is common but meaningful. Death is permanent and close. Small victories matter because they're all you'll get.

## What Makes It Unique

**Dying world with cosmic dread** - Not post-apocalyptic but pre-apocalyptic; the world is actively dying. Magic that once sustained empires now consumes them. Reality frays at the edges as incomprehensible entities gnaw at creation. Resources dwindle, knowledge is lost, and each generation is weaker than the last.

**Magic as Faustian bargain** - Sorcery is powerful but requires sacrifices: blood, memories, years of life, fragments of soul, sanity. The mightiest sorcerers are broken things, barely human. Divine magic requires serving cruel gods with terrible demands. Even "good" magic has costs.

**Morally gray pragmatism** - No clear good guys. Kingdoms are oppressive, rebels are brutal, merchants exploit, and heroes do what they must. Players make hard choices: betray the innocent to survive? Use corrupting magic to save a friend? Serve evil master to eat?

**Decadent empires** - Once-great civilizations maintain facades of glory while rotting from within. Emperors dabble in forbidden magic to extend lives, nobles feast while peasants starve, and ancient traditions become empty ritual. Elric's Melniboné mixed with Berserk's Midland.

## Key Locations

**The Ashen Empire** - Largest remaining kingdom, ruled by undying Empress who sustains herself through dark sorcery. Capital is magnificent and horrible - golden spires above, torture chambers below. Decadent and paranoid.

**The Broken Reach** - Frontier badlands where failed states dissolve into warlord territories. Mercenaries, bandits, refugees, and treasure hunters compete for scraps. Lawless but honest about it.

**The Sunken Cities** - Coastal metropolises slowly claimed by rising seas. Ancient libraries flood, desperate scholars salvage knowledge, cults worship drowned gods. Beautiful decay.

**The Last Oasis** - Fertile valley protected by weakening ward-stones. Refugees flood in; resources stretch thin. How long before paradise becomes another hellscape?

**The Howling Wastes** - Desert of black sand where reality is thin. Demons wander freely, lost cities emerge and vanish, time flows wrong. Treasures and madness await.

**The God-Corpse Mountains** - Petrified body of dead god forming mountain range. Divine essence leaks from wounds, creating both miracles and abominations. Pilgrims and scavengers alike seek power.

**The Throne itself** - Legendary seat of power at world's heart, said to grant dominion over reality. Every conqueror who claimed it went mad. Most believe it doesn't exist; some search anyway.

## Major Factions

**The Ashen Court** - Empress and her decadent nobles, sustained by blood magic and slave labor. Powerful but paranoid, crushing threats real and imagined.

**Sorcerer Cabals** - Mages who banded together for protection and knowledge-sharing. Each cabal has different philosophy on magic's costs; all are dangerous.

**The Mercenary Companies** - Professional soldiers selling blades to highest bidder. Some maintain codes of honor; others are little better than bandits. Players often join or compete with them.

**Demon-Cults** - Those who worship cosmic entities in exchange for power. Some cultists are monsters; others are desperate people making terrible bargains for survival.

**The Rememberers** - Scholars trying to preserve knowledge before it's lost forever. They hire guards to protect libraries and recover texts from ruins. Tragic and doomed but noble.

**Warlord Kingdoms** - Strongmen who seized territory when central authority collapsed. Brutal but straightforward; at least you know where you stand.

**The Unburdened** - Nihilistic hedonists who embrace the ending. "World's dying anyway, might as well enjoy it." From harmless libertines to murderous thrill-seekers.

## Central Conflicts

**The world is ending** - Not dramatically, but through slow decay. Magic depletes, resources diminish, cosmic entities devour reality at the edges. No one knows why or how to stop it. Most don't even realize it's happening.

**Corruption of power** - Magic that could save people also destroys the caster. Kingdoms need sorcerers to defend borders but fear their ambitions. Every solution creates new problems.

**Desperation breeds monstrosity** - Good people do evil things to survive. Honorable warriors become bandits to feed families. Scholars sell forbidden knowledge. Temples turn to demon-worship when gods don't answer. How far will you go?

**Knowledge vs. ignorance** - Understanding the truth (cosmic horror, inevitable ending, gods' cruelty) breaks most minds. Ignorance allows hope but prevents solutions. Is it better to know?

**Meaning in futility** - If the world is doomed, do actions matter? Players must find personal meaning: protecting friends, achieving glory, experiencing pleasure, defying cosmic horror through sheer stubbornness.

**Survival vs. humanity** - Staying alive requires hard choices. When do you cross the line from survivor to monster? Can you do terrible things and remain yourself?

## Potential Adventures

**The Black Caravan** - Players hired to guard merchant convoy through Broken Reach. Simple job becomes nightmare when employer's cargo proves to be occult artifacts attracting demons. First hard choice: deliver evil goods or face consequences?

**Chains of the Ashen Court** - Players captured (or infiltrate) as slaves in imperial capital. Brutal gladiator games, whispered rebellion, opportunity to plunder inner vaults. Escape with treasure or burn it all down?

**The Sorcerer's Price** - Powerful mage offers wealth for simple task: retrieve component from Howling Wastes. Reality-bending horrors await, and component's true purpose is horrifying. Complete contract or betray employer?

**The Last Sanctuary** - Oasis community begs for defense against approaching warlord army. Players could defend (likely suicide), negotiate (moral compromises), or loot and flee (practical but damning). Choose.

**Throne of Ash** - Rumor spreads that Hollow Throne has been found. Factions converge: cultists, mercenaries, sorcerers, the Empress herself. Players caught in middle of power struggle for world-breaking artifact. Join a side, play them against each other, or destroy the Throne?

**The Ending** - As world's death accelerates, players must choose final stance: rage against dying of light, make peace with ending, or attempt impossible gambit to save something (someone?) from oblivion. Campaign finale allowing multiple philosophical endpoints.
