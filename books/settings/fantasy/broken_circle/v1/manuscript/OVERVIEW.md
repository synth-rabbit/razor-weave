# Broken Circle

## Core Concept

Classic epic fantasy where an ancient evil awakens after centuries of imprisonment, but the alliance of races that once defeated it has long since fractured. Humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, beast-folk, and other peoples are divided by prejudice, old grudges, and mutual distrust. Drawing inspiration from Japanese isekai settings and Dragon Age, Broken Circle explores racial tensions, discrimination, and the hard work of overcoming bias to face existential threats.

Players are heroes who must not only confront the returning darkness, but also bridge the gaps between peoples who would rather fight each other than unite. The "Circle" refers to the ancient alliance - can it be mended before it's too late?

## Tone & Themes

**Epic heroism meets social commentary.** The tone balances grand adventure (ancient prophecies, world-threatening evil, legendary artifacts) with intimate character drama (prejudice, belonging, found family). Themes include unity through diversity, confronting one's own biases, the cycle of hatred, redemption and forgiveness, and the courage to stand against both external darkness and internal demons.

Inspired by anime isekai where protagonists navigate racial politics while building diverse parties, and Dragon Age's exploration of species tensions, religious conflict, and marginalization. Heroes must be diplomats and warriors, idealists and pragmatists.

## What Makes It Unique

**Race relations as central pillar** - Unlike fantasy where different species coexist peacefully, Broken Circle makes racial tension a core conflict. Elves view humans as short-lived upstarts. Humans fear dwarven military might. Everyone mistrusts orcs as "savage." Beast-folk face dehumanization. These prejudices aren't window dressing - they actively complicate the quest to unite against evil.

**Diverse party as microcosm** - Player parties typically include multiple races working together despite cultural conditioning. They become proof that cooperation is possible, often serving as diplomatic bridges.

**Ancient evil as common enemy** - The returning darkness doesn't care about race - it threatens everyone equally. Dramatic irony as peoples squabble while doom gathers strength.

**Inspiration from Japanese isekai** - Narrative beats familiar to anime fans: outcasts forming found families, prejudice overcome through demonstrated worth, idealistic protagonists who refuse to accept "that's just how things are," and power systems that transcend racial boundaries.

## Key Locations

**The Sundered Citadel** - Ruins where the Circle once met; now contested border between human and elven territories. Ancient magic still resonates in the stones.

**Ironhold** - Dwarven mountain-kingdom, fortress-like and insular. Technological marvels powered by rune-craft, but deep suspicion of outsiders especially "surfacers."

**The Greenwood Realms** - Elven forest territories, beautiful but exclusionary. Humans forbidden without permission; other races barely tolerated. Long-lived elves remember ancient slights.

**Ashgar Steppes** - Orcish tribal lands, harsh but honorable. Orcs tired of being blamed for ancestors' sins; new generation seeks respect, not conquest.

**The Warrens** - Beast-folk communities in borderlands, denied citizenship by major powers. Diverse species (cat-folk, wolf-folk, bird-folk) cooperating out of necessity.

**Lumina** - Cosmopolitan human city, most diverse major settlement. Melting pot of cultures but also site of racial tensions, slums segregated by species.

**The Veil** - Boundary where ancient evil was sealed; reality weakens there, allowing corruption to seep through. All races fear the Veil.

## Major Factions

**The Remnant Circle** - Small group of idealists from each race trying to rebuild the alliance. Dismissed as naive by their own people; they desperately seek heroes to prove cooperation works.

**Purist Movements** - Reactionary groups within each culture promoting racial superiority and isolation. Human supremacists, elven exclusionists, dwarven traditionalists, etc. They oppose cooperation.

**The Veilwatch** - Military order that monitors the sealed evil regardless of politics. Members from all races work together out of necessity; proof that unity is possible, but they're too few.

**Religious Factions** - Different races worship different gods (or the same gods differently), creating schisms. Some preach unity; others claim their deity favors their race.

**Merchant Leagues** - Pragmatists who've maintained trade between races because profit transcends prejudice. Economically powerful but politically limited.

**The Awakened** - Those corrupted by the returning evil, drawn from all races. They offer dark unity through conquest and domination - a twisted mirror of the Circle.

## Central Conflicts

**External threat:** Ancient evil sealed millennia ago stirs in its prison. Signs of its awakening: reality fractures near the Veil, nightmares plague the sensitive, corrupted creatures emerge, dark cults rise. If freed, it will consume all life regardless of race.

**Internal divisions:**

**Racial prejudice** - Each species has stereotypes about others reinforced by centuries of isolation. Elves see humans as barbaric mayflies. Humans view elves as arrogant and detached. Dwarves distrust both as "surface politics." Orcs painted as violent despite peaceful tribes. Beast-folk treated as second-class or property. Players must overcome these biases in themselves and others.

**Historical grudges** - The Circle broke for reasons lost to time, but each culture remembers being wronged. Competing narratives about who betrayed whom. Truth is complex; blame is shared.

**Power struggles** - Even if convinced of the threat, who leads a renewed alliance? Who has authority? Whose territory becomes battleground? Pride and politics complicate necessity.

**Individual vs. culture** - Players may reject their culture's prejudices but face pressure to conform. How far can they deviate before being branded traitors?

**Cycle of violence** - Retribution breeds retribution. Breaking the cycle requires someone to forgive the unforgivable - possible when world hangs in balance?

## Potential Adventures

**The Broken Pillar** - Heroes from different races independently investigate disturbances at the Sundered Citadel; forced to cooperate when ambushed by corrupted creatures. First meeting as diverse party; perfect starter.

**Embassy of Thorns** - Players must escort reluctant ambassadors from each race to peace talks, protecting them from both assassins and each other. Political intrigue meets action.

**The Orcish Question** - Orc tribe offers aid against coming darkness but human kingdom refuses, citing ancient invasion. Players investigate the truth behind legends and negotiate peace.

**Into the Veil** - Expedition to the weakening seal requires specialists from each race (dwarven runecrafters, elven mages, human warriors, etc.). Forced cooperation in nightmare realm tests everyone.

**The First Stand** - When Awakened army threatens neutral settlement of mixed races, players must organize defense using tactics and magic from all cultures. Victory proves unity's strength.

**Mending the Circle** - Climactic campaign bringing together threads from previous adventures to reunite the races against the fully awakened ancient evil. Heroes become symbols of what's possible.
