# Thornvale

## Core Concept

An interconnected world of anthropomorphic animals across diverse cultural regions, inspired by Redwall but expanded globally. European-inspired forests with badgers and mice neighbor Japanese-inspired mountain temples with tanuki and cranes, while African savanna communities of lions and meerkats trade with Arctic tundra settlements of polar bears and arctic foxes. Each region has distinct architecture, customs, and native species, but all are part of one cohesive world connected by trade routes, shared history, and cultural exchange.

Players are members of these communities - farmers, craftspeople, travelers, peacekeepers - living cozy daily lives while occasionally facing external threats that require cooperation across cultures.

## Tone & Themes

**Mostly peaceful cooperation with heroic adventure when needed.** Thornvale emphasizes community, cultural understanding, feasting and festivals, seasons and harvests, and the satisfaction of building something together. The tone is warm and wholesome like Redwall's abbey life, with room for excitement when vermin hordes, mysterious blights, or ancient evils threaten the peace.

Themes include bridging cultural differences, strength through diversity, protecting what you've built, generational wisdom, and finding courage in ordinary folk. Stories balance cozy slice-of-life (preparing for harvest festival, hosting diplomatic visitors, learning another culture's crafts) with traditional good-versus-evil adventures when darkness arises.

## What Makes It Unique

**Multi-cultural regions in one world** - Players can adventure in European abbey-forests, Japanese mountain temples, African savanna councils, Arctic trading posts, Mediterranean coastal villages, Mesoamerican jungle cities, and more. Each region has authentic cultural inspiration translated through anthropomorphic animals native to those environments.

**Cozy with fantasy elements** - Unlike pure cozy settings, Thornvale allows for classic heroic narratives. When threatened, communities come together to defend themselves. But peace is the norm, and adventures often focus on cooperation over combat.

**Species diversity** - Hundreds of animal species means endless character variety. Players choose animals appropriate to their chosen region or play travelers/diplomats from elsewhere.

## Key Locations

**Deeproot Abbey** - European-inspired monastery in ancient forest; scholarly badgers, industrious mice, hospitality and learning. Traditional Redwall vibes; often serves as neutral meeting ground.

**The Stepstone Sanctum** - Japanese-inspired mountain temple complex; wise tanuki, disciplined cranes, meditation gardens and martial arts training. Spiritual center seeking harmony.

**Pride's Reach** - African savanna council grounds; diplomatic lions, clever meerkats, storytelling traditions and oral histories. Political heart of inter-regional cooperation.

**Frostmeet** - Arctic trading post; resilient polar bears, swift arctic foxes, seasonal migrations and resource sharing. Economic hub for northern regions.

**The Sunward Isles** - Mediterranean coastal villages; social dolphins, industrious otters, shipping and fishing cultures. Connection point between continents.

**Jade Canopy** - Mesoamerican jungle city; colorful macaws, wise jaguars, astronomical knowledge and agricultural terraces. Ancient mysteries.

## Major Factions

**The Circle of Seasons** - Inter-regional council maintaining peace and coordinating responses to threats. Representatives from each major region meet quarterly to share news and resolve disputes.

**The Wandering Guild** - Merchants, performers, and travelers who move between regions. Cultural ambassadors and information network; their caravans are always welcome.

**The Keeper's Lodge** - Historians and lorekeepers from all cultures who preserve stories, map territories, and research ancient threats. Warning system for regional dangers.

**Regional Councils** - Each cultural region has its own governance (abbey leadership, temple elders, savanna pride council, etc.). They manage local affairs while cooperating on larger issues.

## Central Conflicts

**Peaceful cooperation** is the foundation, but threats arise:

**External threats** - Vermin hordes (rats, weasels, stoats organized under cruel leaders) occasionally threaten borders. Natural disasters (floods, droughts, harsh winters) require mutual aid. Mysterious blights affect crops or cause illness. Ancient evils (dark sorcerers, cursed artifacts, malevolent spirits) emerge from forgotten places.

**Cultural misunderstandings** - Different regions have different customs around hospitality, trade, conflict resolution. Players help bridge gaps and prevent diplomatic incidents.

**Resource disputes** - Regions depend on each other for different resources. Occasional tensions over trade terms or territory, always resolved peacefully but requiring negotiation.

**Generational tensions** - Older generation remembers isolated conflicts between regions; younger generation wants deeper cooperation. Some elders resist change while youth push for innovation.

**Good versus evil** - When darkness threatens, communities unite to defend Thornvale. These conflicts have clear moral stakes, allowing for heroic adventure within the cozy framework.

## Potential Adventures

**The Harvest Festival** - Players help organize inter-regional festival at Deeproot Abbey, welcoming guests from across Thornvale, solving small crises, and building friendships. Perfect starter one-shot showcasing multiple cultures.

**The Shadow in the North** - Vermin warlord gathers forces near Frostmeet; players must travel between regions building alliance, gathering supplies, and ultimately defending against the horde.

**The Silent Blight** - Mysterious illness affects crops across multiple regions simultaneously; players investigate source, traveling between cultural areas and discovering ancient curse that requires cooperation to break.

**The Lost Caravan** - Wandering Guild caravan goes missing between regions; search and rescue reveals conspiracy to disrupt inter-regional trade, testing diplomatic bonds.

**The Circle Convenes** - Players represent their home region at quarterly Circle of Seasons meeting; must navigate politics, forge alliances, and respond to emerging threats while respecting different cultural approaches.
