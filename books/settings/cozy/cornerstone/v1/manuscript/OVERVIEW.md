# Cornerstone

## Core Concept

A small town sits at the intersection of magical ley lines and dimensional crossroads, creating a nexus where worlds touch. Players run magical businesses - shops, cafes, bookstores, apothecaries - serving both local residents and exotic travelers from across realities. Most of the year, Cornerstone is a quiet community where everyone knows everyone. But when the ley lines align during seasonal convergences, the town transforms into a bustling magical marketplace drawing merchants, scholars, and wanderers from countless realms.

## Tone & Themes

**Cozy community with bursts of wonder.** Cornerstone balances quiet daily life with seasonal excitement. Themes include finding your place in a community, bridging different cultures and worlds, the magic in ordinary kindness, and balancing business ambitions with relationships. Stories focus on helping neighbors, solving small mysteries, welcoming strange visitors, and the satisfaction of building something lasting.

The tone is warm and low-stakes, but never boring - the crossroads nature ensures interesting problems and delightful surprises. Think Stardew Valley meets Howl's Moving Castle, where the extraordinary becomes wonderfully ordinary.

## What Makes It Unique

The **seasonal convergence** creates natural story rhythms. Most adventures happen during convergence festivals when the town swells with visitors, rare goods appear, and dimensional quirks cause harmless chaos. Between convergences, players develop their businesses, deepen local relationships, and prepare for the next surge.

**Player agency in business type** - players choose whether to run a magic shop, cozy cafe, bookstore, apothecary, or other magical business. The setting supports all approaches, with the business serving as both narrative anchor and gameplay focus.

**Crossroads traffic** brings endless variety without leaving town. Customers might include dimension-hopping merchants, lost travelers from distant realms, magical creatures seeking specific goods, or researchers studying the convergence. Each visitor brings their own story.

## Key Locations

**The Plaza** - Town center where ley lines visibly intersect; during convergences, the plaza becomes a vibrant marketplace with impossible geometry and shifting vendor stalls.

**The Threshold Inn** - Cornerstone's only inn, run by the Keeper (a mysterious figure who's been here "as long as anyone remembers"). Houses travelers and serves as information hub.

**The Old Bridge** - Stone bridge over a stream that connects different realities during convergences; crossing it at the right moment leads to unexpected places.

**The Community Hall** - Where townspeople gather for festivals, meetings, and crisis coordination; walls covered in notices, requests, and thank-you notes.

**The Greenway** - Gardens and groves around town's edge where ley line energy makes plants grow in unusual ways; source of rare ingredients.

## Major Factions

**The Merchants' Circle** - Local business owners who maintain town traditions and help newcomers establish themselves. Friendly rivalry and mutual support.

**The Convergence Scholars** - Researchers who study the ley lines and dimensional phenomena. Always seeking data, sometimes causing accidents, generally helpful.

**Seasonal Traders** - Regular visitors who time their routes to convergences. Build relationships over multiple visits; know secrets of many worlds.

**The Keeper's Network** - Mysterious group connected to the Threshold Inn's Keeper. They ensure Cornerstone remains neutral ground for all travelers; enforce few but important rules.

## Central Conflicts

**Peaceful cooperation** dominates Cornerstone, but gentle tensions arise:

- **Convergence mishaps** - Dimensional bleed creates harmless chaos (talking objects, swapped languages, time loops affecting single buildings). Problems to solve creatively rather than combat.

- **Cultural misunderstandings** - Visitors from different realms have conflicting customs. Players help bridge gaps and prevent offense.

- **Business competition** - Friendly rivalry between shops, especially during convergences when reputation matters. Who can fulfill the most unusual request?

- **Balancing growth and tradition** - As Cornerstone grows more popular, some worry about losing small-town character. Finding middle path.

- **Rare external threats** - Occasionally something dangerous slips through during convergences. Community must work together to protect the town without violence when possible.

## Potential Adventures

**The First Convergence** - Players arrive in Cornerstone just before a major convergence, establish their business, meet locals, and experience the festival chaos. Perfect starter one-shot.

**The Lost Shipment** - Dimensional trader's goods scattered across multiple realities; players must track down items by following ley line echoes, meeting strange beings along the way.

**The Recipe Paradox** - Customer requests dish from their homeland, but key ingredient only exists in contradictory states across different dimensions. Players must navigate reality quirks to fulfill the order.

**Convergence Council** - When unprecedented seven-way convergence approaches, players help organize unprecedented festival while managing various factions' concerns and preventing dimensional instability.

**The Bridge Between** - Old Bridge starts connecting to somewhere it shouldn't; players investigate mystery involving the Keeper's past and the true nature of Cornerstone's founding.
