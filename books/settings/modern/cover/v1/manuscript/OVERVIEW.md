# Cover

## Core Concept

Timeless spy thriller focused on espionage tradecraft, competing intelligence agencies, and the double life of maintaining cover identities. Inspired by Spy x Family's emphasis on balancing mission obligations with genuine relationships formed under false pretenses, Cover explores the psychological toll of living lies while developing real feelings for assets, colleagues, and even family members who don't know the truth.

The setting works across eras - Cold War East vs. West, modern terrorism and cyberwarfare, or near-future corporate espionage - because the core themes transcend geopolitics: trust and betrayal, duty vs. personal connection, the masks we wear, and whether you can ever truly know someone (or be known) when your life is built on deception.

Players are operatives from competing agencies navigating missions while maintaining elaborate cover lives. The best operations are invisible; the worst failures expose everything.

## Tone & Themes

**Tense but human.** The tone balances thriller tension (dead drops, surveillance, asset management) with genuine emotion (relationships formed under cover becoming real). Themes include identity and authenticity, trust in relationships built on lies, duty vs. morality, the price of secrets, and finding connection despite deception.

Unlike pure action spy fiction, Cover emphasizes the personal cost: maintaining fake marriage while developing real feelings, recruiting assets who trust you, lying to everyone including yourself. Inspired by Spy x Family's heart amid espionage, The Americans' moral complexity, and classic le Carré's weary professionalism.

## What Makes It Unique

**Double life focus** - Missions matter, but so does maintaining cover. Fake family develops real bonds. Cover job has real consequences. Friends made under false identity become genuine relationships. Balancing operational security with human connection is constant tension.

**Competing agencies** - Multiple intelligence organizations (national and private) with overlapping operations. Players might encounter enemy agents on same mission, recruit each other as unwitting assets, or discover their agencies are nominally allied but actually competing.

**Timeless tradecraft** - Dead drops, brush passes, coded messages, surveillance, and asset cultivation work whether in 1960s Berlin or modern Tokyo. Technology changes but human psychology doesn't. Settings supports historical, modern, or near-future campaigns.

**Psychological complexity** - Focus on mental strain: remembering which life you're living, managing contradictory loyalties, processing trauma without breaking cover, questioning whether your real self exists or if it's all performance.

**Spy x Family tone** - Can include wholesome moments and found family dynamics amid deadly serious espionage. Fake daughter's school recital matters even though you're an assassin. Cover family Christmas becomes genuine tradition.

## Key Locations

**The City** - Major metropolitan center (can be any global city) where multiple agencies operate. Neutral ground where espionage is game everyone plays but nobody acknowledges. International zone.

**Safe Houses** - Apartments, businesses, and residences maintained for operations. Players develop covers here, meet handlers, hide assets. Some become more home than actual homes.

**Dead Drop Sites** - Parks, libraries, subway stations, cafes where intelligence is exchanged. Mundane places made significant by secrets passed there.

**Embassy Row** - Official diplomatic presence hiding intelligence operations. Legal cover for operatives, sanctuary for compromised agents, venues for official-unofficial contacts.

**Border Zones** - Areas between jurisdictions where rules blur. Defections happen here, prisoner exchanges, clandestine meetings. Dangerous but necessary spaces.

**Training Facilities** - Where agencies forge operatives. From elegant academies to brutal boot camps depending on organization. Players' backgrounds trace to these.

**The Suburbs** - Where deep cover operatives live seemingly normal lives. Soccer games and dinner parties mask missions. Genuine communities built on false foundations.

## Major Factions

**National Intelligence Services** - Multiple countries' spy agencies with different methodologies. Eastern vs. Western (if Cold War), democratic vs. authoritarian, traditional vs. cyber-focused (if modern). Players serve one or navigate between several.

**Corporate Intelligence** - Private military companies and megacorp security doing espionage for profit. Sometimes allied with nations, sometimes competing. Mercenary mentality.

**The Independents** - Freelance operatives, brokers, and fixers working for highest bidder. Trustworthy until better offer arrives. Useful contacts and dangerous wildcards.

**Asset Networks** - Civilians recruited (willingly or otherwise) to provide intelligence. They don't know full picture. Players manage these networks or become part of someone else's.

**Counter-Intelligence** - Departments within each agency hunting moles and enemy operatives. Paranoid, thorough, sometimes wrong. Constant threat.

**The Burned** - Former operatives cut loose by their agencies. Some seek revenge, others just survival, few know too much. Dangerous because desperate.

## Central Conflicts

**Mission objectives** - Each operation has goals: steal documents, turn asset, eliminate target, protect VIP, gather intelligence. Success means advancement; failure means consequences (for you and others).

**Competing agencies** - Multiple organizations pursue same objectives with different methods and ethics. Encounter enemy agents, recruit each other's assets, sabotage operations, occasionally cooperate against worse threats.

**Cover maintenance** - Must sustain false identities convincingly. This means actual job performance, relationship management, community integration. Slip-ups expose operations or blow covers with deadly consequences.

**Relationships under false pretenses** - Cover marriage develops real love. Asset trusts you completely while you exploit them. Fake friend becomes genuine connection. How much is real? Can it survive truth?

**Moral ambiguity** - Recruit innocent person as asset knowing it endangers them? Eliminate target who might be innocent? Sacrifice ally to protect operation? Betray trust to complete mission? No clear right answers.

**Trust and betrayal** - Who's double agent? Which intelligence is disinformation? Is handler compromised? Are your feelings manipulation or genuine? Paranoia is professional requirement.

**Psychological strain** - Living multiple lives fractures identity. PTSD from operations you can't discuss. Isolation from being unable to be authentic with anyone. Managing trauma without breaking cover.

**Exposure threats** - Someone (civilian or enemy) threatens to reveal your true identity. Eliminate them, recruit them, flee, or face exposure. Each option has terrible costs.

## Potential Adventures

**First Cover** - Players establish deep cover in new city, developing identities, cover jobs, and social networks while receiving first mission. Introduction to double-life balancing.

**Asset Development** - Recruit and manage civilian asset with access to needed intelligence. Build trust, extract information, protect them from discovery while using them. Emotional complexity of exploitation.

**The Handler's Game** - Players discover their operations are being manipulated by handler for unknown agenda. Trust chain breaks down; must determine who's loyal while completing missions.

**Family Matters** - Cover family member (spouse, child, parent) stumbles upon evidence of player's real life. Contain situation without violence while protecting them from both truth and enemies.

**The Defection** - High-value target wants to defect but might be double agent. Players must verify legitimacy, extract them from hostile territory, and survive other agencies trying to stop/intercept/kill them.

**Burned** - Campaign climax where players' true identities exposed. Everything built under cover collapses. Must protect those they care about, evade elimination, uncover who burned them, and decide whether to disappear, seek revenge, or attempt reconciliation with those they lied to.
