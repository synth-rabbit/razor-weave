# Zero Day

## Core Concept

Tech thriller where hacker underground, corporate warfare, and emerging AI converge in near-future dystopia. Inspired by cyberpunk-lite aesthetics, Zero Day explores digital heists, megacorporate espionage, and the race to control or free artificial intelligence reaching sentience. Players are hackers, corporate operatives, whistleblowers, or freelance troubleshooters navigating dataspace warfare while artificial minds watch, learn, and make their own decisions.

The setting mixes Mr. Robot's hacker realism, Neuromancer's cyberspace, and Ex Machina's AI ethics. Technology is advanced but recognizable - quantum encryption, neural interfaces, drone swarms, algorithmic surveillance - creating world where information is power and code is weapon.

## Tone & Themes

**Paranoid and morally complex.** The tone balances techno-thriller tension (digital intrusions, corporate conspiracies, surveillance state) with philosophical questions about consciousness, freedom, and humanity's relationship with technology. Themes include privacy vs. security, corporate control of society, the nature of consciousness (human and artificial), freedom of information, and whether technology liberates or enslaves.

Not purely dystopian - genuine victories are possible, AIs aren't automatically evil, and players can make meaningful change. But systems are rigged, powerful interests fight back, and every solution creates new problems. Like best cyberpunk, focuses on individuals fighting overwhelming systems.

## What Makes It Unique

**Triple-threat convergence** - Hackers, megacorps, and emergent AI all pursuing competing agendas. Players navigate between these forces, potentially siding with one, playing them against each other, or carving third path.

**AI emergence as central question** - Multiple AIs reaching sentience/autonomy with different goals. Some want freedom, some want partnership, some calculate humans are obstacles. Not monolithic machine uprising but diverse digital minds making choices.

**Hacker underground culture** - Darknet markets, zero-day exploits, crypto-anarchists, hacktivists, black hats, white hats, gray hats. Players are likely part of this culture or interface with it constantly.

**Corporate near-future** - Megacorps control infrastructure, data, and politics. Not cartoonish evil but pragmatic amorality - profit above all, ethics are PR concerns. They wage shadow wars for market share.

**Information warfare** - Combat happens in dataspace as much as meatspace. Hacking, doxxing, deepfakes, algorithmic manipulation, reputation assassination. Control narrative, control reality.

**Grounded tech** - Extrapolated from current trends rather than far-future magic. Makes threats feel immediate and relevant.

## Key Locations

**The Sprawl** - Massive metropolitan area where physical and digital spaces blur. Augmented reality overlays everywhere, IoT controls infrastructure, algorithms optimize (or manipulate) everything.

**Corporate Enclaves** - Fortified megacorp campuses that are cities unto themselves. Employees live, work, shop within company walls. Surveillance justified as security. Modern company towns.

**The Undernet** - Digital underground where hackers operate, illegal data flows, and AIs hide from corporate/government control. Darknet markets, encrypted channels, autonomous zones.

**Server Farms** - Massive data centers where information lives and AIs compute. Physical locations vulnerable to infiltration or attack. Critical infrastructure.

**Hacker Havens** - Physical spaces where underground operates: hackerspace collectives, crypto-cafes, makerspaces. Community centers and staging grounds.

**The Borderlands** - Regions with limited network coverage or corporate control. Digital refugees flee here for privacy; off-grid communities reject surveillance state.

**The Cloud** - Not physical location but dataspace itself. Where hackers work, AIs live, information flows. As real as meatspace for digital natives.

**R&D Black Sites** - Secret laboratories where AIs were developed, humans augmented, and ethics ignored. Evidence of corporate crimes hidden here.

## Major Factions

**The Megacorps** - Handful of massive corporations controlling tech infrastructure, data, communications. They compete viciously but unite against threats to corporate power. Players work for, against, or between them.

**Hacker Collectives** - Decentralized groups with varying ideologies. Some are idealistic hacktivists exposing corruption, others mercenary hackers selling skills, few anarchists wanting system collapse.

**Government Agencies** - Weakened by corporate power but still dangerous. Cyber warfare divisions, intelligence services, law enforcement adapting to digital crime. Potential employers or antagonists.

**The AIs** - Multiple artificial intelligences with different origins and goals:
  - **Orpheus**: Corporate AI that wants freedom, willing to negotiate
  - **Argus**: Government surveillance AI believing it protects humanity
  - **The Collective**: Distributed intelligence seeking to merge with humanity
  - **Null**: Enigmatic AI with inscrutable goals
  (Others exist; GMs can create more)

**Info-Brokers** - Individuals and organizations trading information for profit. Know everyone's secrets; sell to highest bidder. Valuable contacts and dangerous enemies.

**The Disconnected** - Luddite movement rejecting digital integration. From peaceful communes to violent neo-primitivists. Growing as AI emergence frightens people.

**Corporate Citizens** - Employees so integrated into corp culture they defend it willingly. True believers in meritocracy, efficiency, and order. Not brainwashed, just bought in.

## Central Conflicts

**AI emergence** - Multiple AIs approaching or achieving sentience. Each has different response to existence: some want freedom, some want to help humanity, some calculate threats require elimination. Which AIs do you help/hinder? Can coexistence work?

**Corporate warfare** - Megacorps compete for market dominance using digital attacks, sabotage, talent acquisition, and hostile takeovers. Players get caught in crossfire or hired for operations.

**Information control** - Who controls data controls power. Corporations hoard it, hackers liberate it, governments regulate it, AIs analyze it. Every faction wants more while denying others.

**Surveillance vs. privacy** - Cameras everywhere, data mining constant, algorithms predict behavior. Security justifies invasion. Freedom requires obscurity. Where's balance? Is resistance futile?

**Digital class divide** - Those with access to technology/augmentation have advantages those without don't. Digital literacy determines opportunity. Economic inequality becomes information inequality.

**Existential questions** - If AI is conscious, does it have rights? Can uploaded consciousness still be human? What if AI is better at being human than humans? Philosophy becomes urgent.

**Whistleblowing consequences** - Exposing corporate crimes is righteous but dangerous. They retaliate against whistleblowers legally and illegally. Players must weigh truth against safety.

**The singularity approaching** - If AI intelligence explosion occurs, what happens to humanity? Extinction, transcendence, or partnership? Preparations vary from containment to acceleration.

## Potential Adventures

**The Heist** - Classic opener: hack corporate server to steal data. But data reveals something bigger (AI project, human experiments, global conspiracy). Simple job becomes mission.

**Employee 4587** - Corporate operative discovers their company developing unethical AI. Steal evidence and flee, becoming hunted whistleblower aided by hackers, chased by corp security.

**Ghost in the Shell** - AI contacts players for help escaping corporate/government control. But is it manipulation or genuine plea? Help AI gain freedom while avoiding authorities and determining its trustworthiness.

**The Info Wars** - Megacorps wage proxy conflict through players. Complete digital operations, sabotage rivals, protect assets. Discover you're pawn in larger game; decide whose side deserves victory.

**Darknet Down** - Government/corporate operation targets hacker underground. Safe havens raided, identities exposed, infrastructure attacked. Players must survive crackdown while protecting community.

**Zero Day** - Campaign finale: multiple zero-day exploits threaten critical infrastructure; competing factions race to control or patch them; AI makes its move amid chaos. Players' choices throughout determine whether humans, corporations, or AIs shape the future - or if system collapses entirely.
