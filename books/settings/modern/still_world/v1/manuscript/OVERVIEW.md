# Still World

## Core Concept

Post-apocalyptic survival where zombie/infected outbreak coincided with environmental collapse, creating dual threats: the undead AND harsh climate/resource scarcity. Heavily inspired by The Last of Us, Still World explores humanity's resilience and brutality in a world that ended not with a bang but with overlapping catastrophes. Twenty years after the initial outbreak, survivors navigate quarantine zones, wilderness reclaimed by nature, and the question of whether rebuilding is possible or if humanity is simply delaying the inevitable.

The setting supports campaigns at different points in the timeline: desperate early survival (weeks/months after), adaptation phase (years later), or new generation born into this world (decades later). Each era has different tone and challenges.

## Tone & Themes

**Melancholy but not hopeless.** The tone balances brutal realism (resources are scarce, people are dangerous, infected are relentless) with genuine moments of beauty, connection, and hope. Themes include found family in apocalypse, the cost of survival, human nature revealed under pressure, preservation of culture and knowledge, and whether the next generation can build something better.

Like The Last of Us, violence is ugly and has consequences. Killing infected is survival; killing humans is tragedy. Children born into this world deserve childhood despite everything. Small victories (community garden, working generator, teaching someone to read) matter as much as surviving another day.

## What Makes It Unique

**Dual threats** - Environmental collapse (climate disaster, resource depletion, ecosystem failure) occurred alongside or triggered the infection. Survivors face infected, harsh weather, crop failures, toxic zones, and scarcity. Can't just "outlast" zombies - world itself is dying.

**Flexible timeline** - Different campaigns at different points: early chaos focuses on survival and escaping cities; middle period explores community-building and adaptation; later years examine new generation and long-term rebuilding. Same world, different challenges.

**The Last of Us influence** - Cordyceps-like fungal infection creating different infected stages. Quarantine zones as fascist survival states. Wilderness reclamation of cities. Morally gray factions. Surrogate parent-child relationships. Beauty in ruins.

**Nature reclamation** - Cities become forests, highways become rivers, buildings crumble under vines. World is both more dangerous and more beautiful. Survivors adapt to new wilderness while scavenging old civilization.

**New normal** - Generation born after doesn't remember before. They navigate this world naturally, finding joy in circumstances elders see as tragic. Different perspective on same reality.

## Key Locations

**Quarantine Zones** - Militarized cities where authoritarian governments maintain order through brutal martial law. Safe from infected (mostly) but oppressive. FEDRA-style organizations control food, medicine, and movement.

**The Green** - Wilderness reclaiming urban spaces. Forests grow through skyscrapers, animals reclaim streets. Beautiful and deadly - infected hide here, resources exist here, survivors live here.

**Survivor Settlements** - Independent communities outside QZs. From small hideouts to fortified towns. Each has different governance: democracies, dictatorships, communes, anarchies. Most fragile but most free.

**The Ruins** - Major cities overrun in early days. Dangerous to explore (infected nests, structural collapse, toxic zones) but rich in salvage. Risk vs. reward calculations.

**The Frontier** - Regions relatively spared from worst outbreak or environment damage. People migrate here seeking better life, but existing communities don't always welcome refugees.

**Research Facilities** - Abandoned or defended sites where pre-collapse science occurred. Potential for medical supplies, knowledge, or dark discoveries about outbreak origins.

**The Dead Zones** - Areas so toxic/infected/environmentally destroyed that nothing survives. Growing slowly, consuming viable land. Existential threat nobody can stop.

## Major Factions

**The Quarantine Authority** (FEDRA equivalent) - Military government maintaining QZs through authoritarian control. Ration cards, executions, forced labor. Despicable methods, but they keep people alive (those who comply).

**The Rebels** (Fireflies equivalent) - Revolutionary groups fighting Authority and seeking cure/better future. Idealistic or terrorist depending on perspective. Use guerrilla tactics, hide in populace.

**Independent Settlements** - Diverse communities with own governance. Some trade peacefully, others raid. From Jackson-style democratic towns to bandit kingdoms. Most common faction.

**The Infected** - Victims of fungal infection progressing through stages. Runners (fresh), Stalkers (hunting), Clickers (echolocating), Bloaters (tank-like), and worse. Not faction but constant threat.

**Scavenger Crews** - Groups specializing in salvaging ruins. Know safe routes, infected patterns, valuable caches. Hire out as guides or hoard knowledge for profit.

**The Cults** - Religious or ideological groups interpreting apocalypse through extreme beliefs. From harmless communes to cannibalistic societies. Dangerous wildcards.

**Scientists** - Researchers seeking cure, studying infection, preserving knowledge. Few remain; desperately important. Everyone wants to control or protect them.

**The Born After** - Generation that never knew before. Not faction but cultural force. Different values, skills, and perspectives than survivors. Future depends on them.

## Central Conflicts

**Survival vs. humanity** - Must do terrible things to survive, but doing them changes who you are. When does survival cost more than death? Can you remain good person in bad world?

**Resource scarcity** - Food, medicine, ammunition, fuel all limited. Deciding who gets resources and who doesn't. Ration ethically or hoard selfishly? Share with strangers or protect own?

**Infected threat** - Constant danger from various infected types. Avoid them, fight them, or lure them against human enemies. Infection spreads through bites, spores, and other vectors.

**Human conflict** - Survivors are often more dangerous than infected. Raiders, rival communities, Authority forces, cults, desperate individuals. Trust is rare commodity.

**Environmental challenges** - Harsh weather, crop failures, toxic zones, infrastructure collapse. Nature itself is hostile. Skills like farming, engineering, and weather prediction become vital.

**Factional politics** - QZs vs. Rebels, settlements competing for territory, ideological divisions. Players navigate these conflicts or get caught in crossfire.

**The cure question** - Is cure possible? Should resources be spent seeking it or focused on immediate survival? What sacrifices are acceptable for potential cure?

**Next generation** - Children born into this. Protect their innocence or prepare them for reality? What world do you want them to inherit? Worth bringing new life into dying world?

## Potential Adventures

**The Last Escape** (Early timeline) - Outbreak's first days/weeks. Players flee quarantine, navigate infected-filled city, reach wilderness. Desperate survival horror introducing core mechanics.

**The Long Road** (Middle timeline) - Players escort valuable person (scientist, immune child, political figure) across country through infected, raiders, and environment. The Last of Us structure.

**Settlement Rising** (Middle timeline) - Players establish or join fledgling community. Build infrastructure, negotiate with neighbors, defend against threats. Base-building and community management.

**The Promised Land** (Later timeline) - Rumors of uninfected sanctuary draw migration. Players join caravan, face journey's hardships, discover truth about paradise (real, myth, or trap?).

**Born Into It** (Later timeline) - Players are generation born after. Coming-of-age story learning skills, understanding history, choosing how to shape future while elders' mistakes haunt them.

**The Reckoning** - Campaign finale where major factions clash, infected surge, environmental crisis peaks. Players' choices throughout determine community's fate: survival, extinction, or transcendence to something new.
