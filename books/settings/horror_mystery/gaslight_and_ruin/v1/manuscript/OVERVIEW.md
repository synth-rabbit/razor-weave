# Gaslight & Ruin

## Core Concept

Film noir meets occult investigation in a timeless city where hard-boiled detectives uncover supernatural conspiracies. Inspired by LA Noire, Dresden Files, and classic noir films, Gaslight & Ruin blends rain-slicked streets and moral ambiguity with hidden magic, secret societies, and eldritch crime. The City exists in flexible time period - it could be 1940s classic noir, modern urban, or anywhere between. The aesthetic remains constant: shadows, sin, and secrets.

Players are typically investigators - private eyes, cops, reporters, or freelance troubleshooters - who stumble into the occult underworld and can't look away. Every case peels back another layer revealing how deep the corruption runs, how many institutions are compromised, and how little separates law from lawlessness when magic is involved.

## Tone & Themes

**Cynical but not hopeless.** The tone embraces noir's moral ambiguity, world-weariness, and atmospheric gloom while allowing for genuine victories and heroic choices. Themes include corruption and redemption, truth at any cost, the weight of knowledge, urban decay hiding ancient evil, and the question of whether fighting the darkness makes you part of it.

Like the best noir, femme fatales might be victims, authorities might be villains, and doing the right thing often costs everything. But unlike pure grimdark, individual choices matter and small victories count. One honest detective can't clean up The City, but they can save someone tonight.

## What Makes It Unique

**Timeless noir aesthetic** - The City works in multiple eras without breaking immersion. Classic 1940s with fedoras and cigarettes, modern day with cell phones and computers, or ambiguous anywhere-time mixing period elements. Noir feeling transcends specific technology.

**Occult noir fusion** - Magic isn't random or chaotic; it's organized crime. Demon-powered protection rackets, curse-for-hire services, occult smuggling operations, and magical substances traded in back alleys. Supernatural meets criminal enterprise.

**The City as character** - Like Chandler's Los Angeles or Miller's Sin City, The City has personality. Rain-soaked, corrupt, beautiful and terrible. Neighborhoods have distinct feels: ritzy Hightown hiding dark secrets, industrial Lowgate where reality bends, neon-lit Red District where vice is religion.

**Information as mystery fuel** - Classic noir investigation structure: follow leads, interview witnesses, piece together truth. But witnesses lie for magical reasons, evidence is cursed, and truth might cost your sanity or soul.

**Flexible moral choices** - Players aren't forced into cynicism. They can be idealistic crusaders, pragmatic survivors, or corrupt sell-outs. The City tests their principles; what they become is up to them.

## Key Locations

**Downtown** - Heart of The City where business and politics mix. Skyscrapers and government buildings above, speakeasies and occult parlors below. Power brokers make deals that affect millions.

**Hightown** - Where the wealthy live in mansions and penthouses. Clean streets hide dirty secrets. Many old families dabble in dark arts for status or power.

**The Docks** - Industrial waterfront where smuggling operations bring in everything from mundane contraband to cursed artifacts. Longshoreman unions include secret societies.

**Lowgate** - Working-class district where reality is thin. Factories belch smoke and something else. Residents know not to ask questions about night sounds.

**The Red District** - Official sin: gambling, prostitution, nightclubs. Also unofficial: blood magic brothels, demon-summoning casinos, vice that transcends physical pleasure into spiritual corruption.

**Old Town** - Historic district built on city's foundation. Original settlement has layer upon layer of construction; ancient cult temples exist beneath modern basements.

**The Yards** - Train yards and industrial zones where the disappeared end up. Murder investigations start here; occult investigations end here.

**The Precinct** - Police headquarters. Some cops are honest, some corrupt, some know about supernatural and suppress it, others know and exploit it. Players navigate these factions.

## Major Factions

**The Police Department** - Divided between honest cops trying to do good, corrupt cops on criminal payrolls, and those who know about the occult (some containing it, others profiting from it). Players might be cops or work with/against them.

**The Syndicates** - Organized crime runs The City. Traditional mobs compete with occult-powered gangs. Some bosses are powerful sorcerers; others hire magical muscle. Always recruiting desperate mages.

**The Velvet Circle** - Secret society of wealthy elites using magic to maintain power and extend lives. Influence police, judges, politicians. Run The City from shadows for generations.

**The Order of Keys** - Occult investigators who police magical community. Prevent exposure, contain dangerous artifacts, eliminate rogue mages. Potential allies or antagonists depending on player actions.

**Street Mages** - Practitioners without institutional power. Hedge witches, self-taught sorcerers, folk magic users. Some help communities; others hustle for survival. Most diverse magical group.

**The Faithful** - Churches, temples, and spiritual organizations. Some know magic exists and fight it; others wield divine power. Range from corrupt televangelists to genuine saints.

**The Press** - Newspapers, radio (or modern equivalents). Some reporters investigate truth fearlessly; others are mouthpieces for powerful interests. Information warriors in propaganda war.

**Femmes Fatales & Tragic Figures** - Classic noir archetypes who draw players into cases. Mysterious women with dangerous secrets, desperate men making bad choices, innocents caught in dark webs.

## Central Conflicts

**Occult crime** - Supernatural powers used for criminal enterprise. Cursed protection rackets ("accidents" happen to those who don't pay), black market artifacts, magical substances, demon-powered enforcers. Players investigate these operations.

**Institutional corruption** - Police, judges, politicians compromised by Syndicates or Velvet Circle. Evidence disappears, witnesses recant, cases die in courtrooms. Fighting system that's rigged.

**Truth vs. survival** - Investigating too deep gets you killed or worse. Every case reveals horrible truths. How much do you chase? When do you walk away? Can you live with what you know?

**Moral compromise** - Sometimes solving case means dealing with criminals, using dirty methods, or sacrificing innocents. Do ends justify means? Where's your line?

**Hidden societies** - Secret organizations pulling strings across The City. Uncovering them is dangerous; they've survived by eliminating threats. Players become threats.

**Reality degradation** - Magic use corrupts The City physically and spiritually. Neighborhoods become twisted, people transform, barriers weaken. Can it be stopped or only slowed?

**Personal demons** - Noir protagonists have tragic pasts, addictions, failures. Players carry trauma and temptation. The City preys on weakness; staying clean (literally or morally) is constant struggle.

**The Big One** - Every noir detective seeks the case that makes sense of everything. The conspiracy behind conspiracies. Does it exist or is that hope just another corruption?

## Potential Adventures

**Dame with Dangerous Eyes** - Classic opener: attractive client hires players to find missing person. Investigation reveals cult, murder, and client's own dark involvement. Whose side are you on?

**Dockside Dying** - Bodies found drained of blood near warehouses. Trail leads to smuggling operation bringing in vampire-adjacent parasites. Stop operation before plague spreads or profit from knowledge?

**The Velvet Murders** - Someone's killing Velvet Circle members using their own magic against them. Players investigate while Circle manipulates police and covers up supernatural elements. Hunter is victim; which side wins?

**Lowgate Lockdown** - Reality fracture in Lowgate threatens exposure of supernatural world. Order of Keys quarantines district with civilians inside. Players must close breach while saving innocents and keeping secret.

**The Precinct** - Corruption investigation within police department reveals some cops are literally demon-possessed. Clean up department or expose truth? Either option has terrible consequences.

**The City Bleeds** - Campaign finale where all threads converge: Syndicates war with Circle, Order of Keys struggles to contain exposure, reality frays, and Big Conspiracy reveals itself. Players choose The City's fate.
