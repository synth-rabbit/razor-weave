<h1 id="ph-introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>You’re about to step into a world shaped by dice, decisions, and
shared imagination. Whether you’re completely new to tabletop
roleplaying or a veteran learning a new system, this guide will teach
you everything you need to create compelling characters, interact with
the rules, and work with your group to tell unforgettable stories.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a manual—it’s an invitation to collaborative
storytelling. You’ll learn how to build characters with depth and
mechanical teeth, navigate the fiction through meaningful choices, and
engage with a system designed to support bold action and dramatic
consequences. The game adapts to your group’s preferred style, whether
you crave tactical combat, tense investigation, social intrigue, or a
mix of everything.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-first">What You Need to Know First</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the details, let’s establish some core
concepts:</p>
<p><strong>The GM (Game Master)</strong> is the person who facilitates
the game. They describe the world, portray non-player characters
(NPCs—characters not controlled by players), adjudicate rules, and frame
situations. Think of them as your collaborative partner, not an
opponent. The GM sets scenes and challenges, but everyone at the table
works together to create compelling stories.</p>
<p><strong>Your PC (Player Character)</strong> is the character you
create and control. You decide what they do, how they approach problems,
and what drives them. Your PC is your lens into the game world and your
primary means of engaging with the story.</p>
<p><strong>Sessions and Campaigns</strong>: A session is a single play
session, typically 2-4 hours. Multiple connected sessions form a
campaign—a longer story told over weeks or months. Some campaigns are
episodic (self-contained stories each session), while others build
toward major narrative arcs.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Storytelling</strong>: This game thrives on
collaboration. The GM frames situations and interprets outcomes, but you
drive the action through your choices. Everyone contributes to the
emerging narrative. When you roll dice, you’re not just checking for
success—you’re determining how the story shifts in response to your
actions.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-game-is-about">What This Game Is About</h2>
<p>At its core, this is a game about <strong>meaningful choices and
their consequences</strong>. You make decisions that matter. Outcomes
reshape the world. Pressure builds toward resolution. The system handles
uncertainty and translates your actions into dynamic results that drive
the story forward.</p>
<h3 id="genre-flexibility">Genre Flexibility</h3>
<p>The game is deliberately <strong>genre-flexible</strong>. The core
mechanics adapt to support:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heroic Fantasy</strong>: Bold adventurers facing dangerous
quests, ancient evils, and larger-than-life stakes. Think legendary
heroes, epic battles, and world-threatening dangers.</li>
<li><strong>Cozy Slice-of-Life</strong>: Low-stakes stories focused on
community, relationships, and personal growth. Run a tavern, solve
neighborhood disputes, or navigate the drama of small-town life.</li>
<li><strong>Mystery &amp; Horror</strong>: Tense investigations,
atmospheric dread, and dangerous secrets. Uncover conspiracies, survive
supernatural threats, or solve crimes in the shadows.</li>
<li><strong>Modern Settings</strong>: Contemporary crime, espionage,
urban fantasy, or everyday drama. Navigate complex social systems,
corporate intrigue, or street-level conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Science Fiction</strong>: Space exploration, cyberpunk
intrigue, transhumanism, or post-apocalyptic survival. The mechanics
scale from intimate personal stories to galaxy-spanning conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<p>You bring the setting and tone. The system provides structure for
action, consequence, and momentum. The same rules that govern a wizard’s
arcane duel work equally well for a detective’s interrogation or a
pilot’s desperate maneuver through an asteroid field.</p>
<h3 id="core-themes">Core Themes</h3>
<p>Across all genres and tones, the game emphasizes:</p>
<p><strong>Risk and Consequence</strong>: Your actions have weight.
Success creates opportunities. Failure introduces complications. Every
roll shapes the fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Momentum</strong>: The game pushes forward. Even failures
move the story rather than stalling it. Partial successes give you
progress with a cost. The narrative builds toward climactic moments.</p>
<p><strong>Agency</strong>: You control your character’s choices and
approach. The GM frames situations, but you decide how to engage. Your
decisions drive the story.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful Outcomes</strong>: Mechanics translate into
fiction. A good roll isn’t just “you succeed”—it’s “you pick the lock
silently, find a hidden compartment, and recognize the maker’s mark as
belonging to a notorious guild.”</p>
<h3 id="supported-playstyles">Supported Playstyles</h3>
<p>The system flexibly supports different ways to play. Most groups
blend multiple styles, but understanding these approaches helps you
communicate preferences and choose the right tools for your table.</p>
<h4 id="activity-based-styles">Activity-Based Styles</h4>
<p><strong>Combat-Focused Play</strong>: Tactical encounters with
meaningful terrain, positioning, and dynamic actions. Each fight creates
choices and escalation. You’ll care about the battlefield’s tags
(environmental descriptors like “Elevated,” “Fragile Cover,” “Cramped”),
your position relative to allies and enemies, and the tactical options
available each turn.</p>
<p><strong>Investigation-Heavy Play</strong>: Clue gathering, deduction,
and problem-solving. Progress clocks track your investigative leads.
Partial successes reveal information with complications—you find the
evidence but alert the conspirators, or learn a crucial fact but
misinterpret its significance.</p>
<p><strong>Social Intrigue</strong>: Negotiation, deception,
relationship management, and political maneuvering. Social contests
resolve conflicting goals. Reputation and leverage matter as much as
combat prowess.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration</strong>: Discovery, navigation, and survival.
Momentum mechanics keep pacing tight while still capturing the sense of
journey and the dangers of unknown territory.</p>
<h4 id="time-commitment-styles">Time Commitment Styles</h4>
<p><strong>Casual Play</strong> (2-3 hours monthly): You want quick
setup, low prep, and satisfying progress even with irregular sessions.
The system supports this through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast character creation</strong>: Use archetypes (Chapter
20) for ready-to-play characters in 10 minutes. No optimization
anxiety—archetypes are balanced and functional out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>Session-based advancement</strong>: Progress every 3-4
sessions regardless of narrative pacing, so irregular attendance doesn’t
stall growth.</li>
<li><strong>Episodic structure</strong>: Self-contained scenarios let
you miss sessions without losing narrative thread. Each session resolves
its core conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal bookkeeping</strong>: No encumbrance, ration
tracking, or detailed inventory management. Focus on story, not
spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weekend Play</strong> (3-4 hours weekly): Standard campaign
pacing. Most content in this guide assumes weekly play. You’ll build
deeper character arcs, engage with longer story threads, and have time
for downtime activities between adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Hardcore/Marathon Play</strong> (6+ hours, multiple sessions
per week): You want depth, complexity, and optimization. The system
rewards this through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimization paths</strong>: Build synergies between skills,
proficiencies, and tactics (see Chapter 04 for build guidance).</li>
<li><strong>Complex scenarios</strong>: The advanced combat and social
examples (Chapters 06-07) provide templates for intricate tactical
situations.</li>
<li><strong>Interconnected arcs</strong>: Multiple progress clocks
tracking simultaneous goals let you juggle faction relationships,
personal quests, and campaign objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Downtime depth</strong>: Use downtime activities (Chapter
12) to pursue side projects, build influence, and develop your character
between adventures.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="player-count-styles">Player Count Styles</h4>
<p><strong>Solo Play</strong> (1 player, no GM): You’re the player and
referee simultaneously. The system provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oracle mechanics</strong>: Use the Solo Play tools (Chapter
12: Alternative Play Modes) to answer questions when uncertain. “Does
the guard notice me?” Roll dice, consult tables, interpret results.</li>
<li><strong>NPC behavior tables</strong>: Simple/medium/complex enemy
behavior generators help you adjudicate opponent actions fairly without
GM bias.</li>
<li><strong>Scene structure</strong>: Frameworks for pacing solo
sessions—exploration beats, action beats, resolution beats—keep
narrative momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Self-sufficient builds</strong>: Character archetypes
flagged for solo viability balance offense, defense, and utility so you
can handle diverse challenges alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solo play works best with lower stakes (investigation, personal
goals) than epic group campaigns. You’re writing interactive fiction
more than traditional TTRPG play.</p>
<p><strong>Duet Play</strong> (1 GM + 1 player): Intimate,
character-focused stories with deeper relationships and personal stakes.
See Chapter 12 for character design, pacing adjustments, and companion
NPC guidance.</p>
<p><strong>GM-less Play</strong> (rotating authority): Distribute GMing
responsibilities across all players using structured turn-taking and
collaborative adjudication. See Chapter 12 for authority rotation models
and tools.</p>
<p><strong>Online Play</strong> (virtual tabletops or voice chat): Play
remotely using digital tools. Requires adapted communication, pacing,
and technical setup. See Chapter 12 for platform choices, best
practices, and common pitfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Group</strong> (1 GM, 3-5 players): The sweet spot
for this system. Party composition balances naturally—you don’t need
rigid roles (tank, healer, DPS). Overlap in capabilities creates
interesting tactical choices rather than redundancy.</p>
<p><strong>Large Group</strong> (1 GM, 6+ players): Possible but
challenging. The GM needs strong spotlight management. Popcorn
initiative (each player names the next to act) prevents alpha players
from dominating. Keep encounters dynamic—static fights with 6+ players
drag unless environmental pressure (spreading fire, collapsing
structure) forces urgency.</p>
<h4 id="engagement-intensity-styles">Engagement Intensity Styles</h4>
<p><strong>Optimization-Focused</strong> (theorycrafting, build
synergies): You love maximizing effectiveness. The system rewards this
through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill synergies</strong>: Combine complementary skills for
advantage (Stealth + Subterfuge for infiltration).</li>
<li><strong>Proficiency stacking</strong>: Select proficiencies that
compound effectiveness in your specialty.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical positioning</strong>: Mastering terrain tags,
flanking, and environmental effects gives significant advantages in
combat.</li>
<li><strong>Build archetypes</strong>: Chapter 04 provides optimization
paths (Tactician, Social Manipulator, Technical Specialist) with worked
progression examples.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Narrative-Focused</strong> (story, character arcs, drama):
You prioritize compelling fiction over mechanical optimization. The
system supports this through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaningful outcomes</strong>: Partial successes create
dramatic complications, not just binary pass/fail.</li>
<li><strong>Fiction-first resolution</strong>: The GM adjudicates based
on your described approach, not rigid skill lists.</li>
<li><strong>Character progression tied to arcs</strong>: Advancement
reflects narrative change (Chapter 04), not grinding XP.</li>
<li><strong>Thematic choices</strong>: Mechanics support choosing “what
my character would do” over “what’s tactically optimal.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balanced</strong> (both mechanics and story): Most tables
blend optimization and narrative focus. Build mechanically effective
characters, then make thematically appropriate choices during play. The
system doesn’t force you to choose between effectiveness and drama—you
can have both.</p>
<p>The GM tailors scenes to your group’s interests. Don’t feel locked
into one style—most campaigns naturally blend multiple approaches as the
story develops.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-game-is-not">What This Game Is Not</h3>
<p>Setting expectations helps avoid frustration. This system prioritizes
certain design goals, which means deliberately excluding others:</p>
<p><strong>Not Granular Simulation</strong>: The game doesn’t track
detailed inventory weights, precise economics, complex physics, or
minute-by-minute timekeeping. If you love calculating encumbrance and
managing rations, this system will feel loose. We prioritize narrative
momentum over simulationist detail.</p>
<p><strong>Not Zero-to-Hero Progression</strong>: Characters are
competent from session one. You’re not playing a helpless apprentice who
spends twenty sessions becoming capable. Progression focuses on
narrative arcs, new capabilities, and expanding your character’s
influence rather than grinding stat increases.</p>
<p><strong>Not GM-vs-Players</strong>: The GM facilitates and
adjudicates, but everyone collaborates. The GM’s goal isn’t to “beat”
the players or protect their meticulously planned plot. Instead, they
frame interesting situations, present meaningful challenges, and
interpret outcomes fairly. If your group prefers adversarial play, this
system will frustrate those expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Not Combat-Only</strong>: While the system handles tactical
combat well, it gives equal mechanical support to social contests,
investigative progress, exploration challenges, and downtime activities.
If you only care about optimized combat builds, you’ll find plenty of
depth—but you’ll also encounter robust systems for non-combat play.</p>
<h2 id="your-core-responsibilities">Your Core Responsibilities as a
Player</h2>
<p>Understanding what you bring to the table helps everyone collaborate
effectively. As a player, you have three primary responsibilities:</p>
<h3 id="engaged-choices">Engaged Choices</h3>
<p>Make decisions that matter. Don’t wait for the GM to prompt you—drive
your character forward. When the GM describes a situation, consider what
your character would do and declare it. “I want to check the room for
traps” beats silence or passively waiting for instructions.</p>
<p>Engaged choices mean: - <strong>Declaring actions with clear
intent</strong>: Tell the GM what you’re trying to accomplish, not just
what dice to roll. - <strong>Taking initiative</strong>: When scenes
feel static, push them forward. Investigate the suspicious detail,
confront the evasive NPC, or propose a risky plan. - <strong>Embracing
consequences</strong>: Accept outcomes, even unfavorable ones. Roll with
failures and complications rather than arguing for do-overs. -
<strong>Making thematic choices</strong>: Sometimes the dramatically
appropriate choice isn’t the tactically optimal one. That’s
okay—compelling stories emerge from characters making choices true to
who they are.</p>
<h3 id="clear-intent">Clear Intent</h3>
<p>When you declare an action, communicate your goal and approach. “I
want to sneak past the guard using the shadows near the pillars” is
vastly more useful than “I roll stealth.”</p>
<p>Clear intent allows the GM to: - <strong>Set appropriate DCs</strong>
based on your approach and the situation - <strong>Grant advantage or
disadvantage</strong> based on your chosen method - <strong>Frame
meaningful stakes</strong> for what happens on different outcomes -
<strong>Interpret results narratively</strong> in ways that connect to
your goal</p>
<p>Example of clear vs. unclear intent:</p>
<p><strong>Unclear</strong>: “I want to persuade the merchant.”</p>
<p><strong>Clear</strong>: “I want to convince the merchant to give us a
discount by appealing to her greed—mentioning we’ll be repeat customers
if the price is right and subtly implying we have lucrative
connections.”</p>
<p>The clear version gives the GM everything they need to adjudicate the
action fairly and narrate a compelling outcome.</p>
<h3 id="collaborative-problem-solving">Collaborative
Problem-Solving</h3>
<p>Work with your group. Share the spotlight. Build on each other’s
ideas. If someone’s stuck, offer support or create openings for
them.</p>
<p>Collaborative problem-solving looks like: - <strong>Supporting other
characters’ actions</strong>: When a teammate creates an opportunity,
take it. “While she distracts the guard, I’ll slip through the side
entrance.” - <strong>Offering tactical assistance</strong>: Set up
allies for success. “I’ll pin the enemy down with covering fire so you
can flank them.” - <strong>Contributing to group planning</strong>:
Share your character’s expertise and perspective during discussions.
Don’t dominate, but don’t stay silent either. - <strong>Rotating
spotlight</strong>: If you’ve had several consecutive scenes focused on
your character, create space for others. Ask another player what their
character thinks or does. - <strong>Building on contributions</strong>:
When someone adds a detail to the fiction, accept and expand on it
rather than contradicting or ignoring it.</p>
<h2 id="collaborative-dynamics">Collaborative Dynamics</h2>
<p>Understanding how players and GM work together helps create a
positive table culture.</p>
<h3 id="player-gm-partnership">The Player-GM Partnership</h3>
<p>This game works through player-GM collaboration, not opposition. The
GM frames situations and adjudicates outcomes. You describe actions and
face consequences. Together, you create compelling stories.</p>
<p>The GM’s role: - <strong>Frame situations</strong> with interesting
challenges and meaningful choices - <strong>Adjudicate outcomes</strong>
fairly based on the fiction and mechanics - <strong>Portray the
world</strong> and its NPCs with consistency and depth -
<strong>Maintain pace</strong> by knowing when to zoom in for detail and
when to summarize - <strong>Support player agency</strong> by respecting
their choices and building on their contributions</p>
<p>Your role: - <strong>Drive action</strong> through your character’s
choices - <strong>Engage with the world</strong> by asking questions and
investigating details - <strong>Accept outcomes</strong> gracefully,
even when they complicate your plans - <strong>Collaborate</strong> with
other players to create satisfying group dynamics -
<strong>Communicate</strong> your preferences, comfort levels, and
character goals</p>
<p>Neither role is subordinate. You need each other to make the game
work.</p>
<h3 id="safety-and-consent">Safety and Consent</h3>
<p>Tabletop roleplaying can explore intense themes, but it should always
feel safe for everyone at the table. Use safety tools to ensure comfort
and respect everyone’s boundaries without question.</p>
<p><strong>X-Card</strong>: The X-Card is a simple tool anyone can use
at any time to say “I’m not comfortable with this content.” How it
works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place an index card marked with an “X” in the center of the table
(or use a digital equivalent in online play)</li>
<li>Anyone can tap or reference the X-Card when content makes them
uncomfortable</li>
<li>When the X-Card is used, immediately stop the current content. No
questions asked. No explanation required.</li>
<li>The GM either rewinds the scene to before the uncomfortable content
or fast-forwards past it</li>
<li>The game continues without discussing what prompted the X-Card use
unless the person who used it wants to discuss it privately</li>
</ul>
<p>The X-Card creates safety because it requires zero justification. You
don’t need a “good enough” reason. Your discomfort is reason enough.</p>
<p><strong>Lines and Veils</strong>: Lines and Veils establish content
boundaries before play begins:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines</strong> are hard boundaries—content that won’t appear
in the game at all. Examples: sexual violence, harm to children, graphic
torture, specific phobias.</li>
<li><strong>Veils</strong> are content that can exist in the game world
but “fades to black” rather than being described in detail. Examples:
sexual content (it happens off-screen), violence (described in outcome
but not gory detail), substance abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Establish Lines and Veils during Session Zero (the first session
where you discuss expectations rather than playing). Write them down.
Respect them absolutely. Lines and Veils can be added or modified during
play if someone realizes additional boundaries are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Check-Ins</strong>: Especially when playing intense or
emotionally challenging content, periodic check-ins help maintain
safety:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GM can pause between scenes to ask “Everyone good to
continue?”</li>
<li>Players can request a brief break if they need to decompress</li>
<li>After sessions with particularly intense content, debrief as a
group</li>
</ul>
<p>Safety tools aren’t about censorship or restricting creative
expression. They’re about ensuring everyone can engage with the game
comfortably. A player who feels unsafe can’t engage fully with the
story.</p>
<h3 id="reading-the-table">Reading the Table</h3>
<p>Pay attention to your group’s energy and adjust accordingly:</p>
<p><strong>When someone’s disengaged</strong>: Create space for them.
Ask their character what they think or do. Set up an opportunity that
plays to their character’s strengths.</p>
<p><strong>When tension’s high</strong>: Offer levity or a moment to
breathe. Sometimes a joke, a brief aside, or a shift in scene tone
helps.</p>
<p><strong>When pacing drags</strong>: Push forward. Declare a bold
action. Force a decision. Ask the GM a pointed question that demands
resolution.</p>
<p><strong>When someone’s uncomfortable</strong>: Even without an
explicit X-Card use, watch for body language, disengagement, or visible
discomfort. It’s okay to privately check in with someone during a
break.</p>
<p>Reading the table is a skill that develops with practice and
attention. Start by simply paying attention to others’ faces and
engagement levels.</p>
<h3 id="yes-and">Building Fiction Through “Yes, And”</h3>
<p>Fiction at the table builds through <strong>acceptance and
addition</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Accept what’s established</strong>: If the GM says the
hallway’s dark, it is. If another player’s character is cautious,
respect that. Don’t contradict established facts unless the group
explicitly embraces collaborative world-building where players
contribute setting details.</p>
<p><strong>Add meaningful details</strong>: Enrich scenes through your
contributions. “I notice scorch marks on the walls” adds texture. “I
draw my blade quietly” shows your approach. These details give the GM
material to build on.</p>
<p><strong>Support others’ contributions</strong>: When someone creates
an opportunity—“I distract the guard”—take it. “I slip past while
they’re focused on you” builds momentum. When a player adds a detail
about their character’s backstory or motivation, incorporate it into
your character’s perspective.</p>
<p>“Yes, and” builds momentum. “No, but” stops it. Even when characters
disagree, you as players should be adding to each other’s contributions
rather than negating them.</p>
<p>Example of “Yes, And” in action:</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “The noble’s study is lavishly decorated.
Expensive art on the walls, thick rugs, a desk made of imported
wood.”</p>
<p><strong>Player 1</strong>: “I notice the desk has a hidden
compartment—there’s a slight seam in the wood grain that doesn’t
match.”</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “Yes, and when you examine it closely, you smell
a faint chemical odor from that seam. Something was recently placed in
or removed from that compartment.”</p>
<p><strong>Player 2</strong>: “I recognize that smell—it’s Serpent’s
Breath, a rare poison. My character dealt with it once before.”</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “Yes, and that memory reminds you: Serpent’s
Breath only remains potent for about six hours after exposure to air.
Whatever was poisoned is recently gone.”</p>
<p>Each contribution builds on the previous one, enriching the scene and
creating narrative momentum.</p>

let’s dig into how the rules actually work.</h2>

<h1 id="ph-how-to-read-the-rules">How to Read the Rules</h1>
<p>Understanding the rules means understanding how uncertainty resolves
at the table. When you declare an action with an uncertain outcome, you
roll dice. The result determines not just whether you succeed, but how
the fiction changes in response. This chapter breaks down the core
mechanical framework: how dice work, what DCs mean, how outcomes shape
the story, and how the environment affects your actions.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-dice">Rolling Dice</h2>
<p>This game uses <strong>4d6</strong> (four six-sided dice) as its core
resolution mechanic. When the GM calls for a check, you roll 4d6, sum
all the dice, add your relevant bonus, and compare the total to a
Difficulty Class (DC) set by the GM.</p>
<h3 id="basic-roll">The Basic Roll</h3>
<p>Here’s how a check works:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Declare your action</strong> with clear intent: what you’re
trying to accomplish and how</li>
<li><strong>GM sets the DC</strong> based on the fiction: how difficult
is this given the circumstances?</li>
<li><strong>Roll 4d6</strong> and sum all four dice</li>
<li><strong>Add your bonus</strong> from your relevant attribute or
skill</li>
<li><strong>Compare to the DC</strong>: your total determines your
outcome tier</li>
<li><strong>Calculate margin</strong>: subtract the DC from your total
(Roll - DC = Margin)</li>
<li><strong>Interpret the result</strong>: your margin determines how
well or poorly you did</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You’re trying to climb a wall under
pressure. The GM sets DC 16 (Tough—it’s slippery and time is short). You
have +3 from your AGI attribute. You roll 4d6 and get 3, 5, 4, 6 = 18.
Add your +3 bonus = 21 total. Your margin is 21 - 16 = +5, which is a
Critical Success—you not only climb quickly, but you find a secure
position that gives you advantage on your next action.</p>
<h3 id="key-statistics">Key Statistics</h3>
<p>Understanding the dice helps you assess risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average roll</strong>: 14 (before bonuses)</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 4 to 24 (before bonuses)</li>
<li><strong>Distribution</strong>: Bell curve centered on 14. Most rolls
cluster near the average. Extremes (very low or very high) are rare but
possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>This bell curve means: - Routine tasks (DC 12-14) are likely to
succeed if you have any positive bonus - Tough challenges (DC 16-18)
require good rolls or favorable circumstances - Legendary tasks (DC 22)
demand both skill and luck</p>
<h3 id="dice-notation">Dice Notation</h3>
<p>You’ll see dice notation throughout the rules: - <strong>4d6</strong>
means “roll four six-sided dice and sum them” - <strong>d6</strong>
means “a single six-sided die” - <strong>2d6</strong> means “roll two
six-sided dice and add them together”</p>
<p>When you see “roll 4d6 + bonus,” that’s the core resolution mechanic.
Nearly everything in this game uses that same foundation.</p>
<h3 id="advantage-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
<p>Sometimes circumstances tilt in your favor (or against you). Instead
of adjusting the DC, the game uses <strong>advantage</strong> and
<strong>disadvantage</strong> to modify your dice pool:</p>
<p><strong>Advantage</strong> means you roll extra dice and keep the
best 4: - <strong>+1 Advantage</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep the best 4 dice
- <strong>+2 Advantage</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep the best 4 dice</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong> means you roll extra dice and keep the
worst 4: - <strong>-1 Disadvantage</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep the worst 4
dice - <strong>-2 Disadvantage</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep the worst 4
dice</p>
<p><strong>Stacking</strong>: Multiple sources of advantage or
disadvantage don’t stack beyond ±2 levels. If you have both advantage
and disadvantage, they cancel out—net them (e.g., +1 advantage and -1
disadvantage = roll normally with 4d6).</p>
<p><strong>When do you get advantage or disadvantage?</strong> The GM
grants these based on the fiction: - <strong>Advantage</strong>:
Favorable positioning (elevated ground), superior tools (masterwork
lockpicks), helpful circumstances (enemy distracted), or supportive tags
(Dim Light when sneaking) - <strong>Disadvantage</strong>: Poor
positioning (cramped space), inadequate tools (improvised weapon),
hindering circumstances (wounded), or hostile tags (Slick floor when
climbing)</p>
<p><strong>Example (Advantage)</strong>: You’re tracking someone through
fresh mud (+1 advantage from favorable circumstances). You roll 5d6: 2,
4, 5, 3, 6. You keep the best 4: 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Add your +2 Survival
bonus = 20 total against DC 16. Margin +4, a strong Full Success.</p>
<p><strong>Example (Disadvantage)</strong>: You’re climbing a slick wall
(-1 disadvantage from the Slick tag). You roll 5d6: 2, 4, 5, 3, 6. You
keep the worst 4: 2, 3, 4, 5 = 14. Add your +3 Athletics bonus = 17
total against DC 16. Margin +1, a narrow Full Success—you make it, but
barely.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-dcs">Understanding DCs</h2>
<p>When you declare an action with uncertain outcome, the GM sets a
<strong>Difficulty Class (DC)</strong>—the target number you need to
meet or exceed. The DC comes from the fiction: it reflects risk,
opposition, tools, positioning, and time pressure.</p>
<p>Here’s what each DC tier means in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC 12 (Easy):</strong> You have good position, adequate
time, and proper tools. This might still matter because of what happens
if you fail, but success is likely for anyone competent.
<ul>
<li>Example: Picking a simple lock with proper tools and no
pressure</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DC 14 (Routine):</strong> Standard challenge under normal
conditions. If you’re trained and have a moment to focus, you’ll usually
succeed.
<ul>
<li>Example: Persuading a neutral merchant, climbing a wall with
handholds</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DC 16 (Tough):</strong> Notable obstacles, poor angle, or
time pressure. You’ll need skill or favorable circumstances to reliably
succeed.
<ul>
<li>Example: Disabling a trap while guards approach, navigating through
a storm</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DC 18 (Hard):</strong> Steep odds, strong opposition, or
tight timing. Even skilled characters face real risk of failure.
<ul>
<li>Example: Treating an exotic poison, infiltrating a heavily guarded
facility</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DC 20 (Heroic):</strong> Exceptional challenge with
complications stacked against you. Success requires both skill and luck
(or advantage from setup).
<ul>
<li>Example: Tracking through a blizzard, convincing a hostile
crowd</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DC 22 (Legendary):</strong> Near-impossible without perfect
setup, significant advantage, or extraordinary luck. The GM should
rarely set DCs this high—most “impossible” tasks shouldn’t have a roll
at all.
<ul>
<li>Example: Predicting a rare celestial event, disarming an ancient
magical mechanism</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The GM sets DCs based on circumstances, not your character’s
ability.</strong> Your bonuses represent your skill. The DC represents
the task’s inherent difficulty given the situation. A DC 16 lock doesn’t
become DC 14 because you’re good at lockpicking—instead, you’re more
likely to beat DC 16 because of your bonus.</p>
<h2 id="outcome-tiers">Outcome Tiers</h2>
<p>Your margin (Roll - DC) determines how well or poorly you did. The
game has five outcome tiers:</p>
<h3 id="critical-success">Critical Success (Margin ≥ +5)</h3>
<p>You succeed spectacularly with extra benefit. Not only do you achieve
your goal, you gain something additional: extra information, improved
position, a cleared obstacle, or narrative advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Picking a lock: You open it silently,
find a hidden compartment, and recognize the maker’s mark - Persuading
an NPC: They agree enthusiastically and offer to do more than you asked
- Combat attack: You deal damage and create an opening for an ally or
knock the enemy off balance</p>
<h3 id="full-success">Full Success (Margin ≥ 0)</h3>
<p>You achieve your goal cleanly. Progress ticks, you gain position, or
you clear an obstacle. This is the default “success” outcome—you did
what you set out to do without complication.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Picking a lock: You open it efficiently
and enter - Persuading an NPC: They agree to your request - Combat
attack: You deal damage as intended</p>
<h3 id="partial-success">Partial Success (Margin -1 to -2)</h3>
<p>You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect. The GM
typically pre-states what the cost might be before you roll: “You can
leap the gap, but you’ll land hard and take the Winded condition” or
“You convince the guard, but she’ll want a favor later.”</p>
<p>Partials keep the story moving forward while maintaining tension. You
make progress, but the situation gets more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Picking a lock (Partial): You open it,
but your tools break or the mechanism jams—you’re getting through, but
you can’t lock it behind you - Persuading an NPC (Partial): They agree,
but demand immediate payment or an uncomfortable compromise - Combat
attack (Partial): You deal reduced damage or the enemy
counterattacks</p>
<h3 id="failure">Failure (Margin ≤ -3)</h3>
<p>You don’t achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. The GM
introduces a new obstacle, escalates danger, or fills a pressure clock.
Failures move the story forward—they change what happens next rather
than stalling play.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Picking a lock (Failure): The lock stays
shut and you hear footsteps approaching—the guards are coming -
Persuading an NPC (Failure): They refuse and grow suspicious of your
motives - Combat attack (Failure): You miss and leave yourself exposed,
or the enemy seizes the initiative</p>
<h3 id="critical-failure">Critical Failure (Margin ≤ -7 or all 1s)</h3>
<p>A disaster occurs—the worst possible result with major complications.
The GM amplifies the failure: things break, attention is drawn, or
dangerous consequences land immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Special Rule</strong>: Rolling all 1s (1, 1, 1, 1) is always
a Critical Failure regardless of bonuses or margin. Even the most
skilled character can have catastrophically bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Picking a lock (Critical Failure): Your
pick breaks off in the lock, jamming it permanently, and the noise
alerts nearby guards - Persuading an NPC (Critical Failure): They take
offense and call for security, or spread damaging rumors about you -
Combat attack (Critical Failure): You drop your weapon, hurt yourself,
or create an opening the enemy exploits viciously</p>
<h3 id="reading-results">Reading Results in Play</h3>
<p>The GM interprets your margin into fiction. A margin of +8 isn’t just
“you rolled high”—it’s “you pick the lock silently, find a hidden
compartment, and have time to search it before anyone notices.” The
better your margin, the more favorable the outcome.</p>
<p>Similarly, a margin of -5 isn’t just “you missed the DC”—it’s “you
make noise, the patrol rounds the corner, and you have seconds to
decide: run, hide, or talk fast?”</p>
<p>Margins translate mechanical results into narrative consequences.
Every roll shapes what happens next.</p>
<h2 id="tags--conditions">Tags &amp; Conditions</h2>
<p>Tags and Conditions describe how the world and your character work
right now. They’re visible state that everyone can see and
reference.</p>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p><strong>Tags</strong> describe environments or temporary situational
states. The GM names 1–2 meaningful tags per scene and makes their
effects explicit.</p>
<p>Common tags include: - <strong>Environmental</strong>: <em>Dim
Light</em>, <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Elevated</em>, <em>Obscured</em>,
<em>Slick</em> - <strong>Situational</strong>: <em>Fragile Cover</em>,
<em>Hazardous</em>, <em>Crowded</em>, <em>Unstable</em></p>
<p>Tags grant advantage or disadvantage based on how you interact with
them: - <em>Dim Light</em> gives advantage to Stealth, disadvantage to
ranged attacks - <em>Elevated</em> gives advantage to ranged attacks
from above - <em>Slick</em> imposes disadvantage on movement and balance
checks</p>
<p>You can create, change, or clear tags through actions: - “I kick over
the brazier to create Thick Smoke” - “I spend my turn clearing rubble to
remove the Obstructed tag” - “I use an action to stabilize the Unstable
scaffolding”</p>
<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Conditions</strong> describe what’s happening to your
character right now. They change your capabilities—imposing
disadvantage, reducing movement, or preventing certain actions.</p>
<p>Common conditions include: - <em>Exhausted</em>: Disadvantage on
physical actions, reduced movement - <em>Restrained</em>: Movement
severely limited, disadvantage on physical actions requiring mobility -
<em>Bleeding</em>: Time pressure—the condition worsens if not treated -
<em>Dazed</em>: Disadvantage on perception and reaction checks -
<em>Frightened</em>: Disadvantage on actions while the threat is
visible</p>
<p>When the GM applies a condition, they explain: - <strong>What it
does</strong>: How it affects your capabilities - <strong>How to clear
it</strong>: What actions or resources remove it (first aid, rest,
tactics, removing the source)</p>
<p>Conditions have clear mechanical effects and clear resolution paths.
You’re never stuck with a condition you can’t eventually address.</p>
<h2 id="clocks--progress">Clocks &amp; Progress</h2>
<p>Clocks track momentum—yours and the opposition’s. They’re circles
divided into segments (usually 4, 6, or 8) that fill as actions succeed
or fail. The GM shows clocks when they matter, making stakes
visible.</p>
<h3 id="progress-clocks">Progress Clocks</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Clocks</strong> track your goals: escaping the ruin,
convincing the council, disarming the ritual, investigating the
mystery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Successes tick progress (usually 1 segment)</li>
<li>Critical Successes tick more progress (usually 2 segments)</li>
<li>Partial Successes might tick progress with a cost</li>
<li>Failures don’t tick progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Fill the clock completely, you achieve the goal. Progress Clocks show
how close you are to success and help pace extended challenges.</p>
<h3 id="pressure-clocks">Pressure Clocks</h3>
<p><strong>Pressure Clocks</strong> track escalating danger: guards
arriving, fire spreading, poison taking hold, enemy reinforcements,
ritual completion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Failures tick pressure (as pre-stated by the GM)</li>
<li>Partial Successes often tick pressure (as pre-stated)</li>
<li>Full Successes usually don’t tick pressure</li>
</ul>
<p>Fill the pressure clock completely, the complication lands: guards
arrive, the building collapses, the poison reaches lethal toxicity, the
enemy’s plan succeeds.</p>
<h3 id="clocks-together">How Clocks Work Together</h3>
<p>Most interesting scenes have both clocks running simultaneously.
You’re racing to fill your Progress Clock before the Pressure Clock
fills. Each roll matters because it affects both clocks differently
depending on the outcome.</p>
<p>The GM typically uses paired clocks for: - Chases (Progress: Escape;
Pressure: Caught) - Investigations (Progress: Solve Mystery; Pressure:
Conspiracy Realizes You’re Investigating) - Infiltrations (Progress:
Reach Objective; Pressure: Security Alert Level) - Disasters (Progress:
Escape Building; Pressure: Structure Collapse)</p>
<p>Clocks make stakes visceral. You see progress accumulating and
pressure building in real time.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Design Philosophy: Why Clocks Work</strong></p>
<p>Clocks create <strong>visible tension</strong>. Traditional TTRPGs
often hide progress (“how many more clues do we need?”) and threats
(“when will reinforcements arrive?”). This creates uncertainty, but it
also breeds frustration—players can’t gauge pacing or make informed
choices.</p>
<p>Clocks solve this by making progress and danger
<strong>transparent</strong>. You see exactly how close you are to
success (Progress Clock filling) and how much time you have (Pressure
Clock ticking). This creates informed urgency: “We’re at 3/6 progress,
but pressure is 2/4—do we push forward or retreat?”</p>
<p>Psychologically, filling segments is <strong>satisfying</strong>.
Each tick forward feels like meaningful progress, even when the goal is
distant. Partial successes that tick progress with a cost become
interesting trade-offs, not just failures. You’re always moving the
story forward—either toward success or toward complication.</p>
<p>From a GM perspective, clocks eliminate arbitrary time tracking.
Instead of “the guards arrive whenever I feel like it,” the GM has a
clear framework: “Failures and Partial Successes tick pressure.” This
keeps pacing consistent and fair. Players trust that the world responds
to their actions, not GM fiat.</p>
<p><strong>In tactical terms</strong>: Clocks reward decisive action.
Stalling doesn’t stop pressure clocks from filling. Taking risks
(accepting Partial Success) at least advances progress. The game pushes
you forward, creating momentum even in uncertain situations.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="worked-example">Worked Example</h2>
<p>Let’s see all these concepts working together in a complete
scene:</p>
<p><strong>Setup</strong>: You’re sneaking through a manor’s hallway to
reach the study before guards return. The GM establishes: -
<strong>Tag</strong>: <em>Dim Light</em> (advantage to Stealth,
disadvantage to seeing details) - <strong>Pressure Clock</strong>:
“Guard Patrol Returns” (4 segments, currently 2/4 filled) -
<strong>Goal</strong>: Reach the study and find the incriminating
ledger</p>
<h3 id="scene-play">Scene Play</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “The hallway’s dim—sconces burn low. You hear
boots echoing two rooms away. The study door is ahead, maybe thirty
feet. The patrol’s getting close. What do you do?”</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>: “I move quickly but quietly, using the shadows
along the wall. I want to reach the study before they round the
corner.”</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “Stealth check, DC 14. The Dim Light tag gives
you +1 advantage (roll 5d6, keep best 4). If you succeed, you reach the
study. Partial means you make it but knock something over—I’ll tick
pressure. Failure means they spot you or you have to freeze and waste
time—I’ll tick pressure and you won’t make progress.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 5d6 with advantage</strong>: 2, 4, 5, 3, 6. Keep
best 4: 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Add your +2 Stealth bonus = 20 total. Margin:
20 - 14 = <strong>+6 (Critical Success)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “You slip into the study silently, pulling the
door almost closed behind you. The patrol passes in the hallway,
completely oblivious. You even had time to notice a loose floorboard
near the desk—might be useful.” (No pressure tick; you gained a tactical
detail from the critical success)</p>
<p><strong>Inside the study, you search for the ledger:</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “Papers everywhere, files stacked haphazardly.
This is going to take time you might not have. Let’s use a Progress
Clock: ‘Find Ledger’ (4 segments). Each success ticks progress. The
guard patrol is doing their rounds—they’ll eventually circle back. DC 16
for the search—tough because of the disorganization and time
pressure.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 4d6</strong>: 3, 3, 4, 4 = 14. Add your +2
Investigation bonus = 16 total. Margin: 16 - 16 = <strong>+0 (Full
Success)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “You systematically check the desk drawers.
Third one down, you find a ledger with recent entries. Tick progress
(1/4 segments filled). As you’re examining it, you hear a door creak
downstairs. The patrol’s still moving. What do you do?”</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>: “I want to photograph the key pages quickly
with my phone, then put it back so they don’t know I was here.”</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “DC 14 to do it fast and accurately. Partial
means you get the photos but smudge ink or leave the desk obviously
disturbed—tick pressure. Failure means you fumble with the phone and
definitely alert them—tick pressure and no progress.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 4d6</strong>: 2, 2, 5, 3 = 12. Add your +1 bonus =
13 total. Margin: 13 - 14 = <strong>-1 (Partial Success)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: “You snap photos of three key pages, but in your
haste you knock over an inkwell on the desk. It’s obvious someone was
here. Tick progress (2/4 on Find Ledger) and tick pressure (3/4 on Guard
Patrol). You hear footsteps on the stairs now—they’re coming up. You
have the photos, but they’ll know there was an intruder. What’s your
move?”</p>
<p>The scene continues. Each roll shaped the fiction: Critical Success
gave you a clean entry and a bonus detail. Full Success made progress.
Partial Success gave progress with a complication. Tags affected your
rolls (Dim Light advantage). Clocks made the pressure visible and
escalating.</p>
<p>That’s how the rules work in play: dice determine outcomes, margins
shape how good or bad those outcomes are, and everything feeds back into
the fiction to create the next situation.</p>

<p>Creating a character means building three interlocking layers:
<strong>concept</strong> (who they are and what makes them compelling),
<strong>mechanical framework</strong> (what they can do and how they
engage with the game’s systems), and <strong>narrative hooks</strong>
(why they matter to the story and what pulls them into the action). This
chapter walks you through that process step by step, with concrete
examples and guidance for creating characters that feel both
mechanically competent and dramatically engaging.</p>
<p>Character creation is fundamentally a collaborative act. You’re not
building a character in isolation—you’re creating someone who will
interact with other PCs, engage with the GM’s world, and drive stories
forward through their choices. Before you dive into mechanics, talk with
your GM and fellow players about the campaign’s themes, tone, and
setting. Discuss what kind of stories your group wants to tell. A
character built for gritty survival horror won’t mesh well with a group
playing heroic adventure fantasy. Alignment on expectations creates
richer, more satisfying play.</p>
<p>Think of character creation as building the foundation for a living,
evolving person. You’re not writing their entire biography—you’re
establishing who they are <em>at the start</em> of the campaign. Play
will reveal depths, contradictions, and growth you can’t predict now.
Start with a clear, evocative core and let the character develop through
actual decisions at the table.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-concept--attributes">Step 1: Concept &amp;
Attributes</h2>
<p>Start with <strong>concept</strong>: a short, evocative description
of who this character is, what they do, and what drives them. Think in
terms of character archetypes and roles, but give yours a specific twist
or detail that makes them yours.</p>
<p><strong>Good concepts</strong> are specific and actionable: - “A
street-smart investigator haunted by her missing partner” - “A grizzled
mercenary trying to retire peacefully but pulled back by old debts” - “A
brilliant but naive scholar uncovering secrets that powerful people want
buried”</p>
<p><strong>Weak concepts</strong> are vague or passive: - “A fighter”
(what kind? what motivates them?) - “Someone who wants adventure” (too
broad, no dramatic tension) - “A person with magic powers” (no
personality, no conflict)</p>
<p>Your concept should immediately suggest narrative possibilities. When
you describe your character, the GM and other players should instantly
see story hooks—relationships to build, conflicts to explore, goals to
pursue.</p>
<p>Once you have your concept, translate it into
<strong>attributes</strong>. Attributes are the four core capabilities
that define your character’s baseline competencies:</p>
<p><strong>MIG (Might):</strong> Physical power, endurance, and
resilience. Might governs lifting, smashing, enduring physical hardship,
and resisting bodily harm. High Might characters are physically
imposing—warriors, laborers, athletes, brawlers.</p>
<p><strong>AGI (Agility):</strong> Speed, precision, and reflexes.
Agility governs dodging, climbing, shooting, sleight of hand, and any
action requiring finesse or quick reactions. High Agility characters are
nimble and coordinated—thieves, scouts, duelists, acrobats.</p>
<p><strong>RSN (Reason):</strong> Logic, knowledge, perception, and
analytical thinking. Reason governs analyzing evidence, recalling
information, noticing details, and solving problems through intellect.
High Reason characters are sharp-minded—scholars, investigators,
engineers, tacticians.</p>
<p><strong>PRE (Presence):</strong> Charisma, willpower, and social
influence. Presence governs persuading, commanding, intimidating, and
resisting mental pressure. High Presence characters are compelling and
forceful—leaders, diplomats, performers, con artists.</p>
<p><strong>Assigning Attribute Bonuses</strong></p>
<p>Your GM will tell you how to assign attribute bonuses. A common
starting array is <strong>+2, +1, +1, +0</strong>—assign these four
values to your four attributes in any order based on your concept.</p>
<p><strong>Example (Kira, the investigator):</strong> - <strong>MIG
+0</strong>: Not physically imposing, relies on other tools -
<strong>AGI +1</strong>: Quick reflexes, good for tailing suspects and
staying mobile - <strong>RSN +2</strong>: Sharp analytical mind, her
primary strength - <strong>PRE +1</strong>: Socially competent, can talk
her way into places</p>
<p>Attributes add directly to your <code>4d6</code> rolls. When you make
a check, you roll <code>4d6</code>, sum all four dice, and add the
relevant attribute bonus. If Kira makes a Deduction check (typically
RSN-based), she rolls <code>4d6+2</code>. If she tries to intimidate
someone (typically PRE-based), she rolls <code>4d6+1</code>.</p>
<p>Higher bonuses make success more likely, but they’re not everything.
A character with +0 in an attribute can still succeed through clever
approaches, environmental advantage, or teamwork. Attributes establish
your baseline, but play reveals how you <em>use</em> those
capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-skills--proficiencies">Step 2: Skills &amp;
Proficiencies</h2>
<p><strong>Skills</strong> define what you’re trained in—the specific
areas where you excel beyond raw attributes. Instead of choosing
individual skills piecemeal, you’ll select a <strong>skill
package</strong> that fits your concept and the campaign’s genre.</p>
<p>Skill packages are thematic bundles designed for specific character
archetypes and settings. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Fantasy Packages:</strong> - <em>Blades &amp; Brawling</em>:
Melee combat, intimidation, physical prowess - <em>Arcane Lore</em>:
Magic theory, ancient languages, mystical perception - <em>Wilderness
Survival</em>: Tracking, foraging, navigation, animal handling</p>
<p><strong>Modern Packages:</strong> - <em>Urban Investigation</em>:
Research, surveillance, deduction, streetwise - <em>Firearms &amp;
Tactics</em>: Shooting, combat tactics, military protocols - <em>Social
Engineering</em>: Persuasion, deception, reading people, networking</p>
<p><strong>Science Fiction Packages:</strong> - <em>Piloting &amp;
Navigation</em>: Starship operation, astrogation, zero-g maneuvering -
<em>Hacking &amp; Systems</em>: Computer intrusion, electronic warfare,
system analysis - <em>Xenobiology</em>: Alien life study, exobotany,
medical xenoscience</p>
<p>Each package gives you bonuses or advantage when using those skills.
Consult your GM or the Mechanics Reference for complete skill lists and
packages appropriate to your campaign’s genre and setting.</p>
<p><strong>Proficiencies</strong> grant narrative permissions and
mechanical edges beyond skills. While skills govern <em>what you’re
trained in</em>, proficiencies define <em>what you can do that others
can’t</em> and <em>special advantages you bring</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Proficiencies:</strong> - <strong>Master
Duelist</strong>: Advantage when fighting one-on-one in melee, narrative
permission to challenge opponents to formal duels -
<strong>Alchemist</strong>: Can craft potions and identify compounds,
narrative permission to have specialized alchemical equipment -
<strong>Polyglot</strong>: Speak and read multiple languages fluently,
advantage on checks involving translation or linguistics - <strong>Tech
Savant</strong>: Advantage when working with unfamiliar technology,
narrative permission to jury-rig improvised devices</p>
<p>You typically start with <strong>2–3 proficiencies</strong> that
enhance your concept. Choose proficiencies that create interesting
narrative opportunities, not just mechanical bonuses. “I’m a Polyglot”
opens doors (literally and figuratively) in a way that pure mechanics
can’t capture.</p>
<p>Skills and proficiencies together define your <strong>fictional
positioning</strong>—what you can attempt, how likely you are to
succeed, and what narrative permissions you have. When you say “I’m
picking the lock,” having Thievery skill means you’re competent. Having
the <em>Master Locksmith</em> proficiency means you can attempt locks
others couldn’t even try.</p>
<h3 id="urban-investigator-at-a-glance">Urban Investigator Skill Package
At-a-Glance</h3>
<p>The <em>Urban Investigation</em> package is built for modern noir
settings—detectives, journalists, fixers, or anyone navigating city
streets, corruption, and crime. It emphasizes information gathering,
risk management, and navigating urban power structures. Here’s how these
skills work together during play and what challenges they’re designed to
handle.</p>
<p><strong>Core Skills:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research (RSN):</strong> Digging through records, archives,
databases, and paper trails to find connections others missed. You’re
assembling timelines, cross-referencing names, identifying patterns in
bureaucratic noise. Research takes time and access—you need either
physical presence at archives or digital access to databases.</p>
<p><em>Typical DCs:</em> - <strong>DC 14</strong>: Standard searches
with good access (public records, library archives, mainstream
databases) - <strong>DC 16</strong>: Information is scattered or
partially redacted (cross-referencing multiple sources, old case files,
obfuscated corporate records) - <strong>DC 18+</strong>: Buried,
protected, or deliberately hidden information (sealed court documents,
encrypted files, scrubbed records)</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> You’re investigating a suspicious death. Research
at DC 14 pulls up the official report—accidental overdose. Research at
DC 16 cross-references pharmacy records and finds the victim never
filled prescriptions for that drug. Research at DC 18+ digs into deleted
financial transactions showing payments to a known fixer the day before
death.</p>
<p><strong>Surveillance (RSN/AGI):</strong> Tailing suspects, staking
out locations, capturing evidence without detection. Surveillance is
patient, methodical work—watching patterns, documenting movements,
identifying contacts. It requires good positioning, the right equipment
(cameras, listening devices), and the discipline to stay invisible.</p>
<p><em>Typical DCs:</em> - <strong>DC 14</strong>: Routine surveillance
in public spaces with good cover (busy streets, cafes with sightlines,
parks with concealment) - <strong>DC 16</strong>: Target is cautious or
environment is challenging (residential areas with few crowds, limited
cover, hostile neighborhoods) - <strong>DC 18+</strong>: Target actively
countersurveillance or environment is hostile (professional criminals,
secure facilities, locations where you stand out)</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> You’re staking out a dockside warehouse. DC 14
surveillance from a nearby rooftop with binoculars captures comings and
goings. DC 16 requires getting closer or working in bad weather—you get
photos but risk exposure. DC 18+ means tailing a target through hostile
territory where locals notice outsiders immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Deduction (RSN):</strong> Connecting clues, identifying
patterns, reading crime scenes, reconstructing events from incomplete
evidence. Deduction is synthesis—taking disparate facts and building
coherent narratives. It’s Sherlock Holmes logic: “When you eliminate the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth.”</p>
<p><em>Typical DCs:</em> - <strong>DC 14</strong>: Straightforward
deductions from clear evidence (timeline reconstruction from witness
statements, identifying obvious inconsistencies) - <strong>DC
16</strong>: Complex patterns requiring multiple data points (profiling
suspects from behavior patterns, identifying connections between
seemingly unrelated events) - <strong>DC 18+</strong>: Incomplete or
contradictory evidence requiring intuitive leaps (reconstructing events
from forensic traces, identifying deception in carefully crafted
alibis)</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> You examine a crime scene. DC 14 deduction
identifies the entry point and sequence of events. DC 16 deduction
analyzes blood spatter and body position to determine the killer was
left-handed and approximately six feet tall. DC 18+ deduction spots the
micro-staging—furniture moved slightly to suggest struggle, but dust
patterns prove it was repositioned <em>after</em> the death.</p>
<p><strong>Streetwise (PRE):</strong> Reading social dynamics, finding
contacts, navigating underground networks, knowing who to ask and how to
ask without drawing unwanted attention. Streetwise is social capital in
places where official authority doesn’t reach—criminal underworlds,
marginalized communities, gray-market economies.</p>
<p><em>Typical DCs:</em> - <strong>DC 14</strong>: Finding reliable
informants in your home territory, basic navigation of local underground
networks - <strong>DC 16</strong>: Gaining trust in unfamiliar
neighborhoods, approaching contacts with valuable or dangerous
information - <strong>DC 18+</strong>: Operating in actively hostile
territory, convincing high-level criminals or paranoid contacts to talk,
navigating factional conflicts</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> You need information about illegal shipments at the
docks. DC 14 streetwise finds a dockworker willing to talk over drinks.
DC 16 streetwise gets you an introduction to a mid-level smuggler who
can confirm routes and schedules. DC 18+ streetwise convinces the
smuggler to reveal his employer’s identity despite the risk to his own
neck.</p>
<p><strong>Worked Example: Kira Investigates</strong></p>
<p>Kira is investigating a murder tied to her missing partner. The
victim was a low-level accountant who worked for a shell corporation.
Here’s how her investigation unfolds using the Urban Investigation
package:</p>
<p><em>Scene 1: Research</em></p>
<p>Kira starts with <strong>Research</strong> (DC 14) to pull police
reports and public records. She rolls <code>4d6+2</code> (RSN +2) = 16.
<strong>Full Success</strong>. She finds the victim was last seen
leaving a dockside warehouse owned by Meridian Imports, a company with
thin financials and a PO box address. The official cause of death was
“accidental fall,” but the coroner’s notes mention “inconsistent
bruising.”</p>
<p><em>Scene 2: Streetwise</em></p>
<p>Kira uses <strong>Streetwise</strong> (DC 16) to find a contact at
the docks who might know about Meridian Imports. She rolls
<code>4d6+1</code> (PRE +1) = 17. <strong>Full Success</strong>. Her
contact, an old dockworker named Sal, tells her about late-night
shipments—unmarked crates, regular crew, and a man in an expensive suit
who shows up every Tuesday. Sal’s seen people get hurt for asking too
many questions.</p>
<p><em>Scene 3: Surveillance</em></p>
<p>Kira stakes out the warehouse with <strong>Surveillance</strong> (DC
16). She rolls <code>4d6+1</code> (AGI +1) = 14. <strong>Partial
Success</strong> (margin -2). She photographs suspects loading crates
and identifies the suited man from Sal’s description, but one of the
crew notices her camera flash. She’s got evidence, but she’s burned her
cover—now they know someone’s watching.</p>
<p><em>Pressure Escalates:</em></p>
<p>The GM ticks a pressure clock: “Meridian Aware.” Kira has valuable
intel (photos, confirmation of illegal activity) but the opposition
knows someone’s investigating. She’ll need to move fast or they’ll cover
their tracks.</p>
<p><strong>When to Use This Package</strong></p>
<p>Urban Investigation excels at information gathering, but <em>every
check carries risk</em>. Successes reveal clues. Partials reveal clues
<em>with exposure</em>—you learn something but tip your hand, burn a
contact, or draw attention. Failures alert the opposition or close leads
entirely.</p>
<p>Use this package when your campaign involves uncovering secrets,
navigating urban power structures, and managing the consequences of
poking into dangerous truths. It’s perfect for noir mysteries,
conspiracy investigations, crime procedurals, or any game where
information is power and knowledge is dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-starting-gear--resources">Step 3: Starting Gear &amp;
Resources</h2>
<p>Your GM will guide starting <strong>gear</strong> and
<strong>resources</strong>. Unlike some RPGs that track every coin and
ounce, this system prioritizes narrative significance over simulationist
detail. You don’t need exhaustive equipment lists—you need tools that
matter to your character’s approach and story.</p>
<p><strong>Core Tools</strong></p>
<p>Most characters begin with equipment relevant to their concept and
skill packages:</p>
<p><strong>Weapons and armor:</strong> If combat is central to your
concept, you’ll have appropriate armaments. A mercenary starts with a
sword and shield or firearm. A duelist has a rapier and light armor. A
brawler might just have brass knuckles and attitude. Your gear should
match your concept and proficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Professional equipment:</strong> Investigators have lockpick
sets, cameras, and notebooks. Scholars have reference books and research
tools. Hackers have laptops and custom software. Alchemists have
portable labs. Your professional tools create narrative permission—you
can attempt tasks because you have the right equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Resources (Narrative Tools)</strong></p>
<p>Resources are intangible assets that give you leverage in the
fiction:</p>
<p><strong>Contacts:</strong> People who owe you favors, provide
information, or offer safe harbor. “I know a fence in the Rivertown
district” or “My old squad mate works port security now.”</p>
<p><strong>Reputation:</strong> How you’re known in relevant circles.
“I’m respected among the Thieves’ Guild” or “Nobles remember I saved the
Duke’s daughter.”</p>
<p><strong>Safe houses and havens:</strong> Places you can retreat to,
hide, or regroup. “I have a bolt-hole in the warehouse district” or “The
monastery will shelter me if I need sanctuary.”</p>
<p><strong>Debts and obligations:</strong> Things owed to you or that
you owe. “The crime lord owes me a favor for past work” or “I owe the
information broker three jobs for the intel he provided.”</p>
<p>Resources aren’t tracked with numbers—they’re fictional positioning
you can leverage during play. When you invoke a contact, the GM decides
what they can do and what it costs. When you use a favor, it gets
expended. Resources create story, not mechanical bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Kira’s Starting Gear</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core tools:</strong> Pocket notebook (for notes and
sketches), concealed camera (for surveillance), lockpick set (for
accessing restricted areas), burner phone (for anonymous contacts)</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Contact in the police department (Detective Rourke, who feeds her
information off the books)</li>
<li>Contact at the docks (Sal, the dockworker from the example
above)</li>
<li>Favor owed by a fixer named Voss (dangerous to invoke, but powerful
when needed)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This gear doesn’t make Kira mechanically stronger, but it shapes
<em>how she approaches problems</em>. She’s not kicking down doors—she’s
gathering evidence, leveraging contacts, and operating in gray areas
where official authority doesn’t reach.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-connections--hooks">Step 4: Connections &amp; Hooks</h2>
<p>The difference between a good character and a great one often comes
down to <strong>connections</strong> and <strong>hooks</strong>—the
relationships and motivations that tie your character to the world and
pull them into the story.</p>
<p><strong>Connections: Who Do You Know?</strong></p>
<p>Define your character’s relationships to other PCs, important NPCs,
and factions:</p>
<p><strong>Other PCs:</strong> How do you know each other? What’s your
history? “We fought together in the war” or “She’s my estranged sister”
or “I hired him for a job that went sideways—we’ve been watching each
other’s backs ever since.”</p>
<p><strong>NPCs:</strong> Who matters to you? Mentors, rivals, lovers,
family, enemies. “My mentor was killed under mysterious circumstances”
or “I have a rivalry with the city’s other top investigator” or “My
brother works for the people I’m investigating.”</p>
<p><strong>Factions:</strong> Where do you stand with organizations and
power structures? “I’m on good terms with the Thieves’ Guild but owe
them a favor” or “The city guard distrusts me after I exposed corruption
in their ranks” or “I’m secretly working for the rebellion while
maintaining cover as a loyal citizen.”</p>
<p>Connections create immediate story opportunities. They’re sources of
information, complications, drama, and support. When you introduce a
connection, you’re handing the GM a tool to create compelling
scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Motivations: What Drives You?</strong></p>
<p>What does your character <em>want</em>? Not just short-term goals,
but deeper drives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenge:</strong> Someone wronged you or someone you loved.
You won’t rest until accounts are settled.</li>
<li><strong>Justice:</strong> You believe in fairness and law (official
or personal). You can’t abide injustice.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery:</strong> You need to know—secrets, truths,
mysteries. Knowledge drives you.</li>
<li><strong>Survival:</strong> You’re staying alive in a dangerous
world. Everything else is secondary.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth:</strong> Money is freedom, security, power. You
pursue it relentlessly.</li>
<li><strong>Redemption:</strong> You’re atoning for past mistakes. You
need to prove you’re better than you were.</li>
<li><strong>Protection:</strong> You’re keeping someone or something
safe, whatever it costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good motivations create conflict and choice. When your motivation
clashes with someone else’s, drama happens. When pursuing your
motivation requires sacrifice, meaningful decisions emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Hooks: Why Are You Here?</strong></p>
<p>Hooks answer the critical question: “Why is your character in this
story, right now?” They tie you to the campaign’s opening situation and
justify your involvement in the plot.</p>
<p><strong>Strong hooks</strong> are immediate and compelling: - “My
partner vanished investigating this case. The new murder has the same
MO.” - “I’m being blackmailed to infiltrate this group. If I don’t
deliver, they ruin my family.” - “I witnessed the inciting event. They
know I saw. I can’t run forever.”</p>
<p><strong>Weak hooks</strong> are passive or generic: - “I’m looking
for adventure” (no urgency, no stakes) - “Someone hired me” (no personal
investment) - “I was passing through” (no reason to stay when things get
dangerous)</p>
<p>Work with your GM to create hooks that immediately pull you into the
story. If the campaign opens with a murder, maybe you knew the victim.
If it’s a heist, maybe you’re in debt to the person organizing it. If
it’s a rebellion, maybe the regime killed your family.</p>
<p>Hooks should make it <em>harder to leave than to stay</em>. When
things get dangerous (and they will), your hook is why you don’t walk
away.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Kira’s Connections and Hooks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> - <strong>Missing partner
(Marcus):</strong> They were investigating the Meridian crime family
together. He vanished six months ago. No body, no leads, just gone. -
<strong>Detective Rourke (police contact):</strong> Old friend who feeds
Kira information off the books. He’s sympathetic but can’t act
officially. - <strong>Voss (fixer):</strong> Dangerous contact who owes
Kira a favor from past work. Calling it in comes with strings. -
<strong>Other PCs:</strong> Maybe one PC is a former informant Kira
protected, creating loyalty. Maybe another PC works for Meridian and
doesn’t know Kira’s investigating them yet—instant tension.</p>
<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> - <strong>Justice:</strong> Kira
believes in finding truth and holding powerful people accountable, even
when official channels fail. - <strong>Loyalty:</strong> Marcus was more
than a partner—family. She won’t stop until she knows what happened to
him.</p>
<p><strong>Hooks:</strong> The campaign opens with a high-profile
murder—a city councilman found dead in suspicious circumstances. The
official investigation is moving toward “suicide,” but Kira recognizes
details that match Marcus’s last case notes. She’s pulled in immediately
because this murder might be the thread that leads to Marcus. She can’t
<em>not</em> investigate, even though it puts her in danger.</p>
<p>Kira’s mechanically competent (high RSN, investigation skills) and
narratively hooked (partner’s disappearance tied directly to the opening
mystery). She’s ready to play—she has tools to contribute, relationships
to leverage, and burning reasons to engage with the story.</p>
<h2 id="worked-example">Worked Example: Building Kira</h2>
<p>Let’s walk through Kira’s creation step-by-step to show how all the
pieces fit together.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Concept &amp; Attributes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> “A street-smart investigator haunted by her
missing partner”</p>
<p>This immediately suggests: - Investigation and information-gathering
focus - Personal stakes (the missing partner) - Noir tone—moral
complexity, urban danger, secrets - Likely modern or urban fantasy
setting</p>
<p><strong>Attributes (using +2, +1, +1, +0 array):</strong> -
<strong>MIG +0:</strong> Not physically imposing. She’s not solving
problems with strength. - <strong>AGI +1:</strong> Quick reflexes, good
for tailing suspects and getting out of tight spots. - <strong>RSN
+2:</strong> Her primary strength—sharp analytical mind, connects clues
others miss. - <strong>PRE +1:</strong> Socially competent, can talk her
way into places and read people effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Skills &amp; Proficiencies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skill Package:</strong> <em>Urban Investigation</em>
(Research, Surveillance, Deduction, Streetwise)</p>
<p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> - <strong>Contacts Network:</strong>
Extensive web of informants across the city. Advantage when finding
information through people rather than records. - <strong>Fast
Talker:</strong> Advantage on social checks when bluffing, misdirecting,
or talking your way out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Starting Gear &amp; Resources</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gear:</strong> - Pocket notebook and pen (for case notes) -
Concealed camera (for surveillance) - Lockpick set (for accessing
restricted areas) - Burner phone (for anonymous contacts)</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> - Detective Rourke (police contact, feeds
information off the books) - Sal (dockworker contact in the warehouse
district) - Favor owed by Voss (fixer with dangerous connections)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Connections &amp; Hooks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> - Marcus (missing partner, personal and
professional bond) - Detective Rourke (ally within the system) - Voss
(dangerous obligation/resource) - Meridian crime family
(antagonists—she’s investigating them)</p>
<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> - Justice (won’t let powerful people
escape accountability) - Loyalty (won’t abandon Marcus, even though he’s
missing)</p>
<p><strong>Hooks:</strong> Campaign opens with councilman’s murder. Case
details match Marcus’s last investigation. Kira recognizes the pattern
immediately—she’s investigating whether these deaths are connected and
whether Marcus’s disappearance is linked to this conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>The Complete Picture</strong></p>
<p>Kira is a character built for a modern noir mystery campaign. She’s
mechanically focused on investigation and social navigation (high RSN,
Urban Investigation package, social proficiencies). She’s narratively
driven by personal loss and justice (Marcus’s disappearance, commitment
to holding powerful people accountable). She has immediate story
engagement (the opening murder connects directly to her partner’s
case).</p>
<p>She’s ready to play from session one: competent enough to contribute
meaningfully, motivated enough to drive action, and hooked into the
central mystery so deeply she can’t walk away.</p>

<h1 id="ph-character-progression">Character Progression</h1>
<h2 id="progression-overview">Progression Overview</h2>
<p>Character progression means two things: <strong>mechanical
growth</strong> (new skills, proficiencies, attribute improvements) and
<strong>narrative evolution</strong> (character arcs, changing
motivations, deepening relationships).</p>
<p>Both matter. Mechanics give you new tools. Narrative gives you
context for why you’ve changed and where you’re headed.</p>
<h2 id="advancement-mechanics">Advancement Mechanics</h2>
<p>Your character grows through <strong>advancement
opportunities</strong> tied to play. Common triggers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completing arcs:</strong> Resolve a personal story beat,
achieve a major goal, or overcome a defining challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Milestones:</strong> Reach narrative checkpoints set by the
GM (end of an adventure, major turning point).</li>
<li><strong>Session-based:</strong> Advance after a set number of
sessions (every 3–4 sessions).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you advance, you typically gain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New skill:</strong> Add a skill from an adjacent package or
expand your expertise.</li>
<li><strong>New proficiency:</strong> Gain narrative permission and
mechanical edge in a new area.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute improvement:</strong> Rare; tied to major
milestones or transformative arcs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work with your GM to choose advancements that fit your character’s
story.</p>
<h2 id="narrative-arcs">Narrative Arcs</h2>
<p>Progression shines when <strong>mechanical growth reflects narrative
change</strong>.</p>
<p>If your character learns to distrust authority after betrayal, gain a
proficiency like <em>Skeptical Investigator</em>. If they train with a
master duelist, gain <em>Blades</em> or improve MIG/AGI. If they uncover
arcane secrets, expand into <em>Arcane Lore</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Character arcs</strong> give progression meaning. Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What has my character learned?</li>
<li>How have they changed?</li>
<li>What new goals or conflicts have emerged?</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanical advancements should answer these questions.</p>
<h2 id="milestone-vs-session-based">Milestone vs. Session-Based</h2>
<p>Tables use different progression models:</p>
<p><strong>Milestone-Based:</strong> Advance at story checkpoints (end
of an arc, major victory, transformative event). Ties progression
tightly to fiction. Pacing varies by campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Session-Based:</strong> Advance every X sessions (typically
3–4). Predictable, ensures regular growth regardless of narrative
pacing.</p>
<p>Your GM chooses the model that fits your campaign. Both work well.
Milestones emphasize story. Session-based ensures steady growth.</p>
<h2 id="worked-example">Worked Example</h2>
<p><strong>Character:</strong> Kira, the street-smart investigator (from
Chapter 05)</p>
<p><strong>Arc Completed:</strong> After six sessions, Kira exposed the
crime family responsible for her partner’s disappearance. She didn’t get
revenge—her partner was already dead—but she brought the killers to
justice and learned to trust her new crew.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative Change:</strong> Kira entered the campaign
distrustful and isolated. She now values her allies and has begun
letting go of guilt over her partner’s death.</p>
<p><strong>Advancement Choice:</strong> Kira gains the <em>Tactical
Coordination</em> proficiency, reflecting her growth as a team player.
She also adds <em>Street Combat</em> to her skill set after multiple
dangerous confrontations. Both choices tie directly to her arc: she’s
learned to fight alongside others and trust them in tight spots.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Mechanically, Kira is more effective in
group combat. Narratively, her character has evolved from lone wolf to
team player. Both dimensions reinforce each other.</p>
<h2 id="optimization-and-build-paths">Optimization and Build Paths</h2>
<p>For players who enjoy theorycrafting and maximizing effectiveness,
this section provides frameworks for building synergistic character
capabilities. You don’t need to optimize—competent characters emerge
from following your narrative instincts. But if you enjoy the puzzle of
capability stacking, these patterns help.</p>
<h3 id="specialization-vs-generalization">Specialization
vs. Generalization</h3>
<p><strong>Specialists</strong> excel dramatically in one area but have
gaps elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Mastery grants reliability. High skill
bonuses mean consistent success on checks in your specialty.
Proficiencies compound your edge. You become the go-to expert for
specific challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Dependency on party support for
gaps. Limited versatility when your specialty isn’t relevant. Risk of
redundancy if another PC shares your focus.</li>
<li><strong>Best for</strong>: Group play with complementary
specialists. Solo play requires generalization—avoid narrow
specialization if you’re the only PC.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Generalists</strong> handle diverse challenges adequately but
rarely excel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Flexibility. You contribute
meaningfully across combat, social, and exploration challenges. No dead
weight—always have relevant skills.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Never the best at anything.
Specialists outperform you in their domain. Mediocrity in
optimization-heavy tables.</li>
<li><strong>Best for</strong>: Solo play, small groups (2-3 PCs), or
tables that value versatility over mastery.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hybrid Approach</strong> (recommended): Specialize in 2-3
areas, maintain competence in others. Example: Combat primary, social
secondary, basic exploration capability. You dominate your focus while
contributing elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="skill-synergies">Skill Synergies</h3>
<p>Certain skill combinations create compound advantages:</p>
<p><strong>Investigation + Social</strong> (Detective/Interrogator): -
<strong>Research</strong> (find clues) + <strong>Insight</strong> (read
suspects) + <strong>Persuasion</strong> (extract confessions) -
<strong>Why it works</strong>: Information gathering flows naturally
from evidence to people. Each skill advances your investigative goals. -
<strong>Proficiency pairing</strong>: <em>Keen Observer</em> (notice
details) + <em>Silver Tongue</em> (manipulate conversations)</p>
<p><strong>Combat + Athletics</strong> (Mobile Warrior): -
<strong>Melee/Ranged Combat</strong> + <strong>Athletics</strong>
(climb, jump, maneuver) - <strong>Why it works</strong>: Positioning is
combat advantage. Athletics lets you claim high ground, leap obstacles,
or pursue fleeing enemies. - <strong>Proficiency pairing</strong>:
<em>Acrobatic Fighter</em> (move and attack) + <em>Parkour</em>
(navigate terrain freely)</p>
<p><strong>Stealth + Technical</strong> (Infiltrator): -
<strong>Stealth</strong> (move unseen) + <strong>Security</strong>
(bypass locks) + <strong>Subterfuge</strong> (disguise, forgery) -
<strong>Why it works</strong>: Infiltration requires layered
capabilities. One skill gets you in, others sustain the deception and
handle obstacles. - <strong>Proficiency pairing</strong>: <em>Shadow
Walker</em> (blend with environment) + <em>Lock Specialist</em> (open
anything)</p>
<p><strong>Social + Deception</strong> (Manipulator): -
<strong>Persuasion</strong> (convince) + <strong>Deception</strong> (lie
convincingly) + <strong>Insight</strong> (read motives) - <strong>Why it
works</strong>: Social manipulation requires reading people, crafting
believable stories, and selling them. Each skill supports the others. -
<strong>Proficiency pairing</strong>: <em>Con Artist</em> (elaborate
deceptions) + <em>Poker Face</em> (unreadable intentions)</p>
<p><strong>Technical + Lore</strong> (Problem Solver): -
<strong>Technical skills</strong> (Engineering, Medicine, etc.) +
<strong>Relevant Lore</strong> (understand context) - <strong>Why it
works</strong>: Technical competence without context is guesswork. Lore
lets you anticipate problems and apply technical skills meaningfully. -
<strong>Proficiency pairing</strong>: <em>Engineer</em> (build/repair) +
<em>Scholar</em> (deep knowledge)</p>
<h3 id="build-archetypes">Build Archetypes</h3>
<p>These templates provide optimization paths. You don’t need to follow
them rigidly—use them as inspiration for synergistic capability
sets.</p>
<h4 id="tactician-combat-specialist">Tactician (Combat Specialist)</h4>
<p><strong>Core Concept</strong>: Dominate tactical situations through
positioning, terrain use, and action economy mastery.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Skills</strong>: Melee or Ranged Combat, Athletics,
Tactics <strong>Secondary Skills</strong>: Perception (battlefield
awareness), Intimidation (control opponents) <strong>Key
Proficiencies</strong>: <em>Combat Veteran</em> (bonus in fights),
<em>Tactical Mind</em> (advantage on setup actions), <em>Mobile
Combatant</em> (move and strike)</p>
<p><strong>Advancement Path</strong>: 1. <strong>Early</strong>
(Sessions 1-6): Establish combat dominance. Take Combat skill and
<em>Combat Veteran</em> proficiency. 2. <strong>Mid</strong> (Sessions
7-12): Add Athletics for positioning. Take <em>Mobile Combatant</em> to
combine movement with attacks. 3. <strong>Late</strong> (Sessions 13+):
Add Tactics for team coordination. Take <em>Tactical Mind</em> to grant
allies advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization Notes</strong>: Stack advantage sources—flanking
+ elevation + setup actions = consistent success. Focus on creating
opportunities for allies, not just personal damage output. Learn enemy
weaknesses through Tactics checks before engaging.</p>
<h4 id="social-manipulator-social-specialist">Social Manipulator (Social
Specialist)</h4>
<p><strong>Core Concept</strong>: Control social situations through
persuasion, deception, and information gathering.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Skills</strong>: Persuasion, Deception, Insight
<strong>Secondary Skills</strong>: Relevant Lore (context for
manipulation), Streetwise (navigate social networks) <strong>Key
Proficiencies</strong>: <em>Silver Tongue</em> (bonus on social checks),
<em>Poker Face</em> (hide intentions), <em>Network</em> (contacts
everywhere)</p>
<p><strong>Advancement Path</strong>: 1. <strong>Early</strong>
(Sessions 1-6): Establish social dominance. Take Persuasion and
<em>Silver Tongue</em>. 2. <strong>Mid</strong> (Sessions 7-12): Add
Deception for flexibility. Take <em>Poker Face</em> to prevent Insight
checks against you. 3. <strong>Late</strong> (Sessions 13+): Add Insight
to read opponents. Take <em>Network</em> for access to information and
resources.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization Notes</strong>: Multi-round social contests
favor you—each round builds advantage. Leverage NPC traits
(<em>Greedy</em>, <em>Honorable</em>) by framing offers to align with
their values. Use Insight before negotiating to identify leverage
points.</p>
<h4 id="technical-specialist-problem-solver">Technical Specialist
(Problem Solver)</h4>
<p><strong>Core Concept</strong>: Handle technical challenges, crafting,
and specialized knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Skills</strong>: Engineering, Medicine, or Science
(choose 2-3 technical domains) <strong>Secondary Skills</strong>:
Relevant Lore, Perception (notice technical details) <strong>Key
Proficiencies</strong>: <em>Engineer</em> (build/repair), <em>Field
Medic</em> (stabilize injuries), <em>Inventor</em> (create
solutions)</p>
<p><strong>Advancement Path</strong>: 1. <strong>Early</strong>
(Sessions 1-6): Establish technical mastery. Take 2 technical skills and
<em>Engineer</em>. 2. <strong>Mid</strong> (Sessions 7-12): Add Lore for
context. Take <em>Inventor</em> to create custom solutions. 3.
<strong>Late</strong> (Sessions 13+): Add third technical domain or
broaden to investigation skills. Take <em>Master Craftsman</em> for
exceptional quality.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization Notes</strong>: Technical specialists shine in
preparation. Use downtime to craft gear, research problems, or prototype
solutions. Pre-game planning lets you bring the right tool for
anticipated challenges.</p>
<h3 id="avoiding-common-pitfalls">Avoiding Common Pitfalls</h3>
<p><strong>Over-Specialization</strong>: Taking only combat skills
leaves you useless in social or exploration scenes. Aim for at least 2
capability domains (e.g., combat + social, or investigation +
technical).</p>
<p><strong>Redundancy</strong>: If another PC is the party’s face,
adding Persuasion as your primary creates overlap without adding value.
Choose complementary capabilities instead.</p>
<p><strong>Neglecting Narrative</strong>: Optimization without character
integration feels hollow. Why does your character have these skills? How
do they reflect who they are? Mechanics should support story, not
replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Chasing Perfection</strong>: “Optimal” builds assume perfect
information and controlled conditions. Real play is messy. Competent,
flexible characters outperform hyper-specialized optimizations when
plans go sideways.</p>

<h1 id="ph-actions-checks">Actions &amp; Checks</h1>
<h2 id="when-to-roll">When to Roll</h2>
<p>You roll when the GM calls for a check—when your action has uncertain
outcomes and meaningful stakes. If you’re competent with time and
safety, the GM might call it auto-success. If failure would stall play,
the GM might offer success with cost (Partial) or reframe failure to
keep momentum.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: “Could this go multiple ways?” and “Does it matter
now?” If yes to both, expect a roll. If no, the GM narrates forward.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-roll-at-a-glance">When to Roll (and When Not To)
At-a-Glance</h3>
<p>The <strong>GM</strong> (Game Master—the person who facilitates the
game and describes the world) calls for rolls when three criteria
align:</p>
<p><strong>1. Uncertain Outcome</strong>: Success isn’t guaranteed. A
trained locksmith opening a simple door doesn’t roll. A thief picking a
complex lock under pressure does.</p>
<p><strong>2. Consequential Stakes</strong>: Failure introduces
complications, costs, or escalation. If failure just means “try again,”
don’t roll—either it succeeds with time or it’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>3. Player Agency</strong>: The character can meaningfully
influence the result. Don’t roll for things completely outside control
(like whether a distant NPC makes a decision).</p>
<p><strong>Examples of When TO Roll:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sneaking past alert guards (uncertain, you could be spotted;
consequential, detection changes everything; agency, your approach
matters)</li>
<li>Convincing a skeptical merchant to extend credit (uncertain, she’s
cautious; consequential, failure means finding another source; agency,
your persuasion matters)</li>
<li>Climbing a crumbling wall during a storm (uncertain, conditions are
poor; consequential, falling causes injury and delays; agency, your
technique matters)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of When NOT to Roll:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An expert chef making simple bread (certain for their skill level,
no stakes)</li>
<li>Searching a room when you have unlimited time and no threats
(inevitable success, no pressure)</li>
<li>Whether a random <strong>NPC</strong> (Non-Player
Character—controlled by the GM) arrives at a location (no player
agency)</li>
</ul>
<p>When all three criteria are met, roll a <strong>check</strong>:
<code>4d6</code> (four six-sided dice) + modifiers vs
<strong>DC</strong> (Difficulty Class—target number to meet or exceed).
Otherwise, the GM narrates forward without dice.</p>
<p><strong>For complete when-to-roll guidance</strong>: See <a
href="../../mechanics_reference/chapters/03-check-resolution.md#check-resolution">Mechanics
Reference, Chapter 3 (Check Resolution)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="declaring-actions">Declaring Actions</h2>
<p>When you declare an action, state two things:</p>
<p><strong>Intent:</strong> What you’re trying to accomplish. “I climb
the wall” or “I convince the captain to let us pass.”</p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong> How you’re doing it. “Using handholds,
moving quietly” or “Appealing to her duty, offering coin.”</p>
<p>The GM uses intent and approach to pick the DC, determine which skill
or proficiency applies, and decide on Advantage or Disadvantage. Be
specific—your approach shapes fiction and mechanics. If the GM asks for
clarification, they’re helping you find the best angle or exposing
risks.</p>
<h2 id="advantage--disadvantage">Advantage &amp; Disadvantage</h2>
<p>The fiction grants mechanical shifts through
<strong>advantage</strong> and <strong>disadvantage</strong>. Instead of
adjusting the DC, the game modifies your dice pool to represent
favorable or unfavorable circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage</strong> means you roll extra dice and keep the
best 4: - <strong>+1 Advantage</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep the best 4 dice
- <strong>+2 Advantage</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep the best 4 dice</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong> means you roll extra dice and keep the
worst 4: - <strong>-1 Disadvantage</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep the worst 4
dice - <strong>-2 Disadvantage</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep the worst 4
dice</p>
<p><strong>You gain Advantage when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have superior positioning (high ground, cover, surprise,
flanking)</li>
<li>You’re using expert tools or specialized gear</li>
<li>An ally is actively helping you (and the GM agrees their help is
meaningful)</li>
<li>The environment favors your approach (quiet space for stealth, good
lighting for searching, stable footing for athletics)</li>
<li>You took a setup action first (scouted ahead, cleared obstacles,
coordinated with allies)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You have Disadvantage when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positioning works against you (cramped space, unstable footing,
exposed position)</li>
<li>You lack proper tools or are improvising with unsuitable
equipment</li>
<li>You’re rushed, distracted, or under significant pressure</li>
<li>The environment hinders you (dim light for precise work, loud noise
for stealth, rough terrain for movement)</li>
<li>You have a relevant condition (<em>Exhausted</em>, <em>Dazed</em>,
<em>Bleeding</em>, <em>Frightened</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Advantage and disadvantage come in levels
(±1 or ±2), but they cap at those levels. Multiple sources of +1
advantage don’t stack to become +2—you need a particularly strong source
for +2. If you have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel out—net
them (e.g., +1 advantage and -1 disadvantage = roll normally with 4d6;
+2 advantage and -1 disadvantage = +1 advantage, roll 5d6 keep best
4).</p>
<p>You can create Advantage by taking a setup action first: scouting
ahead, clearing obstacles, or coordinating with allies. This is often
tactically smart—spend one turn creating advantage for a critical
roll.</p>
<h3 id="advantage-disadvantage-quick-reference">Advantage &amp;
Disadvantage Quick Reference</h3>
<p><strong>Core Rule: They Net Out at ±2 Levels</strong></p>
<p>Advantage and disadvantage come in two levels each: - <strong>+1
Advantage</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep best 4 - <strong>+2
Advantage</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep best 4 - <strong>-1
Disadvantage</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep worst 4 - <strong>-2
Disadvantage</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep worst 4</p>
<p>Multiple sources of the same type don’t stack beyond these levels.
You either have +1 advantage, +2 advantage, normal, -1 disadvantage, or
-2 disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>Competing Sources Cancel Out</strong></p>
<p>When you have both advantage and disadvantage from different sources,
they cancel partially or completely: - <strong>+1 Advantage + -1
Disadvantage</strong> = Roll normally (4d6) - <strong>+2 Advantage + -1
Disadvantage</strong> = +1 Advantage (5d6, keep best 4) - <strong>+1
Advantage + -2 Disadvantage</strong> = -1 Disadvantage (5d6, keep worst
4) - <strong>+2 Advantage + -2 Disadvantage</strong> = Roll normally
(4d6)</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>You’re shooting at an enemy from high ground (<em>Elevated</em> tag
grants +1 Advantage) but visibility is poor (<em>Dim Light</em> tag
imposes -1 Disadvantage). The two effects cancel completely—you roll 4d6
normally.</p>
<p><strong>Common Sources of Advantage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superior positioning</strong>: High ground, cover for ranged
attacks, flanking in melee</li>
<li><strong>Specialized tools or gear</strong>: Masterwork lockpicks,
precision instruments, quality climbing equipment</li>
<li><strong>Ally actively helping</strong>: Someone distracts the guard
while you sneak, holds the rope while you climb</li>
<li><strong>Environmental favor</strong>: Good lighting for detailed
work, stable footing for athletics, quiet space for stealth</li>
<li><strong>Setup actions</strong>: You scouted the route first, you
cleared obstacles beforehand, you coordinated signals with allies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Sources of Disadvantage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor positioning</strong>: Cramped quarters, unstable
footing, no cover while exposed</li>
<li><strong>Improvised tools</strong>: Using a dagger as a pry bar, rope
instead of proper climbing gear</li>
<li><strong>Time pressure or distraction</strong>: Guards approaching,
building collapsing, ally calling for help</li>
<li><strong>Environmental hindrance</strong>: Dim light for ranged
attacks, rough terrain for movement, loud noise for stealth</li>
<li><strong>Conditions</strong>: <em>Exhausted</em> (physical actions),
<em>Dazed</em> (perception and reactions), <em>Frightened</em> (actions
while threat visible), <em>Bleeding</em> (strenuous activity)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edge Case: Multiple Sources of Same Type</strong></p>
<p>Even if you have three sources of +1 advantage (high ground, expert
tools, and an ally helping), you still only get +1 advantage—roll 5d6,
keep best 4. Advantage doesn’t compound beyond ±2 levels.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Design Philosophy: Why Advantage Caps at ±2</strong></p>
<p>Advantage and disadvantage are capped at ±2 levels for a crucial
design reason: <strong>bounded accuracy</strong>. The system is built on
a predictable range of outcomes (rolling 4d6, average ~14, range 4-24).
If advantage stacked without limit, characters could engineer guaranteed
success by layering multiple benefits, breaking the tension that makes
rolls meaningful.</p>
<p>Capping at ±2 preserves meaningful risk. Even with every advantage
(+2 advantage = 6d6 keep best 4, average ~17), you can still roll badly.
Even with significant disadvantage (-2 disadvantage = 6d6 keep worst 4,
average ~11), you can still succeed through luck or player
resourcefulness. The dice still matter.</p>
<p>This cap also prevents “advantage farming”—the temptation to delay
action while stacking every possible benefit. The game rewards smart
positioning and preparation (setup actions grant advantage), but doesn’t
let you optimize away all risk. Competence improves your odds; it
doesn’t eliminate failure.</p>
<p>In tactical terms: <strong>Get advantage when you can, but don’t
chase perfection</strong>. +1 advantage (~+1.5 to average roll) is
meaningful. +2 advantage (~+3 to average roll) is strong. But you’ll
never reach a point where rolls become trivial. The fiction remains
dynamic, and outcomes stay uncertain.</p>
<hr />
<p>To get +2 advantage, you typically need an exceptionally favorable
situation or a particularly powerful source (magic, special abilities,
or the GM judging the circumstances are overwhelmingly in your
favor).</p>
<p><strong>Common Misconception</strong>: “If I have two advantages and
one disadvantage, do I still get advantage?”</p>
<p>It depends on the levels. If you have +1 advantage from two sources
(which doesn’t stack, so it’s just +1) and -1 disadvantage from one
source, they cancel out—you roll normally (4d6).</p>
<p>If you have +2 advantage from an exceptional circumstance and -1
disadvantage from a condition, you net to +1 advantage (roll 5d6, keep
best 4).</p>
<p>Always net out advantage and disadvantage levels before rolling.</p>

<h2 id="reading-results">Reading Results</h2>
<p>Compare your total (4d6 + modifiers) to the DC. Calculate your margin
(Roll - DC). The margin determines your outcome tier and tells you what
changed.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success (Margin ≥+5):</strong> You achieve your
intent spectacularly with extra benefit—extra information, improved
position, a cleared obstacle, or narrative advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Full Success (Margin ≥0):</strong> You achieve your intent
cleanly. The situation shifts in your favor—progress ticks, obstacles
clear, or you gain position.</p>
<p><strong>Partial Success (Margin -1 to -2):</strong> You achieve your
intent with a complication. The GM pre-stated this: a cost, trade-off,
or wrinkle. You moved forward, but so did pressure or danger.</p>
<p><strong>Failure (Margin ≤-3):</strong> You don’t achieve your intent.
The situation escalates or reveals a problem. The GM describes what
changed—guards heard you, the ledge crumbles, the NPC shuts down.
Failure changes what happens next.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure (Margin ≤-7 or all 1s):</strong> A disaster
occurs—the worst possible result with major complications. Things break,
attention is drawn, or dangerous consequences land immediately.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: “What’s different now?” Results always shift the
fiction.</p>
<h2 id="group-actions">Group Actions</h2>
<p>When the party works together, the GM picks one:</p>
<p><strong>Group Check (Majority):</strong> Everyone rolls. If most
succeed, the group succeeds. If split, treat as Partial. Use when each
contributes independently (sneaking, searching).</p>
<p><strong>Group Check (All‑Must‑Succeed):</strong> Everyone rolls; a
single failure breaks the attempt. Use when chained together (fragile
bridge, coordinated ritual).</p>
<p><strong>Helping:</strong> If not rolling but assisting, describe how.
The GM might grant Advantage to the lead character.</p>
<p><strong>Contests:</strong> Both sides roll. Higher total wins. The GM
pre-states outcomes for each side (chase, debate, arm-wrestling).</p>
<h3 id="group-checks-quick-reference">Group Checks Quick Reference</h3>
<p>When multiple <strong>PCs</strong> (Player Characters—the characters
you control) collaborate on a shared goal, use group checks to
streamline resolution and share risk.</p>
<p><strong>How Group Checks Work:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Identify the leader</strong>—the character most qualified or
driving the effort.</li>
<li><strong>The leader rolls</strong> the check against the DC (4d6 +
modifiers).</li>
<li><strong>Assistants provide Advantage</strong> by contributing
meaningfully. Each assistant describes how they help. If their
contribution makes sense, the GM grants advantage levels (usually +1,
sometimes +2 if the help is exceptional).</li>
<li><strong>Everyone shares the consequences</strong>. If the check
results in a Partial or Failure, assistants take on costs too.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example: Climbing a Cliff</strong></p>
<p>Your party climbs a steep cliff to reach a fortress. The GM sets DC
16 (Tough—rocky, unstable handholds). The character with highest MIG or
AGI leads. Another character with rope and climbing experience describes
securing anchors and guiding the route—the GM grants +1 Advantage. The
leader rolls 5d6 (keep best 4) + modifiers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical Success (21+, margin ≥+5):</strong> Everyone
reaches the top safely, and you find a hidden ledge that provides a
perfect vantage point for scouting the fortress.</li>
<li><strong>Full Success (16-20, margin ≥0):</strong> Everyone reaches
the top safely. No complications.</li>
<li><strong>Partial Success (14-15, margin -1 to -2):</strong> Everyone
makes it, but the rope frays badly. It’ll break if used again without
repair.</li>
<li><strong>Failure (11-13, margin ≤-3):</strong> The leader slips.
Everyone stops to stabilize them, losing time. Pressure clock ticks
(guards patrol closer).</li>
<li><strong>Critical Failure (≤10 or all 1s):</strong> The leader falls,
dragging others down. Everyone takes damage and makes noise—guards are
alerted immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only those who can meaningfully contribute should assist. Don’t let
the whole party help with a Hacking check if only one character has the
skill.</li>
<li>Assistants share the risk. If the check fails or goes Partial,
everyone faces consequences (not just the leader).</li>
<li>The leader’s skill determines the roll, but assistance grants
advantage levels (not multiple rolls).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to Use Group Checks:</strong></p>
<p>Use them for collaborative efforts where everyone contributes:
climbing, sneaking, searching, coordinating a distraction, or executing
a plan together. Don’t use them when characters have truly independent
goals—those require separate rolls.</p>

<p><strong>You:</strong> “I want to climb the outer wall to reach the
second-floor window.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “How are you doing it?”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I’m using the stonework gaps as handholds and
moving slowly to stay quiet.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 16—it’s steep and the stone is old. Partial
means you make it but dislodge rubble and alert the guards inside. Roll
AGI.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 4d6</strong>: 3, 5, 4, 6 = 18. Add your +3 AGI bonus
= 21 total. <strong>Margin: +5 (Critical Success).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You scale the wall smoothly, finding solid
grips with practiced ease. You reach the window ledge without a sound,
and as you peer inside, you spot a guard’s patrol schedule pinned to the

we’re investigating threats to the city and need access now.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “She’s skeptical but not hostile. DC 14. Partial

<p><strong>You roll and succeed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You notice it’s a three-pin tumbler, and the

have +1 advantage.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “Great. Now I’m picking the lock, using what I
learned.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 16 to pick it quietly. Roll 5d6, keep the

giving you perfect feedback. You ease the door open—no sound, no alert.
You’re in.”</p>
<p>The setup action created advantage, which significantly improved your
chances and turned what could have been risky into a smooth success.</p>

<h1 id="ph-combat-basics">Combat Basics</h1>
<h2 id="combat-overview">Combat Overview</h2>
<p>Combat starts when violence erupts and everyone’s choices matter
moment to moment. The GM calls for initiative when the fiction demands
it—usually when surprise breaks, threats emerge, or negotiation fails.
Combat uses the same core mechanics you know (DCs, outcome tiers, tags,
clocks), but with tighter focus on positioning, immediate danger, and
tactical choices.</p>
<h3 id="resolve-and-clocks">No Hit Points: Resolve and Clocks</h3>
<p>This system doesn’t track hit points. Instead, the GM uses
<strong>resolve clocks</strong> and <strong>conditions</strong> to
represent how much punishment characters and enemies can take before
they’re taken out of the fight.</p>
<p><strong>Resolve Clocks</strong> are segmented progress trackers
(typically 4-6 segments for enemies, more for major threats). When you
land a successful Strike or create pressure, the GM ticks segments on
the enemy’s resolve clock. When the clock fills completely, they’re
out—unconscious, fleeing, surrendering, or dead, depending on the
fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Why Clocks Instead of HP?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiction-First</strong>: Characters are “taken out” when it
makes narrative sense, not at an arbitrary number. A skilled duelist
might fold after 4 solid hits, while a raging beast takes 8.</li>
<li><strong>Visible Progress</strong>: You see the clock filling and
know you’re wearing them down. No hidden HP pools—the GM describes their
state (“staggering,” “defensive,” “desperate”) as segments fill.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Stakes</strong>: The GM can adjust clock size on
the fly based on pacing. Minor enemies get smaller clocks (2-3
segments), major bosses get larger ones (6-8 segments).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You Do</strong>: Focus on the fiction. Describe your
attacks and tactics. The GM handles the clock math behind the screen.
When you land hits or create pressure, you’ll see progress. When the
clock fills, they’re done.</p>
<p><strong>Your Resolve</strong>: The GM tracks your resolve similarly.
Taking damage, failing checks, or suffering consequences ticks your
resolve. When your clock fills, you’re taken out—you might be
unconscious, captured, or forced to retreat. The GM will warn you when
you’re in danger (“You’re hurt bad—two more solid hits and you’re out”).
Use Defend/Withdraw to reset position and buy time to recover.</p>
<h2 id="order--your-turn">Order &amp; Your Turn</h2>
<p>The GM picks an ordering mode based on the scene:</p>
<p><strong>Conversational:</strong> The GM asks “Who acts?” and rotates
spotlight. Natural for small skirmishes or when surprise isn’t a
factor.</p>
<p><strong>Popcorn:</strong> You act, then name who goes next (alternate
sides). Prevents one side from dominating. The GM might say: “You’re up,
then pick who acts next.”</p>
<p>On your turn, you describe your action (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up,
Defend/Withdraw), the GM sets the DC and pre-states outcomes, you roll,
and the GM narrates the result. Then the next person acts.</p>
<h2 id="core-actions">Core Actions</h2>
<p><strong>Strike:</strong> Attack an opponent. Roll contest or passive
DC. On Full, deal damage or apply pressure. On Partial, connect but take
a cost (exposed, pressure ticks). On Fail, they counter or you lose
position.</p>
<p><em>Tactical Notes:</em> Strike is your most direct option but not
always optimal. Against tough enemies (high DC), consider Set Up first
to create Advantage, then Strike with better odds. Against multiple
weaker foes, Strike to eliminate threats fast. Partial Success on Strike
often means trading blows—viable if you’re tougher than they are, risky
if you’re already wounded.</p>
<p><strong>Maneuver:</strong> Shove, trip, disarm, reposition. On Full,
achieve your goal (they’re prone, disarmed, moved). On Partial, trade
something (you go prone too, lose grip). Use to create openings or
control space.</p>
<p><em>Tactical Notes:</em> Maneuver shines when positioning matters
more than damage. Shove an enemy off high ground (removing their
Advantage). Trip a charging brute (apply <em>Prone</em>, making them
vulnerable). Disarm a gunman in close quarters (forcing them to draw a
backup weapon or flee). Maneuver changes the battlefield—use it when the
situation needs changing, not when you just need to hurt someone.</p>
<p><strong>Set Up:</strong> Create advantage for yourself or
allies—cover fire, feint, flank. On Full, grant Advantage or apply a
helpful tag. On Partial, create advantage but expose yourself or tick
pressure.</p>
<p><em>Tactical Notes:</em> Set Up is the team player’s action. Flanking
an enemy grants Advantage to everyone attacking them. Suppressing fire
pins down a sniper while allies advance. Feinting draws attention,
letting your Rogue slip behind for a backstab. Set Up sacrifices your
immediate impact for greater team efficiency. Best used when: (1) your
Strike would be low odds, (2) an ally can capitalize better than you, or
(3) you need to control enemy actions without committing to combat.</p>
<p><strong>Defend/Withdraw:</strong> Change position to safety, clear a
condition, or break contact. On Full, reposition cleanly and clear a
minor tag (Suppressed, Exposed). On Partial, move but give up your next
action. Use when you need breathing room.</p>
<p><em>Tactical Notes:</em> Defend/Withdraw is not cowardice—it’s smart
positioning. Retreat to cover when you’re Exposed. Fall back to force
enemies through a chokepoint. Clear <em>Suppressed</em> so you can act
freely next round.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Design Philosophy: Why Action Economy Matters</strong></p>
<p>Combat limits you to <strong>one action per turn</strong> for a
crucial design reason: <strong>meaningful choices under
pressure</strong>. If you could Strike AND Maneuver AND Set Up every
turn, combat would become a rote optimization puzzle—“do all the best
things in sequence.” Limiting actions forces you to prioritize: <em>What
matters most right now?</em></p>
<p>This creates <strong>tactical tension</strong>. Do you Strike the
wounded enemy to finish them, or Set Up to help your ally against the
bigger threat? Do you Maneuver to high ground for long-term advantage,
or Strike while you have the opening? Every choice means sacrificing
alternatives.</p>
<p>Action economy also balances numerical advantage. Three enemies don’t
just have more total capabilities—they get <strong>three actions per
round</strong> to your one. This makes outnumbering dangerous and forces
players to use terrain, positioning, and coordination to offset
numerical disadvantage. It’s not “you’re outnumbered so you lose”—it’s
“you’re outnumbered, so you need to be smarter.”</p>
<p>From a pacing perspective, limiting actions keeps combat dynamic.
Fights resolve in 3-6 rounds typically, not 10+ slugfests. Each round
matters because you can only do one thing. There’s no downtime between
significant choices—every turn is a decision point.</p>
<p><strong>In tactical terms</strong>: Action economy favors
<strong>efficiency</strong>. Eliminate threats fast (Strike). Create
lasting advantages (Maneuver/Set Up). Don’t waste turns on low-impact
actions when the clock is ticking. Your action is your most valuable
resource each round—spend it wisely.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you’re outnumbered or wounded, resetting position is more valuable
than one more desperate Strike. Know when to disengage and live to fight
another round.</p>
<h2 id="using-terrain--tags">Using Terrain &amp; Tags</h2>
<p>Environmental tags shape your options:</p>
<p><strong>Cover (Fragile vs Solid):</strong> Fragile (crates, thin
walls) grants Advantage but degrades on Partial. Solid (stone, thick
barriers) is reliable. Use Set Up to create or improve cover.</p>
<p><strong>Elevation:</strong> High ground grants Advantage on ranged
attacks and forces opponents to climb to reach you.</p>
<p><strong>Dim/Obscuring Light:</strong> Hinders vision. Grants
Disadvantage to ranged attacks but Advantage to stealth. Use to slip
away or reposition.</p>
<p><strong>Cramped/Slick Terrain:</strong> Cramped spaces make movement
risky. Slick surfaces impose Disadvantage on maneuvers. The GM names
tags; you decide how to use or avoid them.</p>
<h3 id="common-combat-tags">Common Combat Tags At-a-Glance</h3>
<p>These tags appear frequently in combat. Understanding their effects
helps you make quick tactical decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Cover Tags:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fragile Cover</strong> (wooden crates, thin walls): Grants
+1 Advantage on defense checks. Degrades on Partial Success (becomes no
cover). Can be destroyed by focused attacks or environmental
effects.</li>
<li><strong>Solid Cover</strong> (stone walls, thick barriers): Grants
+1 Advantage on defense checks. Does not degrade. Can only be removed by
extreme force or repositioning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning Tags:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elevated</strong> (high ground, rooftop, platform): Grants
+1 Advantage on ranged attacks against lower targets. Forces opponents
to climb (DC 14 Maneuver) to reach you, exposing them during
ascent.</li>
<li><strong>Flanked</strong> (surrounded, caught between enemies):
Grants +1 Advantage to attackers positioned on opposite sides. Created
by coordinated Set Up actions.</li>
<li><strong>Exposed</strong> (caught in open, off-balance): Grants +1
Disadvantage on defense checks. Applied by Partial Success costs or
failed positioning. Cleared by Defend/Withdraw or reaching cover.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environmental Tags:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dim Light</strong> (shadows, fog, smoke): Grants +1
Disadvantage to ranged attacks and perception checks. Grants +1
Advantage to stealth and evasion. Can be created (smoke grenades, kick
up dust) or used (existing conditions).</li>
<li><strong>Cramped</strong> (narrow corridor, dense forest): Restricts
movement and weapon use. Larger weapons (two-handed, polearms) may
suffer +1 Disadvantage. Grappling and close-quarters attacks gain +1
Advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Slick</strong> (oil, ice, wet stone): Grants +1 Disadvantage
on Maneuver checks (shove, trip, reposition). Failed checks result in
<em>Prone</em> condition. Can be created intentionally (spill oil,
freeze water).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Condition Tags:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prone</strong> (knocked down, fallen): Grants +1
Disadvantage on defense and attack checks. Standing costs your action.
Ranged attackers shooting at prone targets suffer +1 Disadvantage
(harder to hit low targets).</li>
<li><strong>Suppressed</strong> (pinned by fire, intimidated): Grants +1
Disadvantage on offensive actions. Created by Set Up actions (covering
fire, threatening presence). Cleared by breaking line of sight or
eliminating the suppressor.</li>
<li><strong>Stunned</strong> (dazed, off-balance): Skip next action
entirely. Applied by critical effects (flash grenades, head trauma,
falling damage). Severe penalty requiring time or aid to clear.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Tags Tactically:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create advantage:</strong> Use Set Up to apply beneficial
tags (<em>Flanked</em>, <em>Suppressed</em>) to enemies or environment
(<em>Slick</em>, <em>Dim Light</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Deny enemy advantage:</strong> Use Maneuver to remove their
cover or reposition away from <em>Flanked</em> situations.</li>
<li><strong>Stack effects:</strong> Combine tags for multiple sources of
Advantage (e.g., <em>Elevated</em> + <em>Flanked</em> = +2
Advantage).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="damage--resolve">Damage &amp; Resolve</h2>
<p>As explained in <a href="#resolve-and-clocks">Combat Overview</a>,
the GM tracks damage using resolve clocks rather than hit points. This
section focuses on <strong>conditions</strong>—persistent states that
impose penalties until cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions</strong> represent lasting effects from combat:
injury, exhaustion, or impairment. Unlike resolve clock progress (which
the GM tracks), conditions are visible to everyone and impose mechanical
penalties.</p>
<p><strong>Common Combat Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bleeding</strong> (injury, open wound): Take 1 pressure
at the start of each round until stabilized. Cleared by first aid (DC 14
check) or magical healing. Multiple bleeding wounds stack—each ticks
pressure separately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exhausted</strong> (fatigue, overexertion): Suffer -1
Disadvantage on physical checks (Strength, Agility). Cleared by rest
(short rest clears 1 level, long rest clears all). Exhaustion
stacks—multiple levels impose cumulative penalties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stunned</strong> (dazed, disoriented): Skip your next
action entirely. Applied by critical effects (head trauma, flash
grenades, sonic attacks). Cleared automatically after 1 round or by ally
assistance (DC 14 check).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clearing Conditions</strong>: Conditions require specific
actions to clear. The GM will tell you what’s needed—first aid for
Bleeding, rest for Exhausted, time or assistance for Stunned. Multiple
conditions stack, making continued fighting dangerous. If you’re
Bleeding and Exhausted, you’re ticking pressure every round AND rolling
with Disadvantage. Use Defend/Withdraw to break contact and get
help.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction vs Mechanics</strong>: The GM describes your state
based on resolve clock progress and conditions. “You’re staggering,
bleeding from a gash on your arm (Bleeding), and you can barely keep
your sword up (Exhausted).” Focus on the fiction—the mechanics support
the narrative, not the other way around.</p>
<h2 id="worked-example">Worked Example</h2>
<p><strong>Scene:</strong> You’re in an alley (<em>Dim Light</em>,
<em>Cramped</em>). Two thugs block the exit. You’re behind <em>Fragile
Cover</em> (stacked crates).</p>
<p><strong>Turn 1 (You):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I use Set Up—I’m laying down cover fire to pin
the front thug.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 14. Full means you Suppress him
(Disadvantage on his next action). Partial means you Suppress him but
degrade your Fragile cover. Roll Agility.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You fire twice, forcing him to duck. He’s
Suppressed. Next?”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2 (Thug):</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The Suppressed thug tries to advance anyway. He
rolls with Disadvantage—fails. He stays pinned. The second thug circles
left, trying to flank you. DC 16 to intercept with a Maneuver.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 14—Fail.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He closes the gap. He’s next to you now—your
cover’s useless at this range. You lose Advantage, and he’s in position
to Strike.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3 (You):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I use Defend/Withdraw—I shove past him and
fall back to the solid wall at the alley mouth.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 14. Full means you break clean. Partial
means you get there but he grabs your coat—pressure ticks. Roll Strength
or Agility.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 17—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You twist free and sprint back. You’re at the
wall, solid cover, and both thugs have to cross open ground to reach
you. What now?”</p>
<p>The example shows Set Up creating advantage, a failed Maneuver
costing position, and Defend/Withdraw resetting the scene. Tags (Dim,
Cramped, Fragile/Solid cover) shaped every choice.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-combat-scenarios">Advanced Combat Scenarios</h2>
<p>These scenarios demonstrate tactical depth: multi-round positioning,
using terrain creatively, and handling multiple opponents. Each shows
both competent play (achieving goals) and optimization opportunities
(maximizing efficiency).</p>
<h3 id="rooftop-standoff">Scenario 1: Rooftop Standoff (Multi-Round
Tactical Play)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You and two allies face three guards on a
flat rooftop. Crates (<em>Fragile Cover</em>) are scattered. The roof
edge is 20 feet away (<em>Fall Risk</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Round 1—Establishing Position:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ally 1 (Ranger):</strong> “I use Set Up—moving to flank the
left guard.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 14. Full means you get there and grant
Advantage to anyone attacking him. Partial means you expose yourself
getting there—you’re <em>Exposed</em> (Disadvantage on defense). Roll
Agility.”</p>
<p><strong>Ally 1 rolls 18—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You circle wide. Anyone attacking that guard
has Advantage now.”</p>
<p><strong>Guard 1:</strong> “I Strike the Ranger with my crossbow.”</p>
<p><strong>GM (rolling for guard):</strong> “He rolls 12 vs your DC
14—Fail. The bolt goes wide. You’re safe.”</p>
<p><strong>You (Fighter):</strong> “I Strike the center guard while he’s
reloading.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 16—he’s alert. Full deals 2 pressure,
Partial 1 pressure but you’re <em>Exposed</em>. Roll Strength.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 19—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You land a solid hit. He staggers back, 2
pressure. His clock is half full now.”</p>
<p><strong>Round 2—Pressing the Advantage:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ally 2 (Rogue):</strong> “I Strike the left guard—the one
who’s flanked.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You have Advantage from the Ranger’s flank. DC
14. Full is 2 pressure, Partial 1 pressure and you’re
<em>Exposed</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Ally 2 rolls 21 (with Advantage)—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Your blade finds the gap. He drops—out of the
fight. Two guards left.”</p>
<p><strong>Guard 2 (center):</strong> “I use Defend/Withdraw—falling
back to <em>Solid Cover</em> behind the rooftop door housing.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He breaks contact cleanly. He’s behind solid
cover now—you’ll need to close or flush him out.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I advance on him, using Maneuver to kick the
crates in his way.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 16—you’re trying to deny his cover. Full
means you scatter the crates and he loses cover. Partial means you move
them but expose yourself.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 15—Partial.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You kick the crates aside, but he fires as you
move. You’re <em>Exposed</em> and take 1 pressure.”</p>
<p><strong>Round 3—Finishing the Fight:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ally 1 (Ranger):</strong> “I use Set Up—covering fire on the
last guard to pin him.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 14. Full <em>Suppresses</em> him
(Disadvantage). Partial Suppresses him but you’re out of arrows after
this.”</p>
<p><strong>Ally 1 rolls 17—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Your arrows force him flat. He’s
<em>Suppressed</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I rush him while he’s pinned—Strike with my
sword.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He’s <em>Suppressed</em> so you have Advantage.
DC 14. Full drops him, Partial deals 2 pressure.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 18 (with Advantage)—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You close fast and strike hard. He goes down.
Fight’s over.”</p>
<p><strong>Tactical Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Round 1:</strong> Positioning mattered. Flanking created
Advantage, aggressive Strike built pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Round 2:</strong> Used Advantage immediately (Rogue’s
Strike). Guard adapted by retreating to better cover. Fighter pressed
but paid a cost (Exposed).</li>
<li><strong>Round 3:</strong> Combined Set Up (Suppress) with Strike to
finish efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optimization Notes:</strong> Ally 2 could have used Set Up in
Round 1 to create <em>even more</em> Advantage for Round 2, but the
aggressive Strike ended the threat faster. Both approaches work—it
depends on your risk tolerance.</p>
<h3 id="high-ground">Scenario 2: The High Ground (Elevation &amp;
Positioning)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re on a stone platform
(<em>Elevated</em>, <em>Solid Cover</em>). Two archers are below in the
courtyard (<em>Open Ground</em>). One tries to climb up.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 1 (You):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I Strike the climber with my bow while he’s
exposed on the ladder.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You have Advantage (Elevation + he’s climbing).
DC 12. Full deals 2 pressure and knocks him off. Partial deals 1
pressure but he keeps climbing.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 19 (with Advantage)—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Your arrow catches him in the shoulder. He
loses grip and falls 10 feet—he’s <em>Stunned</em> and takes 2 pressure.
He’s out for a round.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2 (Archer 1):</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The other archer shoots at you from below. He
has Disadvantage (Elevation + your Solid Cover). He rolls 10 vs your DC
14—Fail. His arrow clatters off the stone.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3 (You):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I Strike the standing archer.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Advantage from Elevation. DC 14. Full is 2
pressure, Partial 1 pressure.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16 (with Advantage)—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Clean hit. He’s hurt bad—2 pressure, clock
nearly full.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 4 (Archer 1):</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He uses Defend/Withdraw—running for the archway
(<em>Solid Cover</em>). DC 14 to intercept with a shot.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 12—Fail.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He makes it. He’s behind cover now, and the
climber is getting up.”</p>
<p><strong>Tactical Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elevation</strong> gave consistent Advantage, making every
shot easier.</li>
<li><strong>Solid Cover</strong> protected you from return fire (enemy
Disadvantage).</li>
<li><strong>Falling damage</strong> (from knocking climber off) turned
one threat into a non-factor for multiple rounds.</li>
<li><strong>Positioning</strong> let you control the fight—they had to
come to you, and doing so exposed them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optimization Notes:</strong> You could have used Set Up on
Turn 3 to <em>Suppress</em> the archer (preventing his retreat) instead
of dealing damage. That’s the tradeoff: immediate pressure vs denying
enemy actions.</p>
<h3 id="outnumbered">Scenario 3: Outnumbered (Three vs One)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re alone in a workshop. Three thugs close
in. The room has <em>Cramped</em> spaces (workbenches), a <em>Slick</em>
oil spill, and a door (<em>Exit</em>) 15 feet away.</p>
<p><strong>Turn 1 (You):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I use Set Up—kicking over the lantern to
spread fire and create chaos.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 14. Full creates <em>Burning</em> terrain
(Disadvantage to anyone crossing it, 1 pressure per round if you stay).
Partial creates <em>Smoke</em> (obscures vision, Disadvantage to
ranged). Roll Agility.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The oil ignites. There’s a wall of fire between
you and two of them now. They’ll have to go around or risk crossing. The
third thug is on your side of the fire.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 2 (Thug 1, on your side):</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He rushes you—Strike with a club. You’re in
<em>Cramped</em> terrain. He rolls 15 vs your DC 14—Partial Success for
him.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He swings wild, connects but stumbles into a
workbench. You both take 1 pressure.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 3 (You):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I use Maneuver—shove him into the
<em>Slick</em> oil spill.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 14. Full knocks him <em>Prone</em> in the
oil (Disadvantage on his next action). Partial moves him there but you
lose balance—<em>Exposed</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 17—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You heave him backward. He goes down hard in
the slick, struggling to stand. He’s <em>Prone</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 4 (Thug 2 &amp; 3, across fire):</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “One tries to circle left around the fire. The
other tries to leap it. Leaping is DC 16 or he takes 2 pressure and ends
<em>Prone</em> on your side.”</p>
<p><strong>GM (rolling for Thug 3):</strong> “He rolls 13—Fail. He
stumbles into the flames, takes 2 pressure, and lands <em>Prone</em> at
your feet. Thug 2 is still circling.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn 5 (You):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I use Defend/Withdraw—I sprint for the door
and bolt it behind me.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 14. Full means you get out clean. Partial
means you get out but one follows you through.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 18—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You’re out, door slammed and barred. They’re
trapped in a burning room. You win.”</p>
<p><strong>Tactical Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set Up</strong> (creating <em>Burning</em> terrain) split
the enemies, turning 3v1 into 1v1 temporarily.</li>
<li><strong>Maneuver</strong> (shove into <em>Slick</em> terrain)
neutralized the immediate threat (<em>Prone</em> = Disadvantage).</li>
<li><strong>Defend/Withdraw</strong> (escape) was the win condition—you
didn’t need to fight, just survive and leave.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental tags</strong> (<em>Cramped</em>,
<em>Slick</em>, <em>Burning</em>) were more effective than direct
combat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optimization Notes:</strong> You could have used Strike to
finish Thug 1 while he was <em>Prone</em>, but escaping was safer and
faster. Against overwhelming odds, changing the situation (environment,
escape) beats standing and fighting.</p>

<h1 id="ph-exploration-social-play">Exploration &amp; Social Play</h1>
<h2 id="exploration-overview">Exploration Overview</h2>
<p>Exploration covers everything outside combat: investigating crime
scenes, navigating dangerous terrain, deciphering ancient texts, picking
locks, tracking suspects, or solving puzzles. You use the same
mechanics—DCs, outcome tiers, tags, clocks—but the focus shifts from
immediate violence to problem-solving, discovery, and momentum building.
The GM frames stakes, you declare actions, you roll, and the fiction
moves forward.</p>
<h2 id="investigation--discovery">Investigation &amp; Discovery</h2>
<p>When investigating, describe what you’re doing and seeking. “I search
the desk for hidden compartments” or “I interview witnesses for
inconsistencies.”</p>
<p>The GM sets a DC based on how well-hidden or complex the information
is. On Full, you find clear evidence or breakthrough. On Partial, you
find something useful with a complication—time passes, someone notices,
clue incomplete. On Fail, learn nothing new or trigger a
complication.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Clocks</strong> track investigation goals: “Identify
Culprit” or “Decode Ritual.” Successful checks tick progress. Fill the
clock, achieve breakthrough. <strong>Pressure Clocks</strong> track
danger: “Guards Return” or “Evidence Destroyed.” Partial/Fail tick
pressure, raising stakes.</p>
<p>Use relevant skills—Perception for details, Research for lore,
Insight for reading people. The GM might grant Advantage for expert
tools, contacts, or prep time.</p>
<h2 id="social-interaction">Social Interaction</h2>
<p>Social scenes—persuasion, deception, negotiation—use the same
structure. Declare intent and approach. “I convince the merchant to
lower his price by appealing to shared history” or “I deceive the guard
by forging confidence.”</p>
<p><strong>Persuasion:</strong> On Full, change their mind or gain
trust. On Partial, they’re swayed but want something in return. On Fail,
they reject or grow suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Deception:</strong> On Full, they believe you. On Partial,
they believe but doubt a detail or ask follow-ups. On Fail, they see
through the lie.</p>
<p><strong>Reading NPCs:</strong> Use Insight to read intentions, detect
lies, gauge mood. On Full, GM tells what they want and hide. On Partial,
partial read or they notice you studying them.</p>
<p><strong>Social Contests:</strong> When both have goals (debate,
negotiation), both roll. Higher wins. GM pre-states outcomes for each
side. Use when neither dominates.</p>
<h3 id="negotiation-tactics">Negotiation Tactics</h3>
<p>Negotiation is about finding leverage and reading the room. Effective
negotiators identify what the other party values, then frame their offer
to align with those values.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Leverage:</strong> Before negotiating, use Insight
to read the NPC’s priorities. Are they <em>Profit-Minded</em>? Offer
ongoing revenue. <em>Honor-Bound</em>? Appeal to duty or reputation.
<em>Desperate</em>? Offer immediate relief. Leverage isn’t always
gold—information, access, or protection can be more valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Frame Your Offer:</strong> Present your proposal in terms of
their goals, not yours. Don’t say “I need safe passage”—say “You get
steady intel on caravans if you let us through.” Make it easy for them
to say yes by showing mutual benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Round Negotiations:</strong> Complex negotiations
unfold over multiple rolls. Use progress clocks to track “Deal Secured”
or “Trust Established.” Each round represents an exchange: you make an
offer, they counter, you adapt. Winning early rounds grants Advantage
later (they’re more receptive). Losing early rounds means you’re
negotiating uphill—you’ll need bigger concessions or better leverage to
recover.</p>
<p><strong>When to Walk Away:</strong> Not every negotiation succeeds.
If the NPC’s demands are unreasonable or their terms unacceptable,
walking away is valid. Sometimes failed negotiation creates new
opportunities—rival factions, alternative routes, or leverage to revisit
the deal later with better position.</p>
<h3 id="deception-and-lying">Deception and Lying</h3>
<p>Deception is high-risk, high-reward. Successful lies open doors,
failed lies burn bridges and create enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Craft Believable Lies:</strong> Simple lies work better than
complex ones. “I’m lost” is easier to sell than “I’m the duke’s secret
envoy carrying urgent correspondence.” Ground lies in partial
truths—real details mixed with fabrication are harder to spot. The GM
may grant Advantage if your lie aligns with observable facts.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment:</strong> Once you commit to a lie, maintain it.
Contradicting yourself or hesitating raises suspicion. If an NPC asks
follow-up questions (Partial Success consequence), have answers ready.
Improvise details that support the fiction you’ve created.</p>
<p><strong>Failed Deception:</strong> When a lie fails, consequences
compound. The NPC doesn’t just reject the lie—they remember you lied.
Future social interactions with them may face Disadvantage
(<em>Distrusted</em> tag). Groups talk—lying to one guard might poison
your reputation with the entire faction. Weigh the risk: is the
potential gain worth permanently damaging trust?</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives to Lying:</strong> Consider misdirection,
selective truth, or omission. You don’t have to lie outright—letting
them assume something false is often safer than active deception. “I’m
here to see someone” (true) lets them assume you have legitimate
business (false assumption, their error).</p>
<h2 id="using-tools--resources">Using Tools &amp; Resources</h2>
<p>Outside combat, you can spend resources to shift position:</p>
<p><strong>Gear:</strong> Expert tools (lockpicks, climbing gear,
medical kit) grant Advantage or reduce DCs. Improvised tools impose
Disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> Spending extra time grants Advantage on
investigation, crafting, or preparation. Rushing imposes
Disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>Contacts &amp; Favors:</strong> Call in a contact for
information, access, or assistance. The GM might grant Advantage or tick
a progress clock directly. Using favors has costs—you owe them, or they
ask for something in return.</p>
<p>Tell the GM what you’re spending and how it helps. They’ll decide if
it grants Advantage, reduces the DC, or bypasses the check entirely.</p>
<h2 id="pacing--momentum">Pacing &amp; Momentum</h2>
<p>Exploration and social scenes use clocks and tags for structure:</p>
<p><strong>Clocks</strong> pace progress and pressure. “Locate
Safehouse” (progress) vs. “Hunters Close In” (pressure). Clocks make
abstract goals concrete—see progress accumulating and danger
mounting.</p>
<p><strong>Tags</strong> describe environmental or situational states.
<em>Crowded Market</em> grants Advantage to blend but Disadvantage to
chase. <em>Dim Archives</em> makes research harder but offers privacy.
<em>Suspicious Guards</em> raises DCs in that area. GM names tags; you
decide how to use or avoid.</p>
<p>Between action and consequence, fiction breathes. GM describes what
changed, you react, momentum carries forward.</p>
<h2 id="worked-examples">Worked Examples</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-investigation">Example 1: Investigation (Searching a
Crime Scene)</h3>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I search the office for evidence—letters,
bloodstains, anything that points to the killer.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “DC 14. The room’s ransacked
(<em>Disorganized</em> tag—Disadvantage). Full means you find a key
letter. Partial means you find something but knock over a lamp—pressure
ticks. Roll Perception.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16—Full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Beneath papers you find a sealed letter with
the rival house’s crest. Progress clock ‘Identify Culprit’ ticks to 2/4.
What now?”</p>
<h3 id="example-2-social">Example 2: Social (Negotiating with a
Merchant)</h3>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I want to convince the merchant to sell us the
map at a fair price by pointing out we’re his best chance to recover
stolen goods.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “She’s skeptical but listening. DC 16. Partial
means she agrees but wants a cut of what you recover. Roll
Presence.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 14—Partial.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “She leans back. ‘Fine. Fifty silver for the
map, but I want ten percent of any treasure you find using it.’ Do you
agree, or push back?”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I’ll take it. We shake on it.”</p>
<p>Both examples show intent, approach, DC, outcomes, and how the
fiction moves forward. Investigation used clocks; social used
trade-offs. Same mechanics, different context.</p>
<h2 id="social-contest-examples">Social Contest Examples</h2>
<p>Social contests occur when both sides have clear, conflicting goals
and neither dominates. Both roll, and the higher result wins. The GM
pre-states outcomes before rolls to clarify stakes.</p>
<h3 id="debate-public-forum">Contest 1: Debate (Public Forum)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re debating the town council over
resource allocation. They want to fortify the walls; you want to fund
the healer’s guild. The crowd is listening (<em>Divided Audience</em>
tag—no inherent Advantage).</p>
<p><strong>Round 1—Opening Arguments:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I appeal to compassion—remind them we lost
three families to plague last winter while the walls stood
untouched.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The council speaker counters that walls saved
them from raiders last summer. Both roll Presence. Winner sways the
crowd—progress clock ticks toward their goal. Full means strong sway,
Partial means weak sway but you expose a weakness in your argument.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 18 (Presence +3 = 21).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Council Speaker rolls 16 (Presence +2 = 18).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You win this exchange. Your words hit
home—several council members nod. Progress clock ‘Sway Council’ ticks to
1/4. But the Speaker isn’t done.”</p>
<p><strong>Round 2—Rebuttals:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Council Speaker:</strong> “The Speaker pivots—‘Compassion is
noble, but raiders killed six families two years ago. Dead healers can’t
help anyone.’”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He’s using fear now. Both roll Presence again.
Winner consolidates their position. If you win, tick progress. If he
wins, he ticks his clock ‘Maintain Status Quo.’”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 14 (Presence +3 = 17).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Council Speaker rolls 19 (Presence +2 = 21).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He wins. The crowd murmurs agreement—fear is
powerful. His clock ticks to 1/4. The crowd is split now. You need a
stronger approach.”</p>
<p><strong>Round 3—Final Appeals:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I call on a healer from the crowd to testify
about preventable deaths. I’m using my Compassion proficiency to grant
myself Advantage.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Bold move. You have Advantage. Winner takes the
debate—fills their clock to 4/4 or gets 3/4 ticks. Loser gets
nothing.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 20 (with Advantage, Presence +3 = 23).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Council Speaker rolls 15 (Presence +2 = 17).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The healer’s testimony breaks through. Several
council members wipe their eyes. Your clock fills to 4/4. The council
votes to fund the healer’s guild first, then consider walls later. You
won.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple rounds</strong> let both sides build arguments and
react.</li>
<li><strong>Progress clocks</strong> track who’s winning the crowd’s
favor.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage from proficiencies or allies</strong> (healer
testimony) can turn the tide.</li>
<li><strong>Stakes were clear:</strong> Council funding priorities, not
life-or-death but meaningful to characters and community.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interrogation">Contest 2: Interrogation (Extracting
Information)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re interrogating a captured smuggler. He
knows where the shipment is hidden, but he’s loyal to his boss
(<em>Loyal</em> tag—Disadvantage to intimidation). You need the location
before his crew realizes he’s missing. Pressure clock “Crew Realizes”
starts at 0/4.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1—Intimidation vs. Resolve:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I slam my fist on the table and lean in—‘Tell
me where the shipment is, or you’ll rot in the duke’s dungeon.’”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He’s scared but loyal. You roll Presence
(intimidation). He rolls Resolve. Winner controls the exchange. If you
win, he cracks—reveals partial info and you tick progress. If he wins,
he holds firm, and pressure ticks (crew is looking for him).”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16 (Presence +2 = 18).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Smuggler rolls 17 (Resolve +3 = 20).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He spits at your feet. ‘I don’t talk to thugs.’
He’s tougher than he looks. Pressure ticks to 1/4—his crew is starting
to ask where he went. Try something else.”</p>
<p><strong>Round 2—Deception vs. Insight:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I change tactics—‘Look, your boss left you to
hang. He’s already selling the shipment and keeping your cut. I can
protect you if you cooperate.’”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You’re lying, but he doesn’t know that. You
roll Presence (deception). He rolls Insight. Winner controls the
narrative. If you win, he believes you and reveals the location. If he
wins, he sees through it and shuts down completely.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 19 (Presence +2 = 21).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Smuggler rolls 12 (Insight +1 = 13).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “His face falls. ‘He… left me? That bastard.’ He
tells you the shipment is hidden in the old mill by the river. You got
what you needed.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different approaches</strong> (intimidation vs. deception)
use different skills. Adapt when one fails.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure clock</strong> added time urgency—failure has
escalating costs.</li>
<li><strong>NPC traits</strong> (<em>Loyal</em> tag) shaped
difficulty—intimidation faced Disadvantage, but deception exploited his
loyalty (betrayal hurts more when you’re loyal).</li>
<li><strong>Stakes escalated:</strong> First round was “does he crack,”
second was “can you trick him before time runs out.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="negotiation-multi-party">Contest 3: Negotiation (Multi-Party
Stakes)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re negotiating safe passage through gang
territory. The gang leader (<em>Ruthless</em>, <em>Profit-Minded</em>
tags) wants payment. You want free passage and future access. A rival
merchant is also bidding for the gang’s favor.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1—Establishing Value:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I offer information about a merchant convoy
passing through next week—worth more than gold if they move fast.”</p>
<p><strong>Rival Merchant:</strong> “I offer 200 gold now, no
strings.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Both roll Presence. The gang leader picks the
better deal based on rolls and fiction. Winner gets Advantage in the
next round (gang leader is inclined toward them).”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 17 (Presence +2 = 19).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rival Merchant rolls 14 (Presence +3 = 17).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The leader leans forward. ‘Information… that
could be worth five convoys if I play it right.’ He’s interested. You
have Advantage next round.”</p>
<p><strong>Round 2—Sealing the Deal:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You (with Advantage):</strong> “I sweeten it—offer to split
the convoy haul 60/40 in his favor, plus guaranteed intel on future
shipments.”</p>
<p><strong>Rival Merchant:</strong> “I raise to 300 gold and throw in a
crate of weapons.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Final bids. Both roll Presence. Winner secures
the deal. Loser is out.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 20 (with Advantage, Presence +2 = 22).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rival Merchant rolls 18 (Presence +3 = 21).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The leader grins. ‘Ongoing profit beats
one-time gold. You’ve got a deal, friend.’ He offers his hand. The rival
merchant storms out, furious.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing interests</strong> (you vs. rival merchant) create
three-way tension.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple rounds</strong> let you build value and respond to
competition.</li>
<li><strong>Fiction matters:</strong> Your offer (future profit) aligned
with his <em>Profit-Minded</em> tag, giving you a narrative edge even
though the merchant had higher Presence.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage from winning Round 1</strong> made the difference
in Round 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fast-talk">Contest 4: Fast-Talk (Escaping Suspicion)</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re caught sneaking through a noble’s
estate. A guard confronts you (<em>Suspicious</em>, <em>By-the-Book</em>
tags). You need to talk your way out before he calls reinforcements.
Pressure clock “Guards Arrive” starts at 0/4.</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I immediately act indignant—‘I’m Lady Elowen’s
assistant! She sent me to retrieve her correspondence. How dare you
question me!’”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He’s uncertain. You roll Presence (deception).
He rolls Insight. Winner controls the situation. If you win, he buys it
and lets you go. If he wins, he sees through it and calls for
backup—pressure ticks to 3/4 immediately.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 13 (Presence +2 = 15).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guard rolls 16 (Insight +2 = 18).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He narrows his eyes. ‘Lady Elowen’s assistant
would know she’s out of town.’ He raises his whistle. Pressure ticks to
3/4. You’ve got one more chance before guards flood the hall.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I change tactics—‘Fine, you caught me. I’m
here for a different reason. Let me show you something valuable.’ I
offer a bribe (50 gold) and use Streetwise proficiency for
Advantage.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Now you’re appealing to greed. You have
Advantage. You roll Presence (persuasion). He rolls Resolve. If you win,
he pockets the gold and pretends he didn’t see you. If he loses, he
takes the gold AND calls the guards (he’s <em>By-the-Book</em> but not
immune to greed). Stakes are high.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 18 (with Advantage, Presence +2 = 20).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guard rolls 14 (Resolve +1 = 15).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He looks at the gold, then at you. He pockets
it. ‘I didn’t see anyone. You have two minutes to disappear.’ You sprint
for the exit.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failed first round</strong> escalated stakes but didn’t end
the contest.</li>
<li><strong>Adapting approach</strong> (deception → bribery) changed the
dynamic.</li>
<li><strong>NPC traits</strong> (<em>By-the-Book</em>) made deception
harder, but greed was a universal lever.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure clock</strong> created urgency—every round
mattered.</li>
<li><strong>Risk/reward:</strong> Offering bribe could have backfired
(lose gold AND get caught), but it was your best remaining option.</li>

<h3 id="investigation-poisoned-heir">Investigation: The Poisoned
Heir</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> The duke’s son has been poisoned. You have
until dawn to identify the culprit before the assassins flee the city.
Progress clock “Identify Assassin” (0/6). Pressure clock “Assassins
Flee” (0/4, ticks each scene).</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1—Crime Scene Investigation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I examine the heir’s chambers for
evidence—poison vials, signs of forced entry, anything unusual.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The room is luxurious but chaotic
(<em>Ransacked</em> tag—Disadvantage to search). DC 16, Perception. Full
means you find key evidence and tick progress twice. Partial means you
find something but waste time—pressure ticks.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 18 (Perception +3 = 21)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Under the bed you find a shattered vial with a
distinctive seal—House Vyreth’s personal apothecary. Progress ticks to
2/6. The heir’s window is slightly ajar—someone left in a hurry. What
now?”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2—Interviewing Witnesses:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I question the guards who were on duty. Who
entered the heir’s chambers tonight?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The guards are nervous (<em>Evasive</em>
tag—they fear punishment). DC 15, Insight to read whether they’re hiding
something or just scared. Partial means they reveal some truth but you
have to press them—pressure ticks.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 13 (Insight +2 = 15)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The senior guard cracks: ‘A servant brought
wine at midnight. I didn’t recognize her, but she had the seal—I thought
she was legitimate.’ Progress ticks to 3/6. You have a description now:
hooded, slight build, moves quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 3—Tracking the Assassin:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I head to House Vyreth’s apothecary to
confront them about the vial.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “It’s late, but lights are on. The apothecary is
burning records (<em>Panicked</em> tag—Advantage to intimidate). DC 14,
Presence (intimidation) to make them talk before they finish. Fail means
they destroy evidence—progress lost.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16 (Presence +1 = 17)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You burst in. The apothecary drops the ledger
into the fire but you snatch it. Inside: recent sale to ‘Lady
Mirelle’—the duchess’s rival. Progress ticks to 5/6. Pressure ticks to
2/4—assassins are preparing to flee.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 4—Confronting the Culprit:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I rush to Lady Mirelle’s estate and demand
entry, waving the ledger.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Her guards block you (<em>Loyal</em>
tag—Disadvantage to intimidate). But you have hard evidence. DC 17,
Presence (persuasion or intimidation) to get past them. Partial means
they let you in but alert Mirelle—she has time to prepare her
defense.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 19 (Presence +1 = 20)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The guards step aside, cowed by the evidence.
You find Mirelle in her study, already packing. She freezes when she
sees you. Progress ticks to 6/6. Clock complete—you’ve identified and
cornered the assassin before dawn. The duke’s guards arrive to arrest
her.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple scenes</strong> build toward goal through progress
clock</li>
<li><strong>Pressure clock</strong> creates time urgency across
scenes</li>
<li><strong>Environmental tags</strong> modify difficulty and create
tactical choices</li>
<li><strong>Full vs. Partial</strong> outcomes affect pacing—Full
advances faster, Partial adds complications</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation</strong> required—each scene used different
approach (search, interview, intimidate, persuade)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discovery-sunken-temple">Discovery: Exploring the Sunken
Temple</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re exploring a flooded temple rumored to
hold an ancient artifact. Progress clock “Find Artifact” (0/6). Pressure
clock “Temple Collapses” (0/4, ticks when you disturb structure).</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1—Navigating Flooded Corridors:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I wade through the water, searching for
passages that lead deeper.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The temple is dark and waterlogged (<em>Low
Visibility</em>, <em>Unstable Footing</em> tags—Disadvantage to
Perception and Athletics). DC 15, Perception to find a safe route. Fail
means you disturb rubble—pressure ticks.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 12 (Perception +3 = 15)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You spot a corridor with relatively intact
stonework. Progress ticks to 1/6. As you wade forward, you hear distant
groaning—the structure is unstable. Proceed carefully.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2—Deciphering Ancient Murals:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I examine the murals on the walls. Do they
show where the artifact is kept?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The murals are faded (<em>Worn Carvings</em>
tag—Disadvantage). DC 18, Research (ancient lore) to interpret them.
Partial means you get a clue but misread a warning—pressure ticks.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 14 (Research +4 = 18)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The murals depict a ritual chamber on the
lowest level, guarded by ‘the Keeper.’ Progress ticks to 3/6. You also
notice warnings about ‘the water that does not sleep’—something lives
here.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 3—Bypassing the Guardian Statue:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I reach a chamber with a massive stone
guardian blocking the path. Can I climb around it or find a mechanism to
move it?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The statue’s eyes glow faintly—it’s warded
(<em>Magical Sentinel</em> tag). DC 16, Technical (Arcane Lore or
Engineering) to disable it. Fail means it activates—you’ll have to fight
or flee, and pressure ticks heavily.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 15 (Technical +2 = 17)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You identify the warding sigil and trace a
counter-pattern in the water. The glow fades. Progress ticks to 4/6. The
passage beyond descends into murky darkness.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 4—The Flooded Ritual Chamber:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I dive into the chamber, searching for the
artifact.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “It’s fully submerged (<em>Underwater</em>
tag—Disadvantage to everything, and you’re holding your breath). DC 17,
Perception to spot the artifact quickly. Partial means you find it but
something disturbs you—pressure ticks and you might face a threat.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16 (Perception +3 = 19)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You spot the artifact on a pedestal—glowing
faintly. You grab it and kick toward the surface. Progress ticks to 6/6.
The temple shudders violently as you surface. You sprint for the exit as
water surges behind you. You emerge just as the entrance collapses. You
made it—artifact in hand.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental tags</strong> create escalating challenges
(low visibility → underwater → collapsing)</li>
<li><strong>Pressure clock</strong> represents structural instability,
not enemies</li>
<li><strong>Skill diversity</strong> required (Perception, Research,
Technical)—generalists shine here</li>
<li><strong>Success pacing</strong> controlled by DC difficulty and
progress clock size</li>
<li><strong>Failure consequences</strong> clear at each step—creates
meaningful tension</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tracking-smugglers-trail">Tracking: The Smuggler’s Trail</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re tracking a smuggling crew through
wilderness to their hidden camp. Progress clock “Locate Camp” (0/4).
Pressure clock “Smugglers Spot You” (0/4, ticks if you fail checks or
make noise).</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1—Finding the Trail:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I search for tracks leaving the town—wagon
ruts, footprints, anything that shows which way they went.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The ground is muddy from recent rain (<em>Soft
Terrain</em> tag—Advantage to tracking). DC 13, Survival. Full means
clear trail, progress ticks. Partial means you find it but lose
time—pressure ticks.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 15 (Survival +2 = 17)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Deep wagon ruts lead west into the forest.
Progress ticks to 1/4. The tracks are fresh—they passed through within
the hour.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2—Silent Pursuit:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I follow the trail quietly, staying hidden in
case they have scouts.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The forest is dense (<em>Heavy Cover</em>
tag—Advantage to Stealth). DC 14, Stealth to stay undetected. Fail means
they hear you—pressure ticks to 3/4 immediately and they set an
ambush.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 18 (Stealth +3 = 21)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You move like a shadow. Progress ticks to 2/4.
Ahead, you hear voices—you’re close.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 3—Scouting the Camp:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I creep to the edge of their camp and observe.
How many are there? What are they guarding?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The camp is busy (<em>Crowded</em>, <em>Alert
Sentries</em> tags—Disadvantage to Perception). DC 16 to count enemies
and spot the cargo without being seen. Partial means you get some info
but a sentry glances your way—pressure ticks.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 13 (Perception +3 = 16)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Six smugglers, two on watch. The cargo: crates
marked with noble seals—stolen goods. Progress ticks to 4/4. You’ve
located the camp and gathered intel. Pressure clock at 0/4 still—they
don’t know you’re here. Do you retreat to report, or act now?”</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progression through stages</strong>: Find trail → Follow
quietly → Scout camp</li>
<li><strong>Pressure clock</strong> tracks detection risk, not time</li>
<li><strong>Environmental tags shift</strong> (Soft Terrain → Heavy
Cover → Crowded)—each scene has different tactical considerations</li>
<li><strong>Information gathering</strong> as goal, not just “find the
place”</li>
<li><strong>Player choice</strong> at end—success creates options
(report, ambush, negotiate)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-solving-locked-archive">Problem-Solving: The Locked
Archive</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You need to retrieve a document from a
noble’s archive before morning. Progress clock “Retrieve Document”
(0/4). Pressure clock “Guards Patrol Returns” (0/4, ticks each scene or
on Partial/Fail).</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1—Bypassing the Lock:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I examine the archive door. It’s a complex
mechanical lock. Can I pick it?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “It’s a high-quality lock (<em>Master
Craftsman</em> tag—Disadvantage). DC 17, Technical (Security). Partial
means you open it but it takes time—pressure ticks.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 14 (Technical +4 = 18)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Your lockpicks find the tumblers. The door
opens silently. Progress ticks to 1/4. Inside: rows of shelves in dim
light.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2—Navigating the Archive:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I search for the document—‘Contract of House
Verath, dated 15 years ago.’ Where would that be filed?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The archive uses an old filing system
(<em>Archaic Organization</em> tag—Disadvantage to Research). DC 15,
Research. Fail means you waste time and make noise—pressure ticks
twice.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16 (Research +2 = 18)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You decipher the system: contracts are filed by
house, chronologically. Progress ticks to 2/4. You locate the Verath
section—third shelf from the top.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 3—Retrieving the Document:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I climb up carefully to retrieve the
contract.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The shelf is high and old (<em>Unstable
Furniture</em> tag). DC 13, Athletics to climb without knocking things
over. Fail means loud crash—pressure ticks to 4/4 immediately (guards
investigate).”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 15 (Athletics +1 = 16)—Full Success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You scale the shelf like a cat, retrieve the
contract, and descend. Progress ticks to 4/4. You have the document.
Pressure at 0/4 still—guards haven’t noticed. Time to leave.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I exit the same way I came, locking the door
behind me so they don’t notice the break-in.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Smart. You relock the door (no check needed—you
already proved your skill). You slip into the night with the contract.
Mission accomplished without raising alarm.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layered challenges</strong>: Lock → Navigation → Retrieval →
Escape</li>
<li><strong>Different skills</strong> for each obstacle (Technical,
Research, Athletics)</li>
<li><strong>Pressure clock</strong> represents time limit and detection
risk combined</li>
<li><strong>Full Success pacing</strong> allows smooth heist when player
succeeds consistently</li>
<li><strong>Optional choice</strong> to relock door shows player agency
(could rush, or be thorough)</li>

<h1 id="ph-conditions-tags-and-status">Conditions, Tags, and Status</h1>
<h2 id="understanding-conditions--tags">Understanding Conditions &amp;
Tags</h2>
<p><strong>Tags</strong> describe the environment or situation: terrain,
lighting, cover. They’re external to your character. <em>Dim Light</em>,
<em>Slick</em>, <em>Fragile Cover</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions</strong> describe your character’s state:
injuries, status effects, temporary afflictions. <em>Exhausted</em>,
<em>Restrained</em>, <em>Bleeding</em>, <em>Stunned</em>.</p>
<p>Tags affect what you can do in a space. Conditions affect you
wherever you go. Both grant Advantage or Disadvantage, impose narrative
limits, or create tactical opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="common-environmental-tags">Common Environmental Tags</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dim Light:</strong> Advantage to stealth; Disadvantage to
ranged attacks and detailed observation.</li>
<li><strong>Slick:</strong> Disadvantage on movement and maneuvers
requiring balance (ice, oil, wet stone).</li>
<li><strong>Cramped:</strong> Hinders movement; increases fall risk;
limits large weapons or sweeping actions.</li>
<li><strong>Fragile Cover:</strong> Grants Advantage to defense but
degrades on Partial Success or repeated use.</li>
<li><strong>Solid Cover:</strong> Reliable protection; grants Advantage
to defense without degrading.</li>
<li><strong>Elevated:</strong> Advantage on ranged attacks; forces
opponents to climb or find alternate routes.</li>
<li><strong>Crowded:</strong> Advantage to blend in or lose pursuit;
Disadvantage to chase or spot targets.</li>
<li><strong>Hazardous:</strong> Environmental danger (fire, acid,
collapsing floor); risk of damage or conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Obscured:</strong> Vision blocked (fog, smoke, darkness);
Disadvantage to ranged attacks and navigation.</li>
<li><strong>Unstable:</strong> Risk of collapse, shifting terrain, or
loss of footing; movement requires checks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-conditions">Common Conditions</h2>
<p>Conditions represent your character’s state—injuries, status effects,
or temporary afflictions that follow you regardless of location.</p>
<h3 id="physical-conditions">Physical Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Exhausted:</strong> Physical or mental fatigue. Disadvantage
on physical actions (combat, athletics, endurance). Clear via rest (full
night) or aid (stimulants, magic, medical treatment).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> After fighting through the ruins for hours,
you’re <em>Exhausted</em>. When the patrol attacks, you have
Disadvantage on all Strike and Maneuver actions. Resting at camp for 8
hours clears the condition.</p>
<p><strong>Bleeding:</strong> Active wound requiring immediate
treatment. Time pressure—worsens if ignored. Clear via first aid (ally
uses medkit, DC 14), magic, or rest after stabilization.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The bandit’s blade cuts deep—you’re
<em>Bleeding</em>. Each scene that passes without treatment, your
resolve clock ticks. An ally uses their medkit (First Aid skill + RSN,
DC 14) to stabilize you. Condition clears.</p>
<p><strong>Poisoned:</strong> Toxin affecting you. Effects vary by
poison type (Disadvantage on actions, ongoing resolve clock damage,
paralysis). Duration varies. Clear via antidote, medical aid, or time
(if non-lethal).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The trap needle injects venom—you’re
<em>Poisoned</em>. Disadvantage on all actions for the next hour unless
you find an antidote. Your medic identifies the toxin and administers
the cure. Condition clears.</p>
<p><strong>Restrained:</strong> Movement limited by bonds (ropes,
chains), grapple, or obstacle (pinned under debris). Can’t move freely.
Clear via breaking free (MIG check), ally assistance, or time.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The guard grapples you—you’re
<em>Restrained</em>. You can’t move or Maneuver. On your turn, roll MIG
vs. their MIG to break free (DC 16). Ally Strikes the guard to force
them to release you. Condition clears.</p>
<h3 id="mentalcombat-conditions">Mental/Combat Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Stunned:</strong> Dazed or disoriented from impact. Can’t act
next turn. Clears automatically after one turn (no action required).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The concussion grenade explodes
nearby—you’re <em>Stunned</em>. You lose your next action. The turn
after, the condition clears automatically and you can act normally.</p>
<p><strong>Dazed:</strong> Disoriented, struggling to focus.
Disadvantage on perception, reaction, and complex tasks. Clears after
one turn or with ally assistance (snapping you out of it).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The flash-bang disorients you—you’re
<em>Dazed</em>. Disadvantage on Investigation and Perception checks.
Your ally shouts and shakes you—condition clears immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Frightened:</strong> Fear of visible threat. Disadvantage on
actions while threat is in sight. Clear by removing/defeating threat,
rallying (ally assistance or self-discipline check), or breaking line of
sight.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The dragon roars—you’re
<em>Frightened</em>. Disadvantage on all actions while it’s visible.
Your ally’s rallying speech lets you roll PRE, DC 14, to shake it off.
You succeed—condition clears.</p>
<p><strong>Suppressed:</strong> Under pressure from covering fire,
intimidation, or overwhelming force. Disadvantage on next action. Clears
after acting or repositioning to safety.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Automatic gunfire pins you down—you’re
<em>Suppressed</em>. Disadvantage on your next action. You use Defend to
reposition behind solid cover. Condition clears.</p>
<h3 id="tactical-conditions">Tactical Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Exposed:</strong> Out of cover, vulnerable. Disadvantage to
defense. Attackers gain Advantage against you. Clear by moving to cover
or breaking line of sight.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> You’re caught in the open courtyard—you’re
<em>Exposed</em>. Enemies have Advantage on attacks against you. You
Sprint to the pillar (Defend action). Condition clears once behind
cover.</p>
<p><strong>Marked:</strong> Tracked or targeted by enemy. Opponent gains
Advantage on attacks against you. Clear by breaking contact
(Defend/Withdraw to different zone) or eliminating the marker.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The sniper has you in their sights—you’re
<em>Marked</em>. They have Advantage on all ranged attacks against you.
You use Defend to break line of sight by ducking into the building.
Condition clears.</p>
<h2 id="using-status-in-play">Using Status in Play</h2>
<p><strong>Leverage Tags:</strong> Use environmental features to your
advantage. Fight in <em>Dim Light</em> for stealth. Use
<em>Elevated</em> positions for ranged attacks. Create <em>Fragile
Cover</em> with Set Up actions.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Conditions:</strong> Prioritize dangerous conditions.
<em>Bleeding</em> and <em>Poisoned</em> create time pressure.
<em>Restrained</em> and <em>Exposed</em> make you vulnerable. Use
actions, resources, or allies to clear them.</p>
<p><strong>Apply Conditions:</strong> Set Up and Maneuver actions can
apply conditions to opponents. Trip someone to make them
<em>Exposed</em>. Suppress them with covering fire. Force them into
<em>Hazardous</em> terrain.</p>
<p>Status effects drive tactical choices. They’re tools for creating and
solving problems.</p>
<h2 id="combining-tags-for-compound-effects">Combining Tags for Compound
Effects</h2>
<p>Tags and conditions stack to create complex tactical situations:</p>
<h3 id="favorable-combinations-use-these">Favorable Combinations (Use
These)</h3>
<p><strong>Elevated + Solid Cover:</strong> Advantage on ranged attacks
while protected. Ideal for archers and snipers.</p>
<p><strong>Dim Light + Stealth Proficiency:</strong> Advantage to hide
and ambush. Use Set Up to create <em>Dim Light</em> (knock out torches,
trigger smoke).</p>
<p><strong>Cramped + Ranged Attacks:</strong> If enemies are stuck in
tight space, ranged attacks from outside avoid the <em>Cramped</em>
penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Hazardous + Maneuver:</strong> Shove enemies into fire, acid,
collapsing floors. Environmental damage without spending Strike
actions.</p>
<h3 id="unfavorable-combinations-avoid-these">Unfavorable Combinations
(Avoid These)</h3>
<p><strong>Slick + Cramped:</strong> Double Disadvantage on movement and
maneuvers. Falling risk extreme. Get out fast or fight defensively.</p>
<p><strong>Exposed + Elevated:</strong> Elevated grants Advantage to
<em>attackers</em>, not you. If you’re <em>Exposed</em> on high ground,
you’re a target.</p>
<p><strong>Obscured + Ranged Combat:</strong> Disadvantage to ranged
attacks in fog/smoke/darkness. Switch to melee or wait for
visibility.</p>
<p><strong>Restrained + Hazardous:</strong> Can’t move away from danger.
Priority: clear <em>Restrained</em> immediately.</p>
<h2 id="tactical-uses-of-tags">Tactical Uses of Tags</h2>
<h3 id="creating-tags-with-set-up-actions">Creating Tags with Set Up
Actions</h3>
<p>You can create environmental tags to shift tactical balance:</p>
<p><strong>Example 1—Creating Dim Light:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I shoot out the overhead lights with my
pistol. Set Up action to create <em>Dim Light</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Roll AGI + Ranged, DC 14.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 16 (Full Success).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The room plunges into darkness. <em>Dim
Light</em> tag applies. Everyone has Disadvantage on ranged attacks and
detailed observation. What’s next?”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “Perfect. I have <em>Night Vision</em>
proficiency—I can see fine. I move to flank the guard.”</p>
<p><strong>Example 2—Creating Hazardous Terrain:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I kick over the brazier, spilling hot coals
across the floor. Trying to create a <em>Hazardous</em> zone between us
and the enemies.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Maneuver action, DC 14 to place it
precisely.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 13 (Partial Success).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You kick it over, but it scatters
unpredictably. <em>Hazardous</em> zone created, but you’re on the
edge—take 1 resolve clock tick from the heat. Enemies are now blocked
unless they cross fire.”</p>
<h3 id="exploiting-existing-tags">Exploiting Existing Tags</h3>
<p>Use what’s already there:</p>
<p><strong>Slick Terrain:</strong> Maneuver enemies into <em>Slick</em>
areas, then Shove them. They fall prone (<em>Exposed</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Fragile Cover:</strong> If enemies hide behind <em>Fragile
Cover</em>, Strike actions degrade it. After 2-3 hits, the cover is
gone.</p>
<p><strong>Crowded Spaces:</strong> Use <em>Crowded</em> areas to blend
in (Advantage to Stealth) or lose pursuers.</p>
<p><strong>Elevated Positions:</strong> Claim high ground early. Once
there, you force enemies to climb (wasting actions) or take ranged fire
with Disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="clearing-conditions-strategically">Clearing Conditions
Strategically</h2>
<h3 id="immediate-threats-clear-now">Immediate Threats (Clear Now)</h3>
<p><strong>Bleeding:</strong> Worsens over time. Use first aid, medkits,
or ally assistance to stabilize. Don’t wait—this condition kills.</p>
<p><strong>Exposed:</strong> Disadvantage to defense means you’re next.
Use Defend/Withdraw to reach cover or break line of sight.</p>
<p><strong>Restrained:</strong> Can’t move, can’t escape. Use actions to
break free (MIG check typically) or have allies help.</p>
<p><strong>Poisoned (Fast-Acting):</strong> Some poisons deal ongoing
damage or escalate. Clear with antidote, first aid, or magical
healing.</p>
<h3 id="manageable-threats-clear-when-possible">Manageable Threats
(Clear When Possible)</h3>
<p><strong>Exhausted:</strong> Disadvantage on physical actions but
survivable. Rest or use stimulants when safe.</p>
<p><strong>Suppressed:</strong> Only lasts one action. Accept
Disadvantage or use Defend to reposition safely.</p>
<p><strong>Dazed:</strong> Clears after one turn. If you can survive the
round, condition ends naturally.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-choices-weigh-cost">Strategic Choices (Weigh
Cost)</h3>
<p><strong>Marked:</strong> Opponent gains Advantage against you. If you
can eliminate them fast, ignore <em>Marked</em>. If not, break contact
(Defend/Withdraw).</p>
<p><strong>Frightened:</strong> Disadvantage while threat visible. If
threat is weak, ignore and push through. If threat is strong, flee and
regroup.</p>
<h2 id="worked-example-tag-and-condition-interaction">Worked Example:
Tag and Condition Interaction</h2>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re fighting mercenaries in a warehouse.
The space is <em>Cramped</em> (crates and boxes everywhere) with
<em>Fragile Cover</em> (wooden crates). One mercenary has you
<em>Suppressed</em> with automatic fire.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1—You (Suppressed, in Fragile Cover):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I’m <em>Suppressed</em>—Disadvantage on my
next action. I use Defend to break line of sight and reposition behind
<em>Solid Cover</em> (a metal support pillar).”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Roll AGI, DC 14 to move through the
<em>Cramped</em> space without tripping.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 15 (Full Success).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “<em>Suppressed</em> clears. You’re now behind
<em>Solid Cover</em>. The mercenary loses line of sight.”</p>
<p><strong>Round 2—Ally (Archer, Elevated on catwalk):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ally:</strong> “I have <em>Elevated</em> and the mercenary is
in the open. I Strike with Advantage.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Roll. You have Advantage from
<em>Elevated</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Ally rolls 18 (Full Success).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Arrow hits clean. Mercenary’s resolve clock
ticks to 3/4. He’s wounded and now <em>Exposed</em> (lost his cover
position).”</p>
<p><strong>Round 3—You (behind Solid Cover):</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “He’s <em>Exposed</em> and wounded. I lean out
and Strike. Do I have Advantage from him being <em>Exposed</em>?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Yes—<em>Exposed</em> grants attackers
Advantage. Roll with Advantage.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 17 with Advantage (Full Success).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You drop him. Resolve clock fills—he’s out.
Warehouse quiet now.”</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Tags (<em>Cramped</em>, <em>Fragile
vs. Solid Cover</em>, <em>Elevated</em>) and conditions
(<em>Suppressed</em>, <em>Exposed</em>) shaped every choice. You cleared
<em>Suppressed</em> by repositioning. Ally used <em>Elevated</em> for
Advantage. You capitalized on <em>Exposed</em> to finish the fight.
Status drove tactics.</p>
<h2 id="genre-specific-tags">Genre-Specific Tags</h2>

<h1 id="ph-equipment-gear-and-inventory">Equipment, Gear, and
Inventory</h1>
<h2 id="gear-philosophy">Gear Philosophy</h2>
<p>Gear in this system represents <strong>narrative permission and
fictional positioning</strong>, not exhaustive simulation. A lockpick
set lets you attempt picking locks. Climbing gear makes scaling walls
feasible. A medkit allows first aid.</p>
<p>The GM tracks realism through fiction, not item weights or durability
trackers. If you have rope, you can use it. If you run out, the GM will
tell you.</p>
<h2 id="core-equipment-categories">Core Equipment Categories</h2>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Define your approach in combat. Blades for
close quarters, bows for range, improvised tools for desperation.
Mechanically similar; narratively distinct.</p>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Provides protection. Heavy armor might grant
Advantage to defense but impose Disadvantage on stealth. Light armor
keeps you mobile. Narratively, armor shapes how you’re perceived.</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Professional equipment that grants narrative
access. Thieves’ tools, medical kits, arcane focuses, hacking rigs.
Without the tool, you can’t attempt the action (or face
Disadvantage).</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Narrative assets like contacts, favors,
safe houses, or information. Spend them to gain Advantage, skip
challenges, or unlock options.</p>
<h2 id="inventory-management">Inventory Management</h2>
<p>This system avoids micromanagement. Use one of these approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Slots:</strong> Carry X significant items (typically 5–10).
Small items don’t count. Narratively reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative Limits:</strong> If it makes sense that you have
it, you do. If the GM questions it, justify or accept you don’t have
it.</p>
<p><strong>GM Discretion:</strong> The GM tracks what’s plausible. If
you’re fleeing through sewers, you probably don’t have your full
kit.</p>
<p>Choose the method that fits your table’s preferences.</p>
<h2 id="when-gear-matters">When Gear Matters</h2>
<p>Gear creates <strong>Advantage</strong> or <strong>narrative
access</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Climbing gear grants Advantage on scaling cliffs.</li>
<li>A disguise kit enables infiltration attempts.</li>
<li>A medkit lets you stabilize <em>Bleeding</em> conditions.</li>
<li>A contact in the docks gives you access to smugglers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gear matters when it changes what’s possible or shifts your odds. The
GM calls for specific gear when fiction demands it.</p>
<h2 id="worked-example">Worked Example</h2>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> Marcus (the burned intelligence analyst
from Chapter 16) needs to infiltrate a corporate server room to retrieve
encrypted files.</p>
<p><strong>Gear Check:</strong> Marcus has his laptop (encrypted), fake
IDs, and burner phones. The GM asks: “Do you have anything that helps
with physical security?”</p>
<p>Marcus’s player: “I have lockpick tools in my kit—picked them up
after the safe house job.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Good. The server room door has a standard lock.
With your <em>Urban Investigation</em> skill and lockpicks, you have
Advantage. Roll RSN + skill.”</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Gear (lockpicks) granted narrative access
(attempting the lock) and mechanical advantage (Advantage on the roll).
Without the tools, Marcus would face Disadvantage or couldn’t attempt it
at all.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative Limit Example:</strong> Later, the GM asks if
Marcus has a grappling hook to scale the building. Marcus’s player: “I
don’t think I’d have that—I’ve been traveling light since fleeing the
city.” The GM agrees. Fiction determines plausibility.</p>
<h2 id="genre-specific-gear-examples">Genre-Specific Gear Examples</h2>
<h3 id="fantasy-gear">Fantasy Gear</h3>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Longsword, shortbow, staff, daggers.
Mechanically similar; fiction determines reach and style.</p>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Chainmail (heavy, protective, loud), leather
(light, mobile, quiet), robes (no protection, unhindered casting).</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Thieves’ tools (lockpicking, trap disarm),
healer’s kit (stabilize wounds), arcane focus (spellcasting), climbing
gear (ropes, pitons).</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Guild membership (access to fences, safe
houses), noble favor (legal immunity, access to courts), contacts in
underworld.</p>
<p><strong>Example Loadout—Rogue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Paired daggers, hand crossbow</li>
<li><strong>Armor:</strong> Leather armor (Advantage to stealth, light
protection)</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Thieves’ tools, grappling hook, smoke
bombs</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> Contact in Thieves’ Guild (can fence
stolen goods)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="modernurban-gear">Modern/Urban Gear</h3>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Pistol (concealable), shotgun (close
quarters), rifle (range), knife (backup).</p>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Kevlar vest (stops bullets, bulky), casual
clothes (no protection, blends in).</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Lockpick set, laptop (hacking), smartphone
(research, communication), first aid kit, disguise kit.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Police contact (access to records),
journalist ally (publicize info), safe house (temporary hideout).</p>
<p><strong>Example Loadout—Private Investigator:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Concealed pistol, collapsible baton</li>
<li><strong>Armor:</strong> Kevlar vest (worn under coat)</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Lockpicks, camera, audio recorder,
laptop</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> Contact in city police (Detective
Reyes), access to criminal databases</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scifi-gear">Sci-Fi Gear</h3>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Plasma rifle (energy weapon, recharge
needed), slug thrower (kinetic, breaches hulls), stun baton
(nonlethal).</p>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Enviro-suit (life support, sealed), combat
armor (heavy, powered), shipboard clothes (no protection, mobility).</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Neural interface (hacking, data access),
portable lab (analysis), medkit (trauma stabilization), grav-boots
(zero-G movement).</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Ship access (transportation, refuge),
black-market contact (restricted tech), corporate ID (facility
access).</p>
<p><strong>Example Loadout—Xenobiologist:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Stun baton, compact slug thrower</li>
<li><strong>Armor:</strong> Enviro-suit with biohazard seals</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Portable lab, neural interface, sample
containers</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> Access to fringe colony network,
black-market bio-samples</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gear-upgrades-and-advancement">Gear Upgrades and
Advancement</h2>
<p>As campaigns progress, gear improves:</p>
<h3 id="tier-1-starting-basic-gear">Tier 1 (Starting)—Basic Gear</h3>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Narrative permission. You have what you
need to attempt actions.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Standard weapons, basic tools, mundane
armor, a few contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effect:</strong> Advantage when gear applies. No
special bonuses.</p>
<h3 id="tier-2-mid-campaign-specialized-gear">Tier 2
(Mid-Campaign)—Specialized Gear</h3>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Enhanced capabilities. Gear grants
additional benefits or covers edge cases.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Masterwork weapons (+1 to strikes),
advanced tools (hacking rig with AI assist), reinforced armor (grants
<em>Solid Cover</em> when stationary), influential contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effect:</strong> Advantage plus occasional
narrative bonus (bypass minor obstacles, reduce complications).</p>
<p><strong>How to Acquire:</strong> Loot, downtime crafting (see Chapter
10), faction rewards, purchase with significant resources.</p>
<h3 id="tier-3-late-campaign-legendary-gear">Tier 3 (Late
Campaign)—Legendary Gear</h3>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Game-changing capabilities. Gear opens new
tactical options or solves problems outright.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Enchanted blade (ignores armor), cloaking
device (invisible in darkness), AI-guided weapon (auto-target),
high-level political ally (mobilize resources).</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effect:</strong> Advantage, narrative bonuses, and
occasional automatic success on appropriate checks.</p>
<p><strong>How to Acquire:</strong> Campaign rewards, major quest
completion, legendary crafting projects, powerful faction
membership.</p>
<h2 id="resource-spending-and-leverage">Resource Spending and
Leverage</h2>
<p>Resources are narrative advantages you spend for effect:</p>
<h3 id="contacts-and-favors">Contacts and Favors</h3>
<p><strong>What They Do:</strong> Contacts provide information, access,
or assistance.</p>
<p><strong>When to Spend:</strong> When stuck on investigation, need
entry to restricted areas, or require backup.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I call Detective Reyes—he owes me a favor from
the docks case. Can he get me into the precinct evidence locker?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Yes, but this burns the favor. He’ll let you in
after hours, but you’re on your own if caught.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “Worth it. I need that file.”</p>
<h3 id="safe-houses-and-refuges">Safe Houses and Refuges</h3>
<p><strong>What They Do:</strong> Temporary havens where you can rest,
plan, or hide from pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong> When heat is on, you need downtime, or
you need secure location for planning.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Corporate security is sweeping the district.
Pressure clock ticks to 3/4.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I head to the safe house—the old warehouse on
Pier 7. We lie low until the sweep passes.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Safe. You can rest here. Clear
<em>Exhausted</em> condition and plan next move.”</p>
<h3 id="information-and-secrets">Information and Secrets</h3>
<p><strong>What They Do:</strong> Leverage for negotiation, blackmail,
or bypassing obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>When to Spend:</strong> When negotiating from weak position,
need to force cooperation, or bypass gatekeepers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The crime boss laughs. ‘Why would I tell you
anything?’”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I slide a datastick across the table. ‘Because
I have evidence of your deal with the feds. Cooperate, and this
disappears.’”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Roll Persuasion with Advantage—you have serious
leverage.”</p>
<h2 id="narrative-inventory-troubleshooting">Narrative Inventory
Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="common-questions">Common Questions</h3>
<p><strong>“Can I have X?”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If it fits your concept and backstory:</strong> Probably
yes.</li>
<li><strong>If it’s expensive or rare:</strong> Requires justification
(downtime purchase, loot, favor).</li>
<li><strong>If it’s implausible:</strong> No. Explain why it doesn’t
fit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“Do I run out of ammo/supplies?”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal usage:</strong> No tracking. Assume you restock
during downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Extended missions without resupply:</strong> GM might call
for resource checks or introduce scarcity as pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative scarcity:</strong> If fleeing through wilderness
or trapped, the GM might say “You’re low on supplies—what do you
prioritize?”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“Can I upgrade my gear?”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Downtime crafting:</strong> Use Chapter 10 downtime rules to
craft or upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Loot:</strong> Acquire better gear from defeated enemies or
discovered caches.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase:</strong> Spend resources (money, favors) during
downtime to buy upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“I want gear that gives me a bonus.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative permission:</strong> Gear grants narrative access
(lockpicks let you pick locks) and Advantage when relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical bonuses:</strong> Mid-to-late campaign gear might
grant +1 or special abilities. Talk to your GM about progression.</li>

<h1 id="ph-downtime-recovery">Downtime &amp; Recovery</h1>
<h2 id="downtime-overview">Downtime Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Downtime</strong> represents time between adventures: days,
weeks, or months when you’re not in immediate danger. Use it to recover,
train, pursue projects, and build connections.</p>
<p>Downtime bridges story arcs, gives your character space to grow, and
creates opportunities for personal goals beyond the main plot.</p>
<h2 id="recovery--rest">Recovery &amp; Rest</h2>
<p><strong>Healing:</strong> Extended rest clears most injuries and
conditions. The GM determines how much time you need based on
severity.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing Conditions:</strong> Rest removes
<em>Exhausted</em>, <em>Bleeding</em>, and similar conditions. Severe
conditions (<em>Poisoned</em>, <em>Cursed</em>) may require medical aid
or specialized treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Restoring Resources:</strong> Replenish gear, contacts, and
narrative resources. Re-stock supplies, repair equipment, and rebuild
spent favors.</p>
<p>Rest is the default recovery method. Specific conditions may require
more.</p>
<h2 id="downtime-activities">Downtime Activities</h2>
<p>Downtime activities let you invest time in goals beyond immediate
adventures. Each activity requires time (days to weeks), may involve
checks, and produces tangible results.</p>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Learn new skills, improve
proficiencies, or expand your capabilities through practice or
instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 1-4 weeks depending on complexity</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong> - <strong>Skill
Training</strong>: Work toward gaining a new skill from an adjacent
package (requires GM approval and narrative justification) -
<strong>Proficiency Refinement</strong>: Deepen expertise in an existing
proficiency, potentially unlocking new narrative permissions -
<strong>Attribute Conditioning</strong>: Rare; intensive training might
contribute to attribute improvement at major milestones</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Describe what you’re training in and
why. The GM sets a progress clock (typically 4-6 segments). Each week of
training, roll relevant attribute + training focus (RSN for studying,
MIG for physical conditioning, etc.) vs. DC 13. Full Success ticks 2
segments, Partial ticks 1. Fill the clock to complete training.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I want to train with the retired duelist,
Master Valen, to learn Blades.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Valen agrees to teach you. Progress clock
‘Learn Blades’ (0/6). You have 4 weeks before the next adventure. Roll
RSN or AGI each week, DC 13.”</p>
<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Roll 15 (Full Success) → Progress 2/6
<strong>Week 2:</strong> Roll 12 (Partial Success) → Progress 3/6
<strong>Week 3:</strong> Roll 16 (Full Success) → Progress 5/6
<strong>Week 4:</strong> Roll 14 (Full Success) → Progress 7/6
(Complete!)</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You’ve mastered the basics. Add Blades skill.
Valen invites you to spar with his advanced students—potential future
connection.”</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Investigate mysteries, study ancient
texts, gather intelligence, or learn specialized knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> Days to weeks depending on
obscurity</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong> - <strong>Knowledge
Gain</strong>: Learn crucial information (villain’s weakness, ritual
requirements, historical context) - <strong>Advantages</strong>: Gain
narrative Advantage on future related checks (“I researched this cult’s
symbols”) - <strong>Story Hooks</strong>: Uncover leads, plot threads,
or complications</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> State your research goal and method
(library, interview experts, fieldwork). GM sets a progress clock based
on how obscure the information is. Each research session, roll RSN +
Research vs. DC (12-18). Full Success ticks progress and may reveal
bonus info. Partial Success ticks progress but introduces complications
(wrong lead, unwanted attention). Fail might waste time or alert
interested parties.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I research the Crimson Hand cult in the city
archives. What’s their origin and current activity?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Progress clock ‘Crimson Hand Research’ (0/4).
DC 15. Partial means you find info but someone notices your
interest.”</p>
<p><strong>Session 1:</strong> Roll 18 (Full Success) → Progress 2/4.
“You find records of their founding—50 years ago, a rogue mage. They’re
active in the docks.”</p>
<p><strong>Session 2:</strong> Roll 13 (Partial Success) → Progress 3/4.
“You find recent activity reports, but a librarian sees what you’re
reading and looks concerned. They slip you a note: ‘They’re
watching.’”</p>
<p><strong>Session 3:</strong> Roll 16 (Full Success) → Progress 5/4
(Complete!). “You compile a dossier: Their current leader is ‘The Veiled
One,’ they operate from a warehouse, and they’re smuggling arcane
components. You gain Advantage on future checks to infiltrate or
confront them.”</p>
<h3 id="crafting">Crafting</h3>
<p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Create gear, modify equipment, brew
potions, or forge tools.</p>
<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> Days to weeks depending on item
complexity</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong> - <strong>Useful Gear</strong>:
Create items with narrative permissions (lockpicks, climbing gear,
poisons) - <strong>Custom Equipment</strong>: Modify existing gear
(reinforce armor, add weapon feature) - <strong>Consumables</strong>:
Brew potions, craft ammunition, prepare explosives</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Describe what you want to create. GM
sets a progress clock and resource cost (materials, workshop access).
Roll Technical + relevant skill (Engineering, Medicine for potions,
etc.) vs. DC (12-18). Full Success ticks progress efficiently. Partial
Success ticks progress but wastes materials or takes longer. Fail might
ruin materials or create a flawed product.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I want to craft a grappling hook launcher—lets
me scale buildings quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Progress clock ‘Grappling Launcher’ (0/4).
Costs 50 gold in materials. DC 14 Technical. Partial means you burn
materials (additional 20 gold).”</p>
<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Roll 16 (Full Success) → Progress 2/4. “The
trigger mechanism works perfectly.”</p>
<p><strong>Week 2:</strong> Roll 12 (Partial Success) → Progress 3/4.
“The spring isn’t right—you buy a stronger one (+20 gold).”</p>
<p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Roll 17 (Full Success) → Progress 5/4
(Complete!). “It’s done. Grappling launcher: Grants Advantage on
climbing checks, can reach 30 feet.”</p>
<h3 id="social-networking">Social Networking</h3>
<p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Build contacts, cultivate alliances,
or gain influence with factions.</p>
<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 1-3 weeks per contact/faction</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong> - <strong>Contacts</strong>:
NPCs who provide information, favors, or access - <strong>Faction
Standing</strong>: Improve reputation with a group (guards, merchants,
nobles) - <strong>Story Hooks</strong>: Connections create opportunities
and complications</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Describe who you’re networking with
and your approach (gifts, favors, shared interests). GM sets a progress
clock (typically 4-6 segments). Roll Presence + Persuasion vs. DC
(12-16). Full Success builds rapport quickly. Partial Success builds
rapport but you owe a favor or reveal something. Fail might offend or
waste their time.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I want to build a contact in the city
watch—someone who can warn me about investigations.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Progress clock ‘City Watch Contact’ (0/4). You
meet Sergeant Kade at a tavern. DC 13 Presence.”</p>
<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Roll 15 (Full Success) → Progress 2/4. “Kade
appreciates your stories. You bond over shared dislike of
corruption.”</p>
<p><strong>Week 2:</strong> Roll 11 (Partial Success) → Progress 3/4.
“Kade warms to you but asks: ‘If I tip you off, what’s in it for me?’
You owe a favor.”</p>
<p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Roll 16 (Full Success) → Progress 5/4
(Complete!). “Kade agrees to warn you about investigations if you help
bust a smuggling ring. Contact established.”</p>
<h3 id="personal-projects">Personal Projects</h3>
<p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Pursue character-specific goals tied
to backstory, beliefs, or ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> Varies widely (weeks to months)</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong> - <strong>Narrative
Closure</strong>: Resolve character arcs or backstory threads -
<strong>New Resources</strong>: Establish safe houses, businesses, or
strongholds - <strong>Character Growth</strong>: Evolve motivations,
relationships, or goals</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Propose your project. GM frames scope
and sets a long-term progress clock (6-10 segments). Progress happens
through downtime activities, side quests, or story events. Projects
create narrative depth more than mechanical advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I want to establish a safe house network for
refugees fleeing the war.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Progress clock ‘Refugee Network’ (0/8). You’ll
need safe locations, trustworthy contacts, and funding. We’ll track
progress as you complete related activities.”</p>
<p><strong>Downtime 1:</strong> You donate 200 gold and recruit a
sympathetic merchant. Progress 2/8.</p>
<p><strong>Downtime 2:</strong> Side quest—you rescue refugees from
bandits. Progress 4/8.</p>
<p><strong>Downtime 3:</strong> You negotiate with a noble for a
property. Roll Persuasion, DC 15. Success → Progress 6/8.</p>
<p><strong>Downtime 4:</strong> You formalize the network with local
clergy. Progress 8/8 (Complete!). Network established: You can shelter
allies, gather info from refugees, and have a meaningful legacy.</p>
<h3 id="side-quests">Side Quests</h3>
<p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Take on smaller missions during
downtime—bounties, delivery jobs, investigation requests.</p>
<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> Days to 1 week</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong> - <strong>Income</strong>: Earn
gold (typically 50-200 depending on danger) -
<strong>Reputation</strong>: Build standing with factions or contacts -
<strong>Story Leads</strong>: Uncover hooks for future adventures</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> The GM presents opportunities or you
propose ideas. Side quests are mini-adventures—typically 1-2 scenes with
a conflict and resolution. Roll relevant skills as needed. Success earns
rewards, failure brings complications but no catastrophic
consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I take a bounty: track down a pickpocket who
stole from the merchant guild.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “100 gold reward. Scene 1: Track them
(Perception, DC 14). Scene 2: Apprehend them (Combat or Persuasion, DC
15).”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1:</strong> Roll 16 (Full Success). “You track them to
the docks. They’re selling stolen goods.”</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2:</strong> Roll Persuasion 14 (Partial Success). “You
convince them to return the goods, but they flee before you can bring
them in. Merchant guild pays 75 gold (partial reward) and asks you to
watch for them.”</p>
<p>Side quests are lower stakes but still engaging. They fill time
productively and keep your character active between major story
arcs.</p>
<h2 id="npc-relationships-faction-standing">NPC Relationships &amp;
Faction Standing</h2>
<p>Building relationships with NPCs and factions creates narrative
depth, mechanical advantages, and story hooks. Relationships aren’t just
flavor—they provide access, information, and support when you need
them.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-mechanics">Relationship Mechanics</h3>
<p><strong>Relationship Levels:</strong> - <strong>Stranger</strong>
(0): No connection, neutral stance - <strong>Acquaintance</strong> (1):
Recognize each other, willing to talk - <strong>Friend</strong> (2):
Trust and support, small favors - <strong>Ally</strong> (3): Significant
trust, major favors, risk themselves - <strong>Sworn</strong> (4):
Ride-or-die, sacrifice for you</p>
<p><strong>Building Relationships:</strong> Progress through levels via
social interactions, favors, shared experiences, and downtime
activities. GM tracks relationship progress using clocks (typically 4
segments per level). Positive interactions tick progress; betrayals or
conflicts tick a “Deterioration” clock.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship Benefits by Level:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acquaintance:</strong> - Provide basic information (“I heard
rumors about…”) - Small discounts or preferential treatment - Warn you
about obvious dangers</p>
<p><strong>Friend:</strong> - Share valuable information (“Here’s what I
know about the cult”) - Loan resources (gold, gear, access to locations)
- Introduce you to their contacts</p>
<p><strong>Ally:</strong> - Take risks for you (lie to authorities,
provide alibis) - Offer significant resources (safe house, armed backup)
- Go out of their way to help</p>
<p><strong>Sworn:</strong> - Sacrifice for you (take a hit, abandon
their safety) - Share deeply personal or dangerous secrets - Stand by
you even when it costs them everything</p>
<h3 id="relationship-example">Relationship Example: Building an
Ally</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You want Sergeant Kade (City Watch) to become
an ally, not just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Current Level:</strong> Friend (2). Kade warns you about
investigations and shares info.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Reach Ally (3). Kade will actively help you,
even bending rules.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> Complete a major favor—help Kade bust a
smuggling ring he’s been tracking.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Progress clock ‘Kade Becomes Ally’ (0/4). You
need to prove you’re worth risking his career for.”</p>
<p><strong>Downtime Actions:</strong> - <strong>Week 1:</strong> You
research the smugglers (Research check, DC 15). Success → Progress 1/4.
- <strong>Week 2:</strong> You stake out the warehouse (Perception
check, DC 14). Success → Progress 2/4. - <strong>Week 3:</strong> You
infiltrate and gather evidence (Stealth check, DC 16). Success →
Progress 4/4 (Complete!).</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> You hand Kade the evidence. He makes the
bust, gets promoted, and tells you: “I owe you. Anything you need—within
reason—I’ve got your back.” <strong>Kade is now an Ally (Level
3).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Kade can now provide search warrants,
delay investigations, or mobilize guards for backup. He won’t break the
law outright, but he’ll stretch it for you.</p>
<h3 id="faction-standing">Faction Standing</h3>
<p><strong>Factions</strong> are groups with shared goals—guilds, noble
houses, criminal syndicates, religious orders. Your standing with them
affects access, prices, and story opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Levels:</strong> - <strong>Hostile</strong> (-2):
Attacked on sight, bounties on your head - <strong>Unfriendly</strong>
(-1): Refused service, high prices, suspicion - <strong>Neutral</strong>
(0): Default state, transactional interactions -
<strong>Friendly</strong> (+1): Discounts, favors, introductions -
<strong>Honored</strong> (+2): Major support, access to inner circles,
defended by faction</p>
<p><strong>Changing Standing:</strong> Complete jobs for the faction,
donate resources, or advance their goals. Each significant action moves
standing by 1 step (Neutral → Friendly, for example). Betrayals or
opposition move standing down.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Faction:</strong> The Merchant Guild</p>
<p><strong>Current Standing:</strong> Neutral (0). They’ll trade with
you at market prices.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> You recover stolen guild shipments worth 500
gold.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The guild master thanks you publicly. Standing
shifts to Friendly (+1).”</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> 10% discount on guild goods, introductions
to wealthy merchants, invitations to guild events (social networking
opportunities).</p>
<h3 id="managing-multiple-relationships">Managing Multiple
Relationships</h3>
<p><strong>Conflicting Loyalties:</strong> When two contacts or factions
oppose each other, you may need to choose sides or navigate carefully.
Betraying one to help another damages the betrayed relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Relationships require occasional
interaction to maintain. If you ignore a friend for months, the GM may
tick a “Neglect” clock. Fill it, and the relationship downgrades (Friend
→ Acquaintance).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I haven’t talked to Marcus (my researcher
friend) in three months. Is he still helping me?”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Marcus feels ignored. Neglect clock (0/4) is at
3/4. If you don’t reconnect soon, he’ll downgrade to Acquaintance.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I visit him and apologize, bringing his
favorite wine.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He’s hurt but forgives you. Neglect clock
resets. Maintain contact or this happens again.”</p>
<h2 id="long-term-projects-campaign-integration">Long-Term Projects
&amp; Campaign Integration</h2>
<p>Long-term projects span multiple downtime periods and integrate with
the campaign’s story. They give you agency to shape the world beyond
reacting to the GM’s plot.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-project-framework">Long-Term Project Framework</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Define Goal</strong> What do you want to create,
achieve, or change? Be specific.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Establish a spy network in the capital -
Build a stronghold in the wilderness - Write and publish a revolutionary
manifesto - Reconcile two warring factions</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Progress Clock</strong> GM determines scope: 6-10
segments for major projects, 10-20 for epic ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Identify Milestones</strong> Break the project into
phases. Each milestone represents a significant step.</p>
<p><strong>Example (Spy Network):</strong> - <strong>Milestone
1</strong> (0-3 segments): Recruit initial agents - <strong>Milestone
2</strong> (4-6 segments): Establish safe houses and communication -
<strong>Milestone 3</strong> (7-10 segments): Infiltrate key
institutions</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Progress Through Play</strong> Progress happens via
downtime activities, side quests, or main story events that align with
your project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Handle Setbacks</strong> Failures or complications
may introduce a “Setback” clock. Fill it, and you lose progress or face
a crisis.</p>
<h3 id="stronghold-example">Long-Term Project Example: Building a
Stronghold</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish a defensible base in the Wildlands
where you and your allies can operate safely.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Clock:</strong> “Wildlands Stronghold” (0/12)</p>
<p><strong>Milestones:</strong> - <strong>Phase 1</strong> (0-4): Secure
land and clear immediate threats - <strong>Phase 2</strong> (5-8):
Construct basic fortifications - <strong>Phase 3</strong> (9-12):
Establish supply lines and defenses</p>
<p><strong>Downtime 1:</strong> You negotiate with the local warlord for
land rights. Roll Persuasion, DC 16. Success → Progress 2/12.</p>
<p><strong>Downtime 2:</strong> You hire workers and begin construction.
Cost: 500 gold. Progress 4/12 (Milestone 1 complete).</p>
<p><strong>Campaign Event:</strong> During an adventure, bandits attack
your construction site. You defend it. GM: “You’ve proven the site can
be held. Progress 6/12.”</p>
<p><strong>Downtime 3:</strong> You establish a supply route with a
friendly merchant. Roll Social Networking, DC 14. Success → Progress
8/12 (Milestone 2 complete).</p>
<p><strong>Downtime 4:</strong> You fortify the walls and train guards.
Cost: 300 gold. Progress 10/12.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign Event:</strong> A rival faction attacks your
stronghold. You repel them, proving its strategic value. Progress 12/12
(Complete!).</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Your stronghold is operational. Benefits: -
Safe haven for downtime activities - Base of operations for regional
adventures - Source of story hooks (defending it, expanding
influence)</p>
<h3 id="campaign-integration-tips">Campaign Integration Tips</h3>
<p><strong>Coordinate with GM:</strong> Discuss how your project fits
the campaign. The GM might tie it to main story events or use it to
create new plot threads.</p>
<p><strong>Accept Complications:</strong> Projects rarely go smoothly.
Rivals, resource shortages, and unexpected alliances make them
interesting. Embrace setbacks as story opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Share Spotlight:</strong> If other players pursue projects,
support them. Collaborative projects (shared stronghold, joint business)
create party cohesion and shared stakes.</p>
<p><strong>Use Projects for Downtime:</strong> Long-term projects give
downtime purpose. Instead of “I rest for two weeks,” you say “I advance
my spy network while the party recovers.”</p>
<h2 id="working-with-your-gm">Working with Your GM</h2>
<p><strong>Propose your goals.</strong> Tell the GM what you want to
accomplish and why it matters to your character.</p>
<p><strong>Negotiate scope.</strong> The GM will frame what’s feasible
in the time available and what costs or risks are involved.</p>
<p><strong>Roll when stakes matter.</strong> Simple downtime actions
(rest, routine training) don’t require rolls. Complex projects (rare
research, dangerous networking) may require checks.</p>
<p>Downtime is collaborative. Work with your GM to create meaningful
opportunities.</p>

<h1 id="ph-roleplaying-guidance">Roleplaying Guidance</h1>
<h2 id="roleplaying-fundamentals">Roleplaying Fundamentals</h2>
<p><strong>Roleplaying</strong> means inhabiting your character and
making choices through their perspective. You’re not playing to win;
you’re playing to create compelling stories.</p>
<p>Speak as your character. React to the world. Make decisions based on
who they are, not just tactical advantage.</p>
<h2 id="creating-memorable-characters">Creating Memorable
Characters</h2>
<p><strong>Distinct Voice:</strong> Give your character a recognizable
way of speaking or acting. Terse and direct. Verbose and academic.
Cautious and skeptical. Voice makes them memorable.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Motivations:</strong> What drives your character?
Revenge, justice, curiosity, survival, wealth, redemption. Motivations
guide choices and create drama when they conflict with others’
goals.</p>
<p><strong>Flaws and Strengths:</strong> Perfect characters are boring.
Give yours flaws— arrogance, distrust, recklessness, stubbornness. Flaws
create complications. Strengths show what they excel at. Both make them
human.</p>
<p>Examples: A cynical investigator who doesn’t trust authority. A brave
knight who’s too proud to ask for help. A scholar who freezes under
pressure but excels with preparation.</p>
<h2 id="engaging-with-fiction">Engaging with Fiction</h2>
<p><strong>Describe Actions Vividly:</strong> Don’t just say “I attack.”
Say “I lunge low, aiming for the guard’s knee.” Vivid descriptions make
scenes come alive.</p>
<p><strong>React to Outcomes:</strong> When the GM describes a result,
respond. If you fail to pick the lock, show frustration or improvise a
new plan. If you succeed but alert the guard, react to the
complication.</p>
<p><strong>Build on Details:</strong> When the GM or another player adds
a detail, incorporate it. “The tavern smells like smoke”—“I cough and
pull my cloak over my face.”</p>
<h2 id="making-meaningful-choices">Making Meaningful Choices</h2>
<p><strong>Choose What Your Character Would Do:</strong> Sometimes the
optimal tactical choice isn’t what your character would do. If they’re
protective, they’ll risk themselves for allies. If they’re vengeful,
they’ll pursue revenge over safety.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace Consequences:</strong> Partial Success and Failure
drive stories. Don’t avoid risk to prevent complications. Complications
create drama and opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Trust Your Group:</strong> Make choices that create space for
others. Share spotlight. Support their arcs. Collaborative storytelling
means everyone shines.</p>
<h2 id="scene-specific-roleplaying">Scene-Specific Roleplaying</h2>
<h3 id="combat-scenes">Combat Scenes</h3>
<p><strong>Describe Actions with Character Flair:</strong> Your fighter
charges headlong, roaring a battle cry. Your rogue circles cautiously,
looking for openings. Your tactician barks orders while covering allies.
Combat is character expression.</p>
<p><strong>React to Wounds and Setbacks:</strong> When your resolve
clock ticks, show it. Grimace, stagger, show desperation or fury. When
an ally falls, react—rage, fear, determination.</p>
<p><strong>Use Tactical Choices to Show Character:</strong> Protecting
the wounded shows loyalty. Pursuing a fleeing enemy shows determination
or vengeance. Holding ground while others retreat shows courage or
stubbornness. Mechanics reveal character.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You (as Elara):</strong> “The bandit lunges at the scholar. I
can’t let that happen— I dive between them, blades up, and shout ‘You’ll
have to go through me first!’”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He takes the bait, turning on you. Roll to
Defend—DC 16.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 14 (Partial Success).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You block his strike, but the force drives you
back. You’re now <em>Exposed</em>— Disadvantage on defense next round.
But the scholar is safe and fleeing.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “Worth it. I grit my teeth and ready for his
next strike.”</p>
<h3 id="social-scenes">Social Scenes</h3>
<p><strong>Speak in Character Voice:</strong> Use phrases or speech
patterns that fit your character. A street urchin talks differently than
a noble. Consistent voice makes your character recognizable.</p>
<p><strong>Show Don’t Tell Emotions:</strong> Instead of “I’m angry,”
describe clenched fists or a cold stare. Instead of “I’m scared,”
describe shallow breathing or avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p><strong>React to NPC Body Language:</strong> When the GM describes an
NPC’s hesitation or defensive posture, respond. “I notice he’s avoiding
my eyes. I soften my tone and say, ‘You’re not in trouble. I just need
to know what you saw.’”</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The merchant leans back, arms crossed. ‘I don’t
know anything about that shipment.’”</p>
<p><strong>You (as Marcus):</strong> “I notice the way he glances at the
back room. I pull out a datastick and slide it across the table. ‘This
has evidence that clears you of involvement. But I need names—who paid
you to look the other way?’”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Roll Persuasion, DC 16.”</p>
<p><strong>You roll 17 (Full Success).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “He hesitates, then nods slowly. ‘Varren
Corp. They said it was routine cargo. I didn’t ask questions.’ He’s
cooperating now.”</p>
<h3 id="exploration--investigation-scenes">Exploration &amp;
Investigation Scenes</h3>
<p><strong>Describe Your Approach:</strong> Are you cautious or bold?
Methodical or intuitive? “I check each crate carefully, listening for
movement” versus “I stride in and call out ‘Show yourself!’”</p>
<p><strong>React to Clues and Danger:</strong> When you find blood on
the floor, show concern or determination. When a trap almost triggers,
show relief or heightened caution.</p>
<p><strong>Build Theories Aloud:</strong> Share your character’s
reasoning. “This doesn’t make sense—why leave the door unlocked unless
they wanted us to enter?” Speculation creates engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “You find a hidden compartment in the desk.
Inside is a letter—coded, but you recognize the seal.”</p>
<p><strong>You (as Kaida):</strong> “My hands shake. That’s an OmniCorp
executive seal—this goes higher than I thought. I photograph it with my
neural interface and pocket the original. We need to move—if they’re
watching, they know we’re close.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “As you turn to leave, you hear footsteps in the
hall. Pressure clock ticks to 3/4.”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “Damn. I motion to the crew—‘Back exit, now.’
We move fast and quiet.”</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-character-consistency">Maintaining Character
Consistency</h2>
<p><strong>Track Your Character’s Growth:</strong> Characters change
through play. The cynical investigator who starts trusting allies. The
reckless fighter who learns caution. Let your character evolve, but
track why they change.</p>
<p><strong>Revisit Motivations:</strong> Check in with your character’s
goals. Are they still pursuing revenge? Have they found redemption?
Motivations shift—acknowledge it in play.</p>
<p><strong>Use Flaws Consistently:</strong> If your character is proud,
they don’t suddenly ask for help without cause. If they’re loyal, they
don’t abandon allies. Flaws create predictability and dramatic tension
when tested.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid Whiplash Shifts:</strong> Gradual change feels earned.
Sudden shifts (“I’m suddenly ruthless after being kind for six
sessions”) break immersion. Let pivotal moments justify changes.</p>
<h2 id="handling-roleplaying-challenges">Handling Roleplaying
Challenges</h2>
<h3 id="when-youre-stuck-for-character-voice">When You’re Stuck for
Character Voice</h3>
<p><strong>Pick One Trait and Lean In:</strong> Focus on a single
defining trait—cynical, hopeful, cautious, bold. Let that guide your
responses until you find more nuance.</p>
<p><strong>Borrow from Fiction:</strong> Think of a character from media
who fits your concept. What would they say? Adapt it to your
character.</p>
<p><strong>Summarize Third-Person:</strong> “My character would be
suspicious here, so she hangs back and watches.” Narration is valid
roleplaying.</p>
<h3 id="when-drama-conflicts-with-tactics">When Drama Conflicts with
Tactics</h3>
<p><strong>Choose Drama if the Stakes Feel Right:</strong> If failing
dramatically creates better story than succeeding tactically, go for it.
Trust your group to support the choice.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss Meta When Needed:</strong> “My character would chase
them, but that splits the party—should we talk this through?”
Collaborating beats rigid adherence.</p>
<h3 id="when-spotlight-feels-unbalanced">When Spotlight Feels
Unbalanced</h3>
<p><strong>Create Openings for Others:</strong> “I’m stumped—does anyone
else have ideas?” or “I can’t do this alone—who’s with me?”</p>
<p><strong>Step Back When Appropriate:</strong> If you’ve been center
stage, let others lead. Support their scenes with reactions and
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Check In Out-of-Character:</strong> “I feel like I’ve been
talking a lot—does anyone want to jump in?”</p>

<h1 id="ph-alternative-play-modes">Alternative Play Modes</h1>
<p>The standard table configuration—one GM and 3-5 players, meeting in
person—is just one way to play. This chapter covers alternative
configurations: solo play (no GM), duet play (1 GM + 1 player), GM-less
play (rotating authority), and online play (virtual tabletops). Each
mode requires adapting the system’s tools, but the core mechanics remain
consistent.</p>
<h2 id="solo-play">Solo Play</h2>
<p>Playing without a GM is possible using oracle mechanics, random
tables, and structured decision frameworks. Solo play requires you to
wear both hats—player and GM—which changes how you approach challenges,
pacing, and narrative structure.</p>
<h3 id="oracle-mechanics">Oracle Mechanics</h3>
<p><strong>Oracles</strong> answer yes/no questions when you need the
world to respond to your actions. Instead of a GM ruling, you roll to
determine outcomes or facts.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Oracle (d6):</strong></p>
<p>Roll 1d6 when you ask a yes/no question:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6:</strong> Yes, and… (extra benefit)</li>
<li><strong>4-5:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>3:</strong> Yes, but… (complication)</li>
<li><strong>2:</strong> No, but… (silver lining)</li>
<li><strong>1:</strong> No, and… (additional problem)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Is the guard asleep?” Roll oracle.</li>
<li>“Do I know someone in this city?” Roll oracle.</li>
<li>“Is the door unlocked?” Roll oracle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oracles <strong>don’t replace skill checks</strong>. Use them for
environmental questions, NPC behavior, or world state. Use skill checks
for your character’s actions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I approach the merchant’s shop. Is it open
this late?”</p>
<p><strong>Oracle Roll:</strong> 2 (No, but…)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The shop is closed, but you notice a
light on in the back room—someone’s still there. You could knock.</p>
<h3 id="weighted-questions">Advanced Oracle: Weighted Questions</h3>
<p>For questions with likelihood, adjust the oracle:</p>
<p><strong>Likely (roll with Advantage):</strong> “Is the nobleman at
the gala?” (He’s a regular—Advantage makes ‘Yes’ more probable)</p>
<p><strong>Unlikely (roll with Disadvantage):</strong> “Is there a
hidden escape tunnel?” (Rare—Disadvantage makes ‘No’ more probable)</p>
<p><strong>Certain:</strong> Skip the roll. If it’s obvious (“Is the sun
up at noon?”), don’t roll.</p>
<h3 id="npc-behavior-tables">NPC Behavior Tables</h3>
<p>When you encounter an NPC, roll to determine their disposition and
goals. This prevents you from creating only helpful or hostile NPCs.</p>
<p><strong>NPC Disposition (d6):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1:</strong> Hostile (attacks, refuses, sabotages)</li>
<li><strong>2:</strong> Unfriendly (suspicious, demands payment,
unhelpful)</li>
<li><strong>3:</strong> Cautious (neutral, needs convincing)</li>
<li><strong>4:</strong> Neutral (willing to talk, no strong
opinion)</li>
<li><strong>5:</strong> Friendly (helpful, offers info or aid)</li>
<li><strong>6:</strong> Enthusiastic (eager to help, volunteers
extra)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NPC Goals (d6):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1:</strong> Profit (wants money, trade, or valuable
info)</li>
<li><strong>2:</strong> Safety (avoids danger, seeks protection)</li>
<li><strong>3:</strong> Status (cares about reputation, honor,
respect)</li>
<li><strong>4:</strong> Knowledge (curious, seeks information or
secrets)</li>
<li><strong>5:</strong> Connection (lonely, wants companionship or
allies)</li>
<li><strong>6:</strong> Duty (bound by obligation, follows rules or
orders)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I approach the tavern keeper for info about
the missing merchant.”</p>
<p><strong>Disposition Roll:</strong> 3 (Cautious)</p>
<p><strong>Goal Roll:</strong> 1 (Profit)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The tavern keeper knows something
but won’t talk for free. They hint at information, then wait for you to
offer coin. You can negotiate, intimidate, or walk away.</p>
<h3 id="surprise-discovery-tables">Surprise and Discovery Tables</h3>
<p>Solo play benefits from unexpected twists. When exploring or
investigating, roll for surprises to keep play dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Table (d6):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1:</strong> Setback (obstacle, trap, or complication)</li>
<li><strong>2:</strong> Empty (nothing useful, but no harm)</li>
<li><strong>3:</strong> Clue (progress toward goal)</li>
<li><strong>4:</strong> Resource (useful item, ally, or info)</li>
<li><strong>5:</strong> Opportunity (shortcut, advantage, or lucky
break)</li>
<li><strong>6:</strong> Twist (unexpected revelation that changes
context)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Searching a room</li>
<li>Traveling through wilderness</li>
<li>Investigating a mystery</li>
<li>Exploring unknown areas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I search the abandoned warehouse for clues
about the smugglers.”</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Roll:</strong> 6 (Twist)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> You find a ledger, but it’s coded in
a cipher you don’t recognize. Worse—the entries mention your employer’s
name. They’re connected to the smugglers. The mystery just got more
complicated.</p>
<h3 id="self-sufficient-character-builds">Self-Sufficient Character
Builds</h3>
<p>Solo play rewards <strong>generalist characters</strong> who handle
diverse challenges without party support. Specialists excel in groups
but struggle alone.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Skill Spread:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 Combat Skill</strong> (Melee or Ranged): Handle
threats</li>
<li><strong>1 Social Skill</strong> (Persuasion, Deception, Insight):
Negotiate and gather info</li>
<li><strong>1 Investigation Skill</strong> (Perception, Research): Find
clues and solve puzzles</li>
<li><strong>1 Technical/Survival Skill</strong> (Security, Survival,
Medicine): Handle practical challenges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid Narrow Specialization:</strong></p>
<p>If your only skills are combat-focused, non-combat scenes become
frustrating. If you specialize in social skills, solo combat becomes
deadly. Spread your capabilities across domains.</p>
<p><strong>Proficiencies for Solo Play:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Reliant:</strong> Bonus to Survival, Medicine, or
Crafting (handle injuries and gear maintenance)</li>
<li><strong>Streetwise:</strong> Access to contacts and information
(replaces party information-gathering)</li>
<li><strong>Combat Veteran:</strong> Bonus in fights (no party backup
means you need combat edge)</li>
<li><strong>Quick Thinker:</strong> Bonus to initiative or rerolls (act
first, survive longer)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Solo-Friendly Build:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Character:</strong> Kade, the Wandering Investigator</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Ranged Combat, Persuasion, Perception,
Survival <strong>Proficiencies:</strong> Streetwise (contacts),
Self-Reliant (first aid), Quick Thinker (initiative bonus)</p>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Kade can fight at range (safer than
melee), talk his way out of trouble, investigate scenes, and survive
wilderness travel. He’s not the best at any one thing, but he’s
competent across challenges common in solo play.</p>
<h3 id="pacing-clocks-solo">Pacing and Clocks in Solo Play</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Clocks</strong> track goals. <strong>Pressure
Clocks</strong> track dangers. In solo play, you set both clocks
yourself based on narrative logic.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Clock Guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple goals:</strong> 4 segments (find a contact,
investigate a scene)</li>
<li><strong>Complex goals:</strong> 6 segments (solve a mystery,
infiltrate a stronghold)</li>
<li><strong>Epic goals:</strong> 8-10 segments (defeat a major
antagonist, uncover conspiracy)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pressure Clock Guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate threats:</strong> 4 segments (guards arrive, enemy
closes in)</li>
<li><strong>Long-term threats:</strong> 6-8 segments (villain’s plan
unfolds, disease spreads)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tick Progress on Full Success, Pressure on
Partial/Fail.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Locate the hidden rebel base (Progress Clock:
0/6)</p>
<p><strong>Danger:</strong> Inquisitors hunting you (Pressure Clock:
0/6)</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1:</strong> You question a contact in the market. Roll
Persuasion vs. DC 14.</p>
<p><strong>Roll:</strong> 16 (Full Success)</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Progress ticks to 1/6. The contact gives you
a lead—check the old mill. Pressure doesn’t tick.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2:</strong> You sneak to the mill. Roll Stealth vs. DC
15.</p>
<p><strong>Roll:</strong> 13 (Partial Success)</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Progress ticks to 2/6 (you find evidence
rebels were here), but someone spots you leaving. Pressure ticks to 1/6
(inquisitors get a lead).</p>
<p><strong>Continue until Progress fills (success) or Pressure fills
(failure/escape).</strong></p>
<h3 id="solo-play-pitfalls">Solo Play Pitfalls</h3>
<p><strong>Over-Generous Oracles:</strong> Don’t roll oracle to confirm
what you want. If you want the door unlocked, that’s wish fulfillment,
not play. Roll oracle when the answer genuinely matters and you don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>Ignoring Consequences:</strong> Don’t erase failed rolls or
complications. Embrace setbacks—they create story tension. Solo play
without failure becomes boring.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis Paralysis:</strong> Don’t overthink every decision.
Set a timer (2 minutes) for major choices. If you can’t decide, roll a
die and commit. Forward momentum beats perfect planning.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Surprise:</strong> Use random tables liberally. If
you pre-plan everything, you’re not playing—you’re writing. Let tables
surprise you. Embrace unexpected results.</p>
<h3 id="solo-play-example">Solo Play Example: Full Scene</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re investigating a poisoning. Progress
clock “Identify Culprit” (0/4). Pressure clock “Assassin Escapes”
(0/4).</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1—Crime Scene Investigation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I search the victim’s room for clues. Is
anything obviously out of place?”</p>
<p><strong>Oracle Roll (Weighted—Likely, with Advantage):</strong> 5
(Yes)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> You spot a shattered vial under the
bed.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Check:</strong> Roll Perception + RSN vs. DC 14.</p>
<p><strong>Roll:</strong> 17 (Full Success)</p>
<p><strong>GM Hat:</strong> Progress ticks to 1/4. The vial has a
distinctive seal—House Vyreth’s apothecary.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2—Tracking the Source:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I head to House Vyreth’s apothecary. Are they
open at this hour?”</p>
<p><strong>Oracle Roll:</strong> 2 (No, but…)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Closed, but lights are on inside.
Someone’s there.</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I knock loudly and demand entry, showing my
investigator’s badge. Do they let me in?”</p>
<p><strong>NPC Disposition Roll:</strong> 3 (Cautious)</p>
<p><strong>NPC Goal Roll:</strong> 2 (Safety)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> They crack the door, nervous. “What
do you want?” They’re scared, not hostile.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Check:</strong> Roll Presence (intimidation) vs. DC
15.</p>
<p><strong>Roll:</strong> 14 (Partial Success)</p>
<p><strong>GM Hat:</strong> Progress ticks to 2/4 (they admit selling
the poison), but they panic and try to flee. Pressure ticks to 2/4
(assassin learns you’re closing in).</p>
<p><strong>Scene 3—Chasing the Lead:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I grab them before they bolt. Do they
resist?”</p>
<p><strong>Oracle Roll:</strong> 1 (No, and…)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> They collapse, sobbing. “Lady
Mirelle forced me! She’ll kill my family if I talk!”</p>
<p><strong>GM Hat:</strong> Progress ticks to 3/4. You have the
culprit’s name. Pressure ticks to 3/4 (Lady Mirelle knows you’re hunting
her—she’s preparing to flee).</p>
<p><strong>Scene 4—Confrontation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I rush to Lady Mirelle’s estate. Is she still
there?”</p>
<p><strong>Oracle Roll (Unlikely—Disadvantage):</strong> 3 (Yes,
but…)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> She’s there, but packing. You have
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Check:</strong> Roll AGI to sprint and intercept her
before she escapes, DC 16.</p>
<p><strong>Roll:</strong> 18 (Full Success)</p>
<p><strong>GM Hat:</strong> Progress ticks to 4/4 (clock complete). You
catch her at the door, ledger in hand. Guards arrive. Case solved.
Pressure clock stops at 3/4—you got her just in time.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oracles</strong> determined world state (shop open? Lady
Mirelle still there?)</li>
<li><strong>Skill checks</strong> determined your success at actions
(intimidate, chase)</li>
<li><strong>NPC tables</strong> created unpredictable behavior
(apothecary scared, not hostile)</li>
<li><strong>Clocks</strong> tracked dual pressures (progress
vs. escape)</li>
<li><strong>GM Hat</strong> adjudicated outcomes fairly, embracing
complications</li>
</ul>
<p>Solo play works when you balance player goals with honest GMing.
Don’t cheat yourself—embrace the unknown.</p>
<h2 id="duet-play">Duet Play (1 GM + 1 Player)</h2>
<p>Duet play—one GM, one player—creates intimate, character-focused
stories. With only one PC, pacing shifts: downtime matters more,
character development deepens, and stakes feel personal. The system
adapts easily, but GMs and players need to adjust expectations.</p>
<h3 id="duet-character-design">Character Design for Duet Play</h3>
<p>Without a party, your character needs broader capabilities:</p>
<p><strong>Generalist Over Specialist:</strong> Like solo play, duet
characters need combat, social, and investigation skills. Pure
specialists (all combat, no social) struggle when challenges fall
outside their domain.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Player Characters (VPCs):</strong> The GM might
provide a recurring VPC—a companion who travels with you. VPCs are loyal
but less capable than full PCs. They handle gaps in your skill set
(you’re a fighter, they’re a healer; you’re a socialite, they’re
muscle). VPCs follow your lead but aren’t replacements for party
dynamics. See GM Toolkit Chapter 09 for VPC creation guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Higher Power Level:</strong> Some GMs boost starting
attributes (+1 to all) or grant extra proficiencies to compensate for
lack of party support. Discuss with your GM.</p>
<h3 id="duet-pacing">Pacing Adjustments</h3>
<p><strong>Slower Advancement:</strong> With one player, sessions focus
deeply on your character’s arc. Advancement might trigger every 2-3
sessions instead of 3-4, since individual spotlight time is
concentrated.</p>
<p><strong>Shorter Combats:</strong> Resolve clocks for enemies should
be smaller (2-4 segments instead of 4-6). Duet combat drags without
party action economy, so fights resolve faster.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasis on Relationships:</strong> NPCs matter more. Your
character’s connections— allies, rivals, mentors, enemies—drive the
story. Invest in relationships; they create narrative momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Lethality:</strong> One PC means no backup. GMs should
telegraph danger clearly and offer escape routes. Failure should
complicate, not kill, unless stakes were explicitly established.</p>
<h3 id="duet-play-example">Duet Play Example</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> You’re a freelance investigator hired to find
a missing scholar. Your VPC companion, Marcus (loyal assistant, handles
research and first aid), accompanies you.</p>
<p><strong>Scene:</strong> You arrive at the scholar’s apartment. The
door is ajar.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The apartment is dark. You hear movement
inside—someone’s searching the place. Marcus whispers, ‘Could be the
scholar, or whoever took them.’ What do you do?”</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> “I signal Marcus to stay back and peek inside.
Do I see who’s searching?”</p>
<p><strong>Skill Check:</strong> Roll Perception + RSN vs. DC 13.</p>
<p><strong>Roll:</strong> 15 (Full Success)</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “A cloaked figure rifles through papers. They
pocket something—a letter. You notice their belt: City Watch insignia.
This isn’t a burglar; it’s a guard covering something up.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences from Group Play:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marcus (VPC)</strong> provides backup but doesn’t act
independently—he follows your lead</li>
<li><strong>Pacing is slower:</strong> GM describes details because
you’re the only observer</li>
<li><strong>Stakes are clear:</strong> GM telegraphs danger (guard is
armed, but unaware of you)</li>
<li><strong>Choices matter more:</strong> No party debate—your decision
drives the scene</li>
</ul>
<p>Duet play rewards deep character investment and tight GM-player
collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="gm-less-play">GM-less Play (Rotating Authority)</h2>
<p>GM-less play distributes GMing responsibilities across all players.
One player might frame a scene, another adjudicates a roll, a third
portrays an NPC. This mode requires trust, clear communication, and
structured turn-taking to avoid chaos.</p>
<h3 id="authority-rotation">Authority Rotation Models</h3>
<p><strong>Scene Framing:</strong> One player sets the scene (“We’re in
a tavern. A hooded stranger approaches”). Others play their characters.
Scene framer doesn’t have final say on outcomes—group consensus or dice
decide.</p>
<p><strong>Round-Robin GMing:</strong> Rotate GM duties each session or
scene. Player A GMs Scene 1, Player B GMs Scene 2, etc. The “current GM”
adjudicates DCs, portrays NPCs, and frames consequences. When it’s your
turn to GM, your PC takes a backseat (VPC status—present but not in
spotlight).</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Adjudication:</strong> When outcomes are
uncertain, discuss as a group. “Does the guard believe my lie?” Group
votes or defers to dice (oracle roll). Avoid arguing—set a 30-second
timer for decisions.</p>
<h3 id="gm-less-tools">Tools for GM-less Play</h3>
<p><strong>Oracle Rolls (Group Version):</strong> Use solo play oracles
(d6 yes/no tables) for world questions. “Is the vault guarded?” Someone
rolls, everyone interprets together.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Set DCs:</strong> Before play, agree on DC ranges: Easy
(10-12), Moderate (13-15), Hard (16-18). When someone declares an
action, the group agrees on difficulty before rolling.</p>
<p><strong>NPC Behavior Tables:</strong> Use solo play NPC
disposition/goal tables. When a new NPC appears, roll for disposition
and goals. Whoever rolled portrays them for that scene.</p>
<p><strong>Progress and Pressure Clocks:</strong> Visible to everyone.
Any player can suggest ticking a clock; group consensus or GM-for-scene
decides.</p>
<h3 id="gm-less-pitfalls">GM-less Play Pitfalls</h3>
<p><strong>Lack of Narrative Drive:</strong> Without a GM to push
conflict, scenes stall. Assign one player as “conflict advocate” each
session—their job is to introduce complications when things feel too
easy.</p>
<p><strong>Player Favoritism:</strong> Don’t soft-adjudicate for
yourself. If it’s your turn to GM and your PC attempts something risky,
let someone else set the DC or adjudicate the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis Paralysis:</strong> Group decisions take time. Use
timers (30 seconds for minor choices, 2 minutes for major) to maintain
momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Unbalanced Spotlight:</strong> Track who’s had focus. If one
player dominates three scenes, shift spotlight deliberately. “Let’s
frame a scene for [quieter player].”</p>
<h3 id="gm-less-example">GM-less Example</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Three players (Alice, Bob, Clara) playing
freelance mercenaries. They’re negotiating payment with a noble for a
bodyguard job.</p>
<p><strong>Alice (Scene Framer):</strong> “We’re in the noble’s manor.
He’s nervous—tapping his fingers, glancing at the door. Bob, you’re
leading negotiations. What do you say?”</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> “I lean forward. ‘We’ve heard rumors about
threats on your life. We’re the best, but the best costs. Five hundred
gold, half upfront.’”</p>
<p><strong>Clara (Current GM):</strong> “He hesitates. ‘Three hundred.
That’s my limit.’ This is a negotiation contest. Roll Presence vs. his
Presence. I’ll roll for him. DC 15.”</p>
<p><strong>Bob rolls:</strong> 13 (Partial Success)</p>
<p><strong>Clara (GM):</strong> “He agrees to four hundred but adds a
condition: ‘You stay until the gala next week, not just tonight.’
Pressure clock ‘Noble’s Enemies Act’ starts at 0/4. You just committed
to a longer job.”</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alice framed</strong> the scene but didn’t GM it</li>
<li><strong>Clara adjudicated</strong> the roll and set
consequences</li>
<li><strong>Group decided</strong> together that a pressure clock made
sense</li>
<li><strong>Bob accepted</strong> the Partial outcome without
arguing</li>
</ul>
<p>GM-less play works when everyone commits to collaborative
storytelling and fair adjudication.</p>
<h2 id="online-play">Online Play</h2>
<p>Playing over the internet using virtual tabletops (VTTs) or
voice/video chat requires adapting communication, tools, and pacing. The
core mechanics stay the same, but technical and social considerations
shift.</p>
<h3 id="platform-choices">Platform Choices</h3>
<p><strong>Voice/Video Only (Discord, Zoom):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple setup, no learning curve, flexible for
theater-of-the-mind play</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> No visual aids, harder to track
initiative/clocks, relies on verbal description</li>
<li><strong>Best For:</strong> Low-prep games,
investigation/social-heavy campaigns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtual Tabletops (Roll20, Foundry VTT, Owlbear
Rodeo):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Visual maps, token movement, integrated dice
rollers, shared character sheets</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Setup time, learning curve, potential for
technical issues</li>
<li><strong>Best For:</strong> Combat-heavy games, tactical play, groups
that like visual reference</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hybrid (Voice + Shared Docs):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Flexibility, shared clocks/notes in Google
Docs, voice chat for play</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires discipline (everyone updates docs),
no map visuals</li>
<li><strong>Best For:</strong> Medium crunch, investigation-focused
play</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="online-communication">Communication Best Practices</h3>
<p><strong>Establish Speaking Order:</strong> Without in-person body
language, people talk over each other. Use “speaking order” in tense
scenes (GM calls on players) or “raise hand” features in video
tools.</p>
<p><strong>State Intent Clearly:</strong> “I want to sneak past the
guard using the shadows” is clearer than “I roll Stealth” in text-only
environments. Typing intent before rolling prevents confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Use Shared Resources:</strong> Post progress/pressure clocks
in shared docs or VTT notes so everyone sees current state. This
prevents “wait, how many segments are filled?” questions.</p>
<p><strong>Camera Usage:</strong> Video isn’t mandatory but helps.
Seeing faces improves engagement and lets the GM read reactions. If
someone’s camera-shy, that’s fine—voice-only works.</p>
<p><strong>Break More Often:</strong> Online fatigue is real. Take
10-minute breaks every 90 minutes, not just at the 2-hour mark. Stretch,
hydrate, rest eyes.</p>
<h3 id="online-technical">Technical Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Dice Rolling:</strong> Use VTT built-in rollers, Discord bots
(Avrae, Sidekick), or honor-system self-rolls. Trust your group unless
you’ve had problems.</p>
<p><strong>Latency and Lag:</strong> If someone has poor internet,
simplify visual assets (fewer high-res maps, lighter VTT scenes).
Consider text-first play for critical scenes if lag is severe.</p>
<p><strong>Session Zero for Tools:</strong> Test your VTT or voice
platform in Session Zero. Make sure everyone can connect, roll dice, and
hear each other. Fix issues before play starts.</p>
<p><strong>Backup Plans:</strong> Have a secondary communication method
(Discord backup if Zoom fails). Save VTT sessions frequently to avoid
data loss.</p>
<h3 id="online-pacing">Pacing Adjustments</h3>
<p><strong>Shorter Sessions:</strong> 2-3 hours works better online than
4-hour marathons. Fatigue hits faster without in-person energy.</p>
<p><strong>Clearer Scene Transitions:</strong> “We’re moving to a new
scene—you’re now at the docks” is more necessary online. Without
physical presence, players miss GM body language signaling
transitions.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Aids:</strong> Use images (Pinterest, AI-generated
art, reference photos) for NPCs, locations, or key items. Drop them in
chat. Online play lacks in-person gestures; images compensate.</p>
<p><strong>Explicit Recaps:</strong> Start each session with a 2-minute
recap of last session’s events. Memory fades more online—nobody sees
your GM notes between sessions.</p>
<h3 id="online-pitfalls">Online-Specific Pitfalls</h3>
<p><strong>Multitasking Players:</strong> It’s tempting to browse, text,
or game during online sessions. Establish norms: phones down, no
alt-tabbing during play (or at least minimize it).</p>
<p><strong>Mic Discipline:</strong> Mute when not speaking (background
noise is distracting). Use push-to-talk if your environment is loud.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Troubleshooting Mid-Session:</strong> If someone can’t
connect, don’t halt play for 20 minutes. Give them 5 minutes to rejoin;
if they can’t, narrate their PC as “busy with another task” and loop
them in later.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Social Energy:</strong> Online play can feel flat.
Compensate with music, ambient sound (rain, tavern noise), and
enthusiastic GMing. Energy doesn’t translate automatically through
screens—you have to project it.</p>
<h3 id="online-play-example">Online Play Example</h3>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Four players on Roll20 with Discord voice. GM
shares a city map and places tokens.</p>
<p><strong>GM (in Discord):</strong> “You’re outside the warehouse. Rain
is pouring—Disadvantage to Perception checks. I’ve placed your tokens.
Mira, what do you do?”</p>
<p><strong>Mira (typing in Roll20 chat):</strong> “I move to the side
door and check if it’s locked.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “Roll Security. DC 14.”</p>
<p><strong>Mira (using Roll20 dice roller):</strong> [Rolls 16] “Got it.
16 total.”</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> “The lock clicks open. You’re in. The warehouse
is dark—three crates in the center, a figure moving in the back.
Everyone roll Initiative.”</p>
<p><strong>GM (sharing an image in Discord):</strong> [Posts reference
image of a shadowy warehouse interior]</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typed intent</strong> (Mira in chat) clarifies actions</li>
<li><strong>Shared map</strong> shows positions visually</li>
<li><strong>Integrated rolls</strong> (Roll20 roller) keep dice
transparent</li>
<li><strong>Visual aids</strong> (warehouse image) enhance
immersion</li>
<li><strong>Clear narration</strong> (GM describes explicitly, no body
language cues)</li>
</ul>
<p>Online play requires intentional communication and technical fluency,
but the game itself remains unchanged.</p>

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD025 -->
<h1 id="ph-player-tips-for-success">Player Tips for Success</h1>
<h2 id="planning--preparation">Planning &amp; Preparation</h2>
<p><strong>Before Sessions:</strong> Review your character sheet. Check
goals, unresolved plot threads, and active conditions. Know what you
want to pursue.</p>
<p><strong>Take Notes:</strong> Track NPCs, locations, clues, and
promises. You won’t remember everything. Notes prevent missed
opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Set Goals:</strong> What does your character want this
session? Clear goals focus your choices and give the GM material to work
with.</p>
<h2 id="tactical-tips">Tactical Tips</h2>
<p><strong>Use Terrain:</strong> Seek <em>Elevated</em> positions for
ranged attacks. Fight in <em>Dim Light</em> for stealth. Create
<em>Fragile Cover</em> with Set Up actions. Terrain is a tool.</p>
<p><strong>Manage Resources:</strong> Don’t hoard gear or favors. Spend
them when they create advantage. Unused resources are wasted
resources.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritize Threats:</strong> Clear dangerous conditions
(<em>Bleeding</em>, <em>Exposed</em>) fast. Focus fire on high-priority
enemies. Control space with maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate Actions:</strong> Set Up for allies. Create
openings. Combine tactics. Group coordination multiplies
effectiveness.</p>
<h2 id="reading-the-table">Reading the Table</h2>
<p><strong>GM Cues:</strong> When the GM lingers on a detail, it
matters. “The guard seems nervous” invites investigation. “The floor
creaks” warns of danger.</p>
<p><strong>NPC Intentions:</strong> Watch how NPCs react. Hesitation,
eye contact, defensive posture—these signal motivations. Ask Insight
checks when uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Partial Success creates openings.
Failure escalates tension but adds new information. Outcomes aren’t dead
ends; they’re hooks for next actions.</p>
<h2 id="collaborative-success">Collaborative Success</h2>
<p><strong>Support Each Other:</strong> If someone’s pinned down, create
an opening. If someone’s investigating, offer assistance. Shared
victories feel better.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate Plans:</strong> “I’ll distract the guard; you
slip past.” Coordination requires communication.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrate Wins Together:</strong> When someone pulls off a
brilliant move, recognize it. Table energy builds momentum.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-tactical-thinking">Advanced Tactical Thinking</h2>
<h3 id="action-economy-optimization">Action Economy Optimization</h3>
<p><strong>Eliminate Threats Fast:</strong> The faster you reduce enemy
numbers, the fewer actions they get per round. Focus fire on wounded
enemies to even the odds.</p>
<p><strong>Use Set Up Actions for Compound Advantage:</strong> One Set
Up action grants Advantage to multiple allies if they coordinate. “I
suppress the sniper—who’s taking the shot?”</p>
<p><strong>Force Disadvantage on Key Enemies:</strong> If you can’t kill
the boss fast, make them roll with Disadvantage. Maneuvers (blind,
suppress, trip) reduce their effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Control Space with Positioning:</strong> Occupy choke points,
hold high ground, block escape routes. Positioning limits enemy options
without spending actions.</p>
<h3 id="resource-management">Resource Management</h3>
<p><strong>Spend Resources on Turning Points:</strong> Don’t hoard
favors or gear for “emergencies.” Emergencies are happening now. Use
advantages when they matter.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage Contacts and Relationships:</strong> If you’ve built
relationships with NPCs (see Chapter 10), call in favors when stuck.
NPCs can provide intel, gear, or backup.</p>
<p><strong>Track Conditions and Recovery:</strong> Don’t ignore
<em>Exhausted</em> or <em>Bleeding</em>. Clear conditions before they
compound. One bad condition can cascade into worse outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for Downtime:</strong> Use downtime between missions to
train, research, craft, or build relationships. Downtime investment pays
off in future missions.</p>
<h2 id="problem-solving-strategies">Problem-Solving Strategies</h2>
<h3 id="when-combat-goes-badly">When Combat Goes Badly</h3>
<p><strong>Retreat is Tactical:</strong> If outnumbered or outmatched,
use Defend/Withdraw to break contact. Live to fight another day with
better preparation.</p>
<p><strong>Change the Terrain:</strong> Create <em>Hazardous</em> zones
(knock over oil lamps, trigger traps, collapse structures). Even the
odds by making the environment dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Exploit Enemy Weaknesses:</strong> If they’re grouped, use
area effects. If they’re reckless, bait them into traps. If they’re
cautious, press aggressively.</p>
<p><strong>Call for Help:</strong> If you have allies (contacts, VPCs,
nearby friendlies), call them in. Don’t die alone when help exists.</p>
<h3 id="when-investigation-stalls">When Investigation Stalls</h3>
<p><strong>Revisit Known Clues:</strong> Look for connections you
missed. “The guard mentioned the docks—didn’t we find shipping manifests
earlier?”</p>
<p><strong>Ask NPCs Direct Questions:</strong> If stuck, go back to NPCs
and ask directly. “We know you’re hiding something. What aren’t you
telling us?”</p>
<p><strong>Use Downtime to Research:</strong> If progress stalls, spend
downtime researching (see Chapter 10). Tick progress on investigation
clocks during downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Take Risks for Information:</strong> Sometimes you need to
provoke a reaction. Confront suspects, stake out locations, or follow
leads even if dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="when-social-situations-turn-hostile">When Social Situations Turn
Hostile</h3>
<p><strong>De-escalate with Concessions:</strong> Offer something they
want (information, favors, compromise). De-escalation prevents violence
when outmatched.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage Reputation or Threats:</strong> If you’ve built
reputation, use it. “You know who I work for—do you really want this
fight?”</p>
<p><strong>Change the Frame:</strong> Reframe the negotiation. “We’re
not enemies—we both want the same thing.” Find common ground.</p>
<p><strong>Know When to Walk Away:</strong> If negotiation fails,
disengage. Not every social conflict needs resolution right now.</p>
<h2 id="session-zero-and-table-expectations">Session Zero and Table
Expectations</h2>
<h3 id="setting-expectations">Setting Expectations</h3>
<p><strong>Discuss Play Style:</strong> Are you playing for tactical
challenge, narrative drama, exploration, or social intrigue? Align
expectations early.</p>
<p><strong>Establish Boundaries:</strong> Use safety tools (X-Card,
Lines &amp; Veils) to define content boundaries. Everyone should feel
safe at the table.</p>
<p><strong>Agree on Tone:</strong> Gritty noir? Heroic fantasy?
Lighthearted adventure? Tone affects how you approach scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Clarify Spotlight Sharing:</strong> How much “screentime”
does each player get? Some tables rotate evenly; others follow narrative
flow. Discuss preferences.</p>
<h3 id="building-party-cohesion">Building Party Cohesion</h3>
<p><strong>Create Shared Backstory:</strong> Why is your party together?
Shared goals, mutual debts, common enemies, or circumstantial alliance.
Define it before play starts.</p>
<p><strong>Establish Trust Early:</strong> If characters don’t trust
each other, the party fractures. Build trust through early shared
challenges or backstory connections.</p>
<p><strong>Respect Character Concepts:</strong> Don’t undermine others’
concepts. If someone plays a diplomat, let them negotiate. If someone
plays a rogue, let them scout.</p>
<h3 id="handling-disagreements">Handling Disagreements</h3>
<p><strong>Distinguish Character vs. Player Conflict:</strong>
In-character disagreements are fine. Player disagreements need
out-of-character resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Talk Through Impasses:</strong> If players can’t agree on a
plan, pause and discuss meta. “What are we trying to accomplish
here?”</p>
<p><strong>GM as Tiebreaker:</strong> If stuck, let the GM frame stakes
and move forward. “You can debate, but the pressure clock is
ticking—what do you do?”</p>
<h2 id="spotlight-sharing-and-table-dynamics">Spotlight Sharing and
Table Dynamics</h2>
<h3 id="recognizing-when-to-step-forward">Recognizing When to Step
Forward</h3>
<p><strong>Your Expertise is Needed:</strong> If the situation matches
your skills (combat for fighters, investigation for detectives), step
up. That’s your moment.</p>
<p><strong>Others Are Stuck:</strong> If the table is silent or
uncertain, propose a plan. “I think we should—” breaks paralysis.</p>
<p><strong>Your Character Has Motivation:</strong> If the scene aligns
with your character’s goals or fears, take the lead. Personal stakes
create engagement.</p>
<h3 id="recognizing-when-to-step-back">Recognizing When to Step
Back</h3>
<p><strong>Someone Else’s Expertise Fits:</strong> If another
character’s skills are relevant, let them lead. Support them with Set Up
actions or assistance.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve Been Center Stage:</strong> If you’ve dominated the
last 2-3 scenes, step back. Let others shine.</p>
<p><strong>The Scene is Someone Else’s Arc:</strong> If a scene is about
another character’s backstory or motivation, be the supporting cast. Ask
questions, offer help, react.</p>
<h3 id="handling-quiet-players">Handling Quiet Players</h3>
<p><strong>Create Openings:</strong> “What do you think, [Character
Name]?” or “Your character has experience with this—what’s your
take?”</p>
<p><strong>Offer Assists:</strong> “I’ll help you with that—let’s
combine our efforts.” Shared actions reduce pressure on quiet
players.</p>
<p><strong>Respect Different Play Styles:</strong> Some players are
quieter by nature. That’s fine. Don’t force them into spotlight they
don’t want.</p>

<h2 id="common-character-sheet-mistakes">Common Character Sheet
Mistakes</h2>
<h3 id="mistake-1-over-specialization">Mistake 1:
Over-Specialization</h3>
<p><strong>Error:</strong> All skills and proficiencies focused on one
area (e.g., pure combat, zero social or investigation).</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You’re ineffective when situations fall
outside your domain. The party carries you through non-combat
scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Spread skills across 2-3 areas. Combat
specialist? Add Perception or Tactics. Social character? Add at least
one combat or utility skill.</p>
<h3 id="mistake-2-ignoring-attributes">Mistake 2: Ignoring
Attributes</h3>
<p><strong>Error:</strong> All attributes at +0 or +1. Skills compensate
for weak base stats.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Without strong attributes, your skill
bonuses are undercut. You need both to succeed consistently.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Focus 1-2 attributes to +2 or higher. Let
skills and proficiencies build on strong foundations.</p>
<h3 id="mistake-3-redundant-skills">Mistake 3: Redundant Skills</h3>
<p><strong>Error:</strong> Taking overlapping skills that do the same
thing (<em>Blades</em> and <em>Brawling</em> both cover melee;
<em>Stealth</em> and <em>Infiltration</em> are redundant).</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Wasted picks. You could have
diversified.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Cover different niches. One combat skill, one
social, one investigation, one utility. Avoid redundancy.</p>
<h3 id="mistake-4-no-resources-or-connections">Mistake 4: No Resources
or Connections</h3>
<p><strong>Error:</strong> Gear and skills defined, but no contacts, no
faction ties, no backstory hooks.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You’re disconnected from the world. No
leverage, no narrative ties.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Define at least 2-3 contacts or faction
relationships. These create story hooks and provide resources.</p>
<h3 id="mistake-5-unclear-concept">Mistake 5: Unclear Concept</h3>
<p><strong>Error:</strong> Stats exist, but no clear character concept.
“What do you do?” “Uh… I have Blades and Stealth?”</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You don’t know how to roleplay the
character. Concept guides choices.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Write a one-sentence concept: <em>Cynical
detective seeking redemption</em>, <em>Reckless smuggler with a heart of
gold</em>, <em>Haunted scholar running from the past</em>. Let stats
support concept, not define it.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-character-creation">Troubleshooting Character
Creation</h2>
<h3 id="my-character-feels-weak">“My character feels weak.”</h3>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check if attributes support your skills. High skill without high
attribute = inconsistent success.</li>
<li>Check if you’re using proficiencies. Proficiencies grant narrative
permissions and mechanical edges.</li>
<li>Check if you’re leveraging gear and resources. Contacts, tools, and
favors create advantages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Focus attributes, align skills with attributes,
use proficiencies and gear actively.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-fit-with-the-party">“I don’t fit with the party.”</h3>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check if your skills overlap too much (two investigators, no combat)
or too little (no shared goals).</li>
<li>Check if backstory ties you to the party. No shared history = weak
cohesion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Adjust skills to fill gaps. Add backstory
connection to at least one party member. Discuss party composition in
Session Zero.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-know-what-to-do-in-scenes">“I don’t know what to do in
scenes.”</h3>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check if your skills are too narrow. If you only have combat skills,
non-combat scenes leave you sidelined.</li>
<li>Check if you have clear motivations. No goals = no drive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Diversify skills. Define clear motivations
(revenge, redemption, curiosity, survival). Ask GM for scenes that
engage your character.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19: Character Creation Overview</h1>
<p>Creating a memorable player character requires balancing three
elements: <strong>identity</strong> (who they are), <strong>mechanical
foundations</strong> (what they can do), and <strong>narrative
purpose</strong> (why they matter to the story). This chapter provides
the framework for building characters that feel authentic at the table
and drive compelling play.</p>
<h2 id="character-philosophy">Character Philosophy</h2>
<p>Every player character in this system is built on three pillars:</p>
<p><strong>Fiction-First Identity</strong>: Start with who the character
is—their role, personality, motivations, and place in the world.
Mechanics should emerge from and support this identity, not dictate it.
A character’s concept drives their skills, proficiencies, and narrative
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Coherence</strong>: While identity comes first,
mechanics matter. Skills and proficiencies should reflect what a
character knows and can do. Tags and conditions should capture how they
interact with the world. This guide helps you translate fictional
concepts into mechanical choices that make sense at the table.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative Purpose</strong>: Player characters are
protagonists who drive the story forward through choices and actions.
Your character needs complex motivations, meaningful relationships, and
room to change. Understanding your character’s narrative purpose ensures
they contribute to play in compelling ways.</p>
<p>Throughout the following chapters, you’ll see these three pillars in
action. Worked examples show characters developing from concept
(identity) through mechanical frameworks (coherence) to story
integration (narrative purpose).</p>
<h2 id="identity">Identity: The Foundation</h2>
<p>Identity is where every character begins. Before you assign a single
skill point or choose proficiencies, answer these core questions:</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: What does this character do in the world? Are
they a baker, a knight, a detective, a pilot? Role grounds the character
in their setting and immediately suggests skills, knowledge, and social
connections.</p>
<p><strong>Personality</strong>: How do they approach problems and
interact with others? Are they cautious or bold, compassionate or
pragmatic, methodical or impulsive? Personality shapes decision-making
at the table and creates friction or synergy with other characters.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: What drives them to act? What do they
want, and why does it matter to them? Motivation provides the engine for
character choices and creates natural hooks for story integration.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Where did they come from, and what
shaped them? Background informs skills (a soldier has combat training; a
scholar has academic knowledge), relationships (family, mentors,
rivals), and secrets (events they hide or regrets they carry).</p>
<p>These questions create a framework that makes every subsequent choice
easier. When you know a character’s role, personality, motivation, and
background, selecting skills becomes obvious rather than arbitrary. A
cautious detective investigating a murder naturally takes Investigation,
Deduction, and Interview skills. A bold pilot seeking glory in the void
naturally takes Piloting, Navigation, and Tactics.</p>
<h2 id="mechanical-foundations">Mechanical Foundations</h2>
<p>Once you have a clear identity, translate it into mechanical choices
that support and express that character at the table:</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose 3-5 skills from the Mechanics
Reference (Chapters 6-11) that reflect what your character knows and can
do. Skills should flow directly from their role and background. A baker
takes Cooking, Hospitality, and Negotiation. A mercenary takes Melee
Combat, Tactics, and Athletics. Skills are your character’s primary
mechanical expression—they determine what situations they can engage
with confidently.</p>
<p><strong>Proficiencies</strong>: Select 2-4 proficiencies from the
Mechanics Reference (Chapters 13-17) that represent specialized
knowledge, tools, or cultural competencies. Proficiencies add flavor and
create advantages in specific contexts. A knight might have Court
Etiquette and Armored Combat proficiencies. A hacker might have
Encryption Tools and Corporate Protocols. Proficiencies create moments
where your character’s specific background makes them uniquely
qualified.</p>
<p><strong>Tags</strong>: Tags (see Mechanics Reference, Chapter 18)
describe qualities that affect position and effect in scenes. Some tags
come from identity (“Helpful,” “Proud,” “Curious”), while others emerge
from circumstances (“Exhausted,” “Inspired,” “By-the-Book”). Tags
provide narrative texture and mechanical leverage, turning abstract
qualities into concrete scene effects.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Gear</strong>: Equipment should match the
character’s role and resources. A wandering bard carries different tools
than a corporate security chief. Gear isn’t just a shopping list—it
tells a story about preparation, priorities, and access to
resources.</p>
<p>The goal is mechanical coherence: when someone reads your character’s
skill list, they should immediately understand who that character is
without reading the backstory.</p>
<h2 id="fiction-first-design">Fiction-First Design Process</h2>
<p>Start with fiction, then add mechanics. Here’s the step-by-step
process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Concept</strong>: Write 1-2 sentences describing who the
character is, what they do, and why they matter. Example: “Tomas is a
disgraced knight seeking redemption through protecting the innocent. He
carries shame from a past failure but refuses to abandon his
code.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Role &amp; Personality</strong>: Define their role in the
world and 2-3 personality traits. Example: “Wandering protector.
Honorable, Haunted, Compassionate.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Motivation &amp; Goals</strong>: Identify what drives
them and what they want. Example: “Wants to prove his honor isn’t dead
despite his failure. Seeks a cause worth dying for.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose 3-5 skills that let them do what
their concept requires. Example: “Melee Combat, Intimidation,
Investigation.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proficiencies</strong>: Add 2-3 proficiencies for
specialized knowledge. Example: “Knight’s Code, Armored
Combat.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backstory &amp; Secrets</strong>: Create 1-2 hooks that
connect them to the world and other characters. Example: “Failed to save
his lord from assassination; knows the killer but can’t prove
it.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Narrative Purpose</strong>: Define how they function in
the story. Example: “Protagonist driven by redemption. Creates hooks
around justice, honor, and second chances.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Refinement</strong>: Review the complete character. Do
the mechanics support the fiction? Does the character fulfill their
narrative purpose? Adjust as needed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This process creates characters that feel authentic, play smoothly,
and contribute meaningfully to your campaign.</p>
<h2 id="cross-genre-principles">Cross-Genre Principles</h2>
<p>These design principles work across all genres because they focus on
universal character elements rather than setting-specific details:</p>
<p><strong>Role transcends genre</strong>: A “protector” archetype works
as a knight (fantasy), a bodyguard (modern), a ship’s security chief
(sci-fi), a neighborhood watch captain (cozy), or a haunted guardian
(horror). The core identity—someone who shields others—translates
directly while the mechanical expression changes to fit genre
expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation is universal</strong>: Characters driven by duty,
revenge, curiosity, greed, love, or fear work in any setting. The
objects of those motivations change (protecting a village vs. protecting
a space station), but the emotional core remains constant.</p>
<p>When adapting a character concept between genres, keep the identity
and narrative purpose intact while swapping skills and proficiencies for
genre-appropriate equivalents. A fantasy mage becomes a modern hacker or
a sci-fi technomancer—the role (specialist who manipulates complex
systems) and purpose (solve problems others can’t) remain; the tools and
terminology shift.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-04">Chapter 04: PC Archetypes by Genre</h1>
<p>Player characters are the heart of every story. Whether baking bread
in a cozy village, wielding swords in ancient ruins, investigating
supernatural horrors, navigating corporate intrigue, or piloting
starships across galaxies, PCs need clear identities that feel both
mechanically coherent and narratively rich.</p>
<p>This chapter provides ready-to-use archetypes organized by genre.
Each archetype includes concept, core skills, proficiencies, starting
gear, backstory hooks, and examples in play. Use these as drop-in
templates for quick character creation or as customization starting
points for more developed characters.</p>
<p>For mechanical details on skills, see Mechanics Reference Guide
Chapters 07-11 (genre skills). For proficiencies, see Chapters 13-17.
For backstory development, see Chapter 06.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use Archetypes</h2>
<p>Archetypes are fiction-first templates that provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concept</strong>: A clear character identity and role</li>
<li><strong>Core Skills</strong>: 3-5 skills from the Mechanics
Reference Guide that define the archetype’s capabilities</li>
<li><strong>Proficiencies</strong>: 2-3 specialized proficiencies that
support the archetype</li>
<li><strong>Starting Gear</strong>: Genre-appropriate equipment to begin
play</li>
<li><strong>Backstory Hook</strong>: A narrative seed for character
development</li>
<li><strong>Example in Play</strong>: A brief vignette showing the
archetype in action</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quick Creation</strong>: Choose an archetype, note the skills
and proficiencies, select starting gear, and begin play.</p>
<p><strong>Customization</strong>: Swap one or two skills for others
from the same genre chapter, adjust proficiencies to fit your concept,
and develop the backstory hook into a full character history (see
Chapter 06).</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Genre Play</strong>: Many archetypes translate across
genres. A Cozy Baker becomes a Sci-Fi ship’s cook. A Fantasy Warrior
becomes a Modern soldier. Use the template as a foundation and adjust
skills to the new setting.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="cozy-archetypes">Cozy Archetypes</h2>
<p>Cozy archetypes celebrate domestic mastery, artisan crafts, and
community connection. They excel at creating comfort, building
relationships, and nurturing growth.</p>
<h3 id="pc-cozy-baker">Baker/Chef</h3>
<p><strong>Concept</strong>: You transform flour, butter, and patience
into warmth. Your kitchen is a sanctuary, and your food brings people
together. Whether running a bakery, managing an inn, or feeding
travelers, you create nourishment that feeds body and spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Core Skills</strong> (see Ch. 07): - <a
href="#skill-baking">Baking</a> — Your specialty; bread, pastries, and
contest-worthy creations - <a href="#skill-cooking">Cooking</a> —
Everyday meals and improvised feasts - <a
href="#skill-hospitality">Hospitality</a> — Welcoming guests and
creating comfort</p>
<p><strong>Proficiencies</strong> (see Ch. 13): - Baker — Advantage on
baking checks, knowledge of ovens and ingredients - Festival Organizer —
Planning community events centered around food</p>
<p><strong>Starting Gear</strong>: Professional oven or hearth access,
quality baking tools, starter ingredients (flour, butter, sugar, yeast),
recipe book, apron, market connections for fresh ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Backstory Hook</strong>: You learned to bake from a family
member who taught you that food is love made visible. Now you run your
own establishment, but you are still perfecting the one recipe they
never shared—their secret signature dish.</p>
<p><strong>Example in Play</strong>: The village festival is tomorrow,
and the mayor’s birthday cake must be perfect. You roll Baking (DC 18)
and succeed with a 19. Your three-tier berry cake becomes the
centerpiece of the celebration, earning you the Mayor’s Favor tag and a
commission for the upcoming harvest feast.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="pc-cozy-librarian">Librarian/Scholar</h3>
<p><strong>Concept</strong>: You are the keeper of knowledge and
stories. Your library is not just books—it is memory, history, and
connection. You help people find answers, organize community records,
and preserve what might otherwise be lost.</p>
<p><strong>Core Skills</strong> (see Ch. 07): - <a
href="#skill-research">Research</a> — Finding information in archives
and texts (use Research from Ch. 09 if available) - <a
href="#skill-comfort">Comfort</a> — Helping patrons process what they
learn - <a href="#skill-mediation">Mediation</a> — Resolving disputes
over interpretations or access</p>
<p><strong>Proficiencies</strong> (see Ch. 13): - Archivist — Knowledge
of organization systems and rare texts - Homekeeper — Maintaining the
library space and creating welcoming atmosphere</p>
<p><strong>Starting Gear</strong>: Personal collection of reference
books, catalog system (ledger or cards), reading lamp, comfortable
chair, tea service, library key, patron records.</p>
<p><strong>Backstory Hook</strong>: A mysterious section of the library
was sealed by the previous librarian. You recently found the key and are
deciding whether to open it—some knowledge might be better left
hidden.</p>
<p><strong>Example in Play</strong>: Two farmers argue over a property
boundary mentioned in old land deeds. You roll Research (DC 16) and
Mediation (DC 16). With a 17 and 18, you find the original survey map
and broker a fair compromise. Both farmers leave satisfied, and you gain
the Trusted Mediator tag.</p>
<hr />

whether it is a tool or a threat.</p>
<p><strong>Example in Play</strong>: The ship’s reactor overloads during
combat. You roll System Engineering (DC 20) to stabilize it. You succeed

<p><strong>Example in Play</strong>: An alien creature attacks the
colony. You roll Xenobiology (DC 18) to analyze its biology and find
weaknesses. You succeed with a 19—identifying a vulnerable spot in its
exoskeleton and granting the team Advantage on combat checks against
it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="using-archetypes">Using PC Archetypes</h2>
<p>Archetypes provide narrative identity and mechanical coherence. When
creating PCs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Concept First</strong>: Pick the archetype that
resonates with the character you want to play.</li>
<li><strong>Adapt to Setting</strong>: Swap skills and proficiencies to
fit the specific campaign world or GM’s guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Develop Backstory</strong>: Use the backstory hook as a
seed. Expand it with motivations, relationships, and secrets (see
Chapter 06).</li>
<li><strong>Mix and Match</strong>: Combine skills from different
archetypes within the same genre to create hybrid characters (a Fantasy
Warrior who studies Arcana, a Cozy Baker who also Forages).</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Genre Translation</strong>: Adapt archetypes to new
genres by swapping skills while keeping the core concept (a Detective
becomes a Sci-Fi investigator using Surveillance and Hacking).</li>

<h1 id="chapter-05">Chapter 05: PC Templates and Kits</h1>
<p>Templates are plug-and-play mechanical bundles designed for fast,
effective character creation. Each template combines skills,
proficiencies, and starting gear into a coherent package focused on a
specific play style—combat, social interaction, technical expertise, or
exploration. Templates work across genres with minor adaptations,
providing flexible foundations for any setting.</p>
<p>This chapter provides 12 templates organized by focus area. Each
template includes skills, proficiencies, starting gear, genre variants,
and example characters. Use templates when you need a mechanically sound
character quickly, or mix elements from multiple templates to create
hybrid builds.</p>
<p>For skills and proficiencies, see Mechanics Reference Guide Chapters
06-17. For archetypes organized by genre, see Chapter 04. For backstory
development, see Chapter 06.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use Templates</h2>
<p>Templates serve two purposes:</p>
<p><strong>Complete Packages</strong>: Choose a template, note the
skills and proficiencies, select starting gear, and begin play. The
template provides everything needed for mechanical competence.</p>
<p><strong>Mix-and-Match Components</strong>: Select skills from one
template, proficiencies from another, and gear from a third. Templates
are modular—use them as building blocks rather than rigid
frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Genre Adaptation</strong>: Each template includes genre
variants showing how to adjust skills and gear for different settings. A
Frontline Fighter in Fantasy becomes a Marine in Sci-Fi with minimal
changes.</p>
<p><strong>Customization</strong>: Swap one or two skills to reflect
character backstory or unique talents. Adjust proficiencies to match
campaign needs. Templates provide structure, not limitation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="combat-templates">Combat-Focused Templates</h2>

character, backstory, hooks, motivation] —</p>
<h1 id="chapter-06">Chapter 06: Backstories and Hooks</h1>
<p>Characters are more than skills and proficiencies. They are people
shaped by pasts, driven by desires, haunted by failures, and defined by
relationships. A compelling backstory gives characters depth, provides
narrative hooks for GMs, and creates investment in the story.</p>
<p>This chapter provides tools for creating rich character histories
quickly or developing them deeply. It includes backstory templates,
quick hooks organized by genre, and personality tables for defining
motivations, flaws, and quirks. Use these tools to create characters who
feel real, relatable, and ready to grow.</p>
<p>For archetypes and mechanical templates, see Chapters 04-05. For
integrating backstories into campaign arcs, see GM Toolkit Chapter 04
(Character Arcs).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use This Chapter</h2>
<p>Backstory creation operates at two levels:</p>
<p><strong>Quick Hooks</strong>: One-sentence narrative seeds that
provide immediate character motivation and GM integration points. Roll
or choose a hook, note it on your character sheet, and begin play.
Develop details during gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Development</strong>: Full backstory templates with
motivations, secrets, relationships, and integration hooks. Use these
when you want a richly detailed character history before play begins, or
develop them during downtime between sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Creation</strong>: Share backstory elements
with your GM before play. GMs can weave backstories into campaigns,
create NPC connections, and design story arcs that resonate with
character histories.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution During Play</strong>: Backstories are not static.
Characters grow, discover new truths, and redefine themselves through
play. Update backstories as characters change.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="backstory-templates">Backstory Templates</h2>
<p>Templates provide narrative frameworks organized by common character
archetypes. Each template includes motivations (what drives the
character), secrets (hidden truths), relationships (connections to world
and party), genre variants, and integration hooks for GMs.</p>

caught in conspiracy or disaster; forced to fight for survival -

erupted; became de facto leader or defender</p>
<p><strong>Integration Hooks</strong>: - The campaign offers
opportunities to return to normal life—test whether you take them - Your
dependent or the person you left behind reappears in danger - You
discover hidden strengths or destiny you could not have imagined - The
party faces a crisis where your reluctant perspective saves everyone</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: <strong>Finn Greenfield</strong> (Cozy) — A
baker who agreed to help organize the village festival when the usual
organizer fell ill. The festival grew into a regional event, and now
Finn coordinates dozens of volunteers, manages budgets, and negotiates
with merchants. He just wanted to bake pies, but he is good at this—and
people are counting on him. He keeps a secret emergency recipe card in
his pocket for stress relief.</p>

on. Zara is a former assassin fleeing the guild that trained her after

not decided which fate is worse.</p>

predicted disappearance. She carries a journal filled with notes,
sketches, and dates that terrify her.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="backstory-survivor">Survivor of Trauma</h3>

from the trauma and reclaiming agency - <strong>Prevention</strong>:

help - The perpetrator reappears, forcing confrontation - Your trauma
gives you unique insight that helps solve a crisis</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="backstory-inheritor">Inheritor of Legacy</h3>

the legacy and proving worthy - <strong>Rebellion</strong>: Rejecting

<h2 id="integration-development">Integration and Development</h2>
<p>Backstories are most powerful when integrated into gameplay:</p>
<p><strong>Share with Your GM</strong>: Provide your backstory to the GM
before or during Session Zero. GMs can weave backstories into campaigns,
create meaningful NPCs, and design arcs that resonate with character
histories.</p>
<p><strong>Create Party Connections</strong>: Discuss backstories with
other players. Establish relationships, shared history, or complementary
motivations that tie the party together narratively.</p>
<p><strong>Update During Play</strong>: Characters grow through
experience. Update your backstory as you learn new truths, form new
relationships, or redefine yourself. Add notes about significant events,
changed beliefs, or resolved conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Use Downtime</strong>: Develop backstory elements during
downtime between adventures. Write letters, visit family, research
mysteries, or pursue personal goals. Backstory is not just past—it is
ongoing character life.</p>
<p><strong>Create Narrative Hooks</strong>: Give your GM tools to engage
your character. Include NPCs who might reappear, unresolved conflicts
that could escalate, or mysteries that drive investigation. Backstories
provide fuel for future stories.</p>

Ch. 08 (Fantasy), Ch. 09 (Horror/Mystery), Ch. 10 (Modern), Ch. 11
(Sci-Fi)</p>
<h3 id="pc-step-3">Step 3: Select Proficiencies</h3>
<p><strong>From Archetype or Template</strong> (Chapters 20-21): - Note
the 2-3 proficiencies from your archetype - Review proficiency effects
in Mechanics Reference Chapters 13-17</p>
<p><strong>Template Option</strong> (Chapter 21): - Choose a template
kit (Combat, Social, Technical, Exploration) - Use template
proficiencies if they fit better than archetype defaults</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Reference</strong>: Mechanics Reference Ch. 13 (Cozy),
Ch. 14 (Fantasy), Ch. 15 (Horror/Mystery), Ch. 16 (Modern), Ch. 17
(Sci-Fi)</p>
<h3 id="pc-step-4">Step 4: Choose Starting Gear</h3>
<p><strong>From Archetype</strong> (Chapter 20): - Note starting gear
listed in archetype entry - Add genre-appropriate equipment based on
concept</p>
<p><strong>From Template Kit</strong> (Chapter 21): - If using a
template, note the detailed gear list provided - Templates offer more
comprehensive equipment selections</p>
<p><strong>GM Approval</strong>: Confirm unusual or expensive items with
your GM</p>
<h3 id="pc-step-5">Step 5: Develop Backstory</h3>
<p><strong>Backstory Hook</strong> (Chapter 20): - Start with the hook
provided in your archetype - Expand with personal details and
history</p>

template that resonates (Orphan, Disgraced Professional, Reluctant Hero,
etc.) - Add motivations, secrets, and relationships</p>

library for immediate play integration - Connect backstory to campaign
and other PCs</p>
<h3 id="pc-step-6">Step 6: Finalize Stats and Details</h3>
<p><strong>Mechanical Review</strong>: - Confirm all skills and
proficiencies are noted - Verify starting gear is appropriate for power
level - Note any special abilities from proficiencies</p>
<p><strong>Character Details</strong>: - Name, appearance, personality
traits - Connections to other PCs or world - Character goals and
motivations</p>

Creation), Ch. 19 (Character Creation Overview)</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="quick-tips">Quick Tips for Players</h2>
<p><strong>Start with Fiction</strong>: Begin with who your character
is, not their stats. Identity drives mechanics, not the other way
around.</p>
<p><strong>Party Integration</strong>: Create at least one relationship
or shared connection with another PC during character creation.</p>
<p><strong>Leave Hooks</strong>: Build unresolved mysteries, important
relationships, or ongoing quests into your backstory. Give your GM
problems to resolve, not perfect heroes with nothing to prove.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Coherence</strong>: When someone reads your skill
list, they should understand who your character is without reading the
backstory.</p>
<p><strong>Genre Appropriateness</strong>: Ensure skills, proficiencies,
and gear match your campaign’s genre and tone.</p>
