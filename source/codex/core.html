    <header id="welcome-to-the-game">
      <h1>1. Welcome to the Game</h1>
      <p>
        This Core Rulebook is the single source of truth for the system. It explains how to create characters,
        how to resolve uncertain moments, and how to build stories together across many different genres. You do
        not need to memorize the entire book before you play. You only need to know where to look when questions
        arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules are written with a fiction first mindset. The story comes first. Mechanics support the story
        when the outcome of an action is uncertain and meaningful. When the outcome is clear, you simply describe
        what happens and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This game is built for cooperative play. The table is a creative team. Players bring characters to life.
        The Game Master presents the world, its challenges, and its opportunities. The rules help everyone answer
        a single question together: what happens next?
      </p>
      <p>
        The chapters that follow will introduce the core concepts, show you how to use this book, and guide you
        through creating your first character. Later sections deepen the rules and provide tools for long running
        campaigns, solo journeys, and shared authority play.
      </p>
    </header>

    <!-- Chapter 2 -->
    <section id="core-concepts-at-a-glance">
      <h2>2. Core Concepts at a Glance</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter introduces the most important ideas in the system in a compact form. Later chapters expand
        and refine them, but everything begins here. You can return to these concepts whenever you need to realign
        on how the game is meant to feel at the table.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-fiction-first">Fiction First</h3>
      <p>
        The story is always the starting point. You begin by understanding the situation, describing what the
        characters do, and only then reaching for rules if the outcome is uncertain and meaningful. You do not
        start with a rule and then try to force the fiction to match it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-characters">Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Characters are the main lens through which you experience the world. They are defined by four Attributes
        (Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Presence (PRE), Reason (RSN)), a small set of Skills, a focused group of Proficiencies, and the
        choices they make. Characters also have histories, goals, and unresolved threads that tie them to the
        world.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-checks-outcomes">Checks and Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        A Check is the system's way of resolving uncertainty when the stakes matter. When you make a Check, you
        use an Attribute, a Skill, and the shared fiction to determine what is at risk. The result produces an
        outcome tier, which becomes the next beat in the story. Success, partial success, and failure are all
        ways for the story to move forward.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-tags-conditions-clocks">Tags, Conditions, and Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions are short descriptors that shape how the world and characters behave. Tags are applied
        to scenes, locations, or situations. Conditions are ongoing states on characters. Clocks are visual
        trackers of danger, opportunity, or change. Together they help the table feel the weight of time and
        consequence.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-table-collaboration">Table Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        The system assumes that everyone at the table contributes to the story. The GM presents the world
        honestly. Players act through their characters with clear intent and approach. The rules help resolve
        what happens when those actions encounter uncertainty or resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can begin play after reading Chapters 1 through 6. The rest of the book deepens and extends the core
        ideas as your table needs them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 3 -->
    <section id="how-to-use-this-rulebook">
      <h2 id="how-to-use-this-rulebook-heading">3. How to Use This Rulebook</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter explains how to navigate the Core Rulebook, how to understand the structure of the system,
        and how to use the text at the table. You do not need to memorize everything before you begin play. The
        book is designed so that you can learn the basics, then return to specific chapters as questions arise.
      </p>

      <h3 id="navigating-the-book">Navigating the Book</h3>

      <p>
        The Core Rulebook is organized to support both reading and quick reference. The structure is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chapters 1 through 5</strong> introduce the game, the core concepts, how to use the book, the principles of play, and the different ways to play.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 6 through 13</strong> present the core rules that players will use most often at the table, including character creation, attributes, and core resolution.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 14 through 17</strong> provide the full Skills and Proficiencies references.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 18 through 20</strong> collect key mechanical references such as Tags, Conditions, and advancement.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 21 through 26</strong> give the Game Master tools for running scenes, campaigns, and alternative modes of play.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 27 and 28</strong> provide the glossary and index.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are new to tabletop roleplaying, it is helpful to read Chapters 1 through 5 in order. If you
        already have experience, you can skim the early chapters, then focus on Chapters 6 and 7, where the
        core resolution and character structure are introduced in detail.
      </p>

      <h3 id="rules-as-tools">Rules as Tools</h3>

      <p>
        The rules in this book are tools. They help the table answer the question of what happens next. You do
        not exist to serve the rules. The rules exist to support your story. When a rule clarifies a moment, use
        it. When a rule does not add anything useful, resolve the situation through conversation instead. The
        game is at its best when the rules and the fiction work together.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system is built around a single resolution structure. Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks all connect to this structure. Once you understand how Checks work, the rest of
        the mechanics will feel familiar and consistent.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The group reaches a sealed laboratory door. The GM describes the control panel and the faint glow
        of backup power. The players discuss how their characters might open it. No one grabs dice yet. The
        table first decides whether the action is risky and meaningful. Only then do the rules become
        necessary.
      </div>

      <h3 id="what-a-rule-explains">What a Rule Explains</h3>

      <p>
        Every major rule in this book answers three questions. What does this rule cover. When does it
        apply. How does it influence the fiction. These three ideas appear in the way chapters are written
        and in the examples that follow them. If a rule feels confusing, return to these questions. They
        usually point to the intended use.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fiction-first-structure">Fiction First Structure</h3>

      <p>
        The rules always follow the fiction. You begin by understanding the situation, the environment, and
        the characters. You describe what is happening in the story. Only when the outcome of an action is
        uncertain and meaningful do you reach for mechanics. You do not start with a rule and then try to
        force the fiction to match it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="checks-in-context">Checks in Context</h3>

      <p>
        Checks are the system's way of resolving uncertainty. Later chapters explain the procedure in
        detail. This chapter focuses on how to think about Checks as you read. A Check is a signal that the
        scene has reached a point where chance and consequence matter. When a Check is called for, the
        chapter you are reading will explain exactly which part of the system is in focus.
      </p>

      <h3 id="learning-the-flow">Learning the Flow of the System</h3>

      <p>
        The system has a flow that you will learn over time. You do not need to master everything at once.
        Instead, you can approach the book in layers. First, read enough to understand the core loop. Then,
        as your group encounters new situations, you can read or reread the chapters that support those
        scenes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="intent-and-approach-in-the-text">Intent and Approach in the Text</h3>

      <p>
        As you read rule examples, notice how often the words intent and approach appear. They are used
        deliberately. Intent describes what the character wants to achieve. Approach describes how the
        character is trying to achieve it. Many examples in this book use that pairing to show why certain
        Attributes, Skills, or Proficiencies apply.
      </p>

      <h3 id="recognizing-rule-triggers">Recognizing Rule Triggers</h3>

      <p>
        Not every scene needs mechanical resolution. One of the skills you develop as you read and play is
        the ability to recognize which moments call for specific rules. When the story reaches a point where
        uncertainty and consequence align, a rule triggers. A chapter might say that a certain kind of
        situation often triggers a Check, or that a specific type of danger often advances a Clock.
      </p>

      <h3 id="using-examples">Using Examples</h3>

      <p>
        Examples appear throughout this book to demonstrate the rules in action. They follow a consistent
        pattern. The scene is described. A player states intent and approach. The GM decides whether a Check
        is needed. Dice are rolled. The outcome changes the situation. The example then shows how that
        change affects the next moment of the story.
      </p>

      <h3 id="using-the-glossary">Using the Glossary</h3>

      <p>
        The glossary at the end of the book is the authoritative source for terms. When a word has a
        glossary definition, it will appear with a link the first time it is used in a chapter. If you are
        uncertain about the meaning of a term, check the glossary entry. It often clears up confusion that
        might arise from casual reading.
      </p>

      <h3 id="reading-as-a-group">Reading as a Group</h3>

      <p>
        Many groups benefit from reading the early chapters together. A session zero that includes a shared
        read through of the welcome, core concepts, and principles of play chapters helps everyone align on
        tone and expectations. Chapter 5, Ways to Play the Game, is also useful to read as a group so that
        everyone understands which play style you are aiming for.
      </p>

      <h3 id="chapter-3-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>

      <p>
        This chapter has given you a lens for reading the rest of the book. Treat the rules as tools that
        support your story. Let the fiction guide when mechanics come into play. Use examples and the
        glossary to deepen your understanding. Move at a pace that feels comfortable. The next chapter
        introduces the core principles of play that shape every session at your table.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <section id="core-principles-of-play">
      <h2 id="core-principles-of-play-heading">4. Core Principles of Play</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter explains the principles that shape every session of the game. These principles guide how
        players describe actions, how the GM presents situations, and how the table works together to move the
        story forward. They are not rules in the mechanical sense. They are values and habits that help the
        system produce consistent and engaging play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game uses a fiction first approach. You begin with the situation, decide what the characters do,
        and let the rules support the story when uncertainty and consequence appear. The principles below help
        the table maintain that flow.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-table-creative-team">The Table Is a Creative Team</h3>
      <p>
        Every player at the table is part of the creative process. The GM presents the world. Players bring
        characters to life. The conversation between them becomes the engine of play. No one person controls
        the story. The table builds it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM describes locations, events, and pressures. Players respond by stating what their characters
        attempt. When the situation contains meaningful risk, the rules support the moment. In scenes that are
        calm or certain, the group continues the story through simple narration.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The GM describes a run down depot on the outskirts of a coastal town. A player says their character
        wants to scout the area quietly. Another player suggests checking the rail lines for signs of use. The
        GM listens, considers what is true about this place, and describes what those actions reveal. No rule
        is required yet. The table is building the fiction through conversation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-intent">Player Intent Drives Action</h3>
      <p>
        A player states what their character wants to accomplish. This is intent. They then explain how their
        character attempts it. This is approach. The GM uses intent and approach to decide whether the action
        succeeds automatically or whether risk is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intent focuses the scene. Approach shapes which Attributes, Skills, or Proficiencies may apply. The
        rules always interpret a character's attempt in the context of the fiction, not as a puzzle of
        modifiers.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-gm-honesty">The GM Presents the World Honestly</h3>
      <p>
        The GM is responsible for portraying the world clearly and fairly. This means describing situations
        honestly, sharing sensory details, and revealing information that the characters would reasonably
        perceive. The GM does not use surprises to punish the players. Instead, surprises serve the fiction and
        come from established threats or incomplete information.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Insight</strong>
        Honesty does not mean revealing every detail. It means playing the world as it is, not as a tool to
        control the players. Present danger when danger exists. Present opportunity when opportunity exists.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-fiction-first-mechanics-second">Fiction First, Mechanics Second</h3>
      <p>
        Mechanics never replace the shared imagination of the table. Instead, they provide structure when the
        story reaches a point of risk or uncertainty. If no risk exists, the GM simply narrates the outcome of
        the player's action. This keeps the pace smooth and avoids unnecessary rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain, the stakes matter to the story, and
        failure or partial success would move the scene forward in an interesting way.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-failure-momentum">Failure Creates Momentum</h3>
      <p>
        Failure is not an end point. It is a change in direction. When a Check fails, the story moves forward
        into a new state. This might introduce complications, new dangers, or shifts in position. Failure
        should never stop the story. It should bend it.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A character tries to leap across a narrow canal. The Check fails. The GM does not say the character
        falls into the water and nothing more happens. Instead, the GM describes how the character grabs a
        rusted ladder, swings against the wall, and attracts the attention of guards nearby. The failure adds
        motion to the scene.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-partial-success">Partial Success Is a Core Story Beat</h3>
      <p>
        Partial success provides a result that sits between success and failure. The character achieves part of
        what they intended, but not all of it, or they succeed with a cost. This outcome creates tension,
        opportunity, and interesting decisions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-gm-describes-outcomes">The GM Describes Outcomes, Not Numbers</h3>
      <p>
        The players roll dice. The GM interprets the results in the fiction. A number never appears without
        narrative meaning. The GM describes what the dice reveal. The story changes in ways that make sense in
        the scene.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-agency">Player Agency Comes From Clear Choices</h3>
      <p>
        Agency in this system comes from informed decision making. The GM describes situations in enough detail
        that players can understand what is at stake and choose their actions freely. When the stakes are clear,
        Checks feel meaningful and satisfying.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-world-responds">The World Responds to Character Action</h3>
      <p>
        Every action changes the situation. When the players act, the GM updates the fiction. Threats advance.
        Opportunities emerge. Characters alter their position, their resources, or their standing with others.
        The world is not static. It reacts.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A character tries to convince a merchant to delay a shipment. The Check is a partial success. The
        merchant agrees to a delay, but only if the character promises to return a personal favor. The world
        changes. The favor becomes a new thread in the story.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-ownership">Respect for Player Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        Players own their characters. They express their thoughts, motivations, and actions. The GM does not
        decide how a character feels or what a character chooses. The GM presents the world. Players choose how
        their characters engage with it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-scenes-direction">Scenes Have Direction</h3>
      <p>
        A good scene moves toward something. Sometimes this is an objective. Sometimes it is a revelation.
        Sometimes it is a moment of tension or a decision. The GM frames scenes with purpose. Players act with
        intent. Checks provide turning points.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-trust">Trust at the Table</h3>
      <p>
        Trust supports everything. The GM trusts players to act with the fiction in mind. Players trust the GM
        to run the world honestly. The table trusts the system to provide structure when necessary. This trust
        allows everyone to play boldly.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The principles in this chapter describe how the table works together. The GM presents the world
        honestly. Players express intent and approach. The fiction leads. Mechanics support. Failure creates
        momentum. Partial success adds tension. The world responds. Scenes have direction. Trust holds
        everything in place. The next chapter expands on these principles by showing how different modes of play
        shape the experience of the system.

      <h2 id="ways-to-play-the-game-heading">5. Ways to Play the Game</h2>

      <p>
        This game supports multiple styles of play. Some groups meet weekly around a table. Others play online
        in short sessions. Some prefer a single player experience. Others use a shared world without a
        designated Game Master. The system is flexible and does not assume one standard format. The rules in
        later chapters work for all modes of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chapter gives an overview of each play style. It also points to the sections of the book that
        support them. You do not need to choose one style forever. Many groups switch between modes depending on
        who is available or what kind of story they want to tell.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-group-play-gm">Group Play With a GM</h3>
      <p>
        A group gathers with one person acting as Game Master. The GM presents the world, plays its characters,
        and describes the consequences of player actions. The players control their own characters and make
        decisions that drive the story forward.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-duet-play">Duet Play</h3>
      <p>
        Duet play involves one player and one GM. It feels more intimate and often focuses on personal stories
        or character driven arcs. Scenes can shift quickly. The pacing is flexible.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-gmless-cooperative">GMless Cooperative Play</h3>
      <p>
        In GMless play, the group shares narrative responsibility. No single person controls the world. Instead,
        the table uses procedures that rotate authority and help distribute scene framing, consequences, and
        world building. The game still uses the core resolution system, but each player takes turns providing
        challenges or interpreting outcomes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-solo-play">Solo Play</h3>
      <p>
        Solo play is designed for a single player. The player controls one or more characters and uses
        structured tools to emulate the world. These tools include prompts, oracles, and scene framing
        procedures. Solo play keeps the core mechanics intact.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-asynchronous">Asynchronous and Play by Post</h3>
      <p>
        Asynchronous play occurs through messages, email, shared documents, or online platforms. Players take
        turns responding when they have time. Because asynchronous play lacks immediate conversation, clarity
        is essential. Players describe intent and approach carefully. The GM presents outcomes with enough
        detail to move the story forward between posts.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-one-shot-sessions">One Shot Sessions</h3>
      <p>
        A one shot is a complete adventure played in a single session. These sessions help introduce new
        players to the system and work well for conventions or special events. One shots focus on clear stakes
        and strong pacing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-campaign-play">Campaign Play</h3>
      <p>
        A campaign is a longer story told over multiple sessions. Campaigns grow through character development,
        evolving threats, and unfolding consequences. The GM builds on player actions and uses tools like
        Clocks and Tags to maintain continuity.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-hybrid-styles">Hybrid Styles</h3>
      <p>
        Many tables blend modes. Some groups use solo play between sessions to develop character arcs. Others
        rotate GMless scenes inside a GM led campaign. Some begin with a one shot and transition into a long
        form campaign. The system supports these transitions without additional rules.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-choosing-mode">Choosing the Right Mode</h3>
      <p>
        There is no single correct way to play. Each mode offers a different experience. Choose group play for
        shared storytelling and dynamic character interaction. Choose duet play for intimate stories. Choose
        GMless for collaborative world building. Choose solo play for personal exploration. Choose asynchronous
        play for flexible schedules. Choose one shots for quick adventures. Choose campaigns for deep, evolving
        narratives.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This chapter described the supported modes of play. The system works whether you have one player or six,
        whether you have a GM or distribute authority, and whether you play in person or through messages. The
        next chapter introduces the character framework that supports all of these play styles.

      <h2 id="character-creation-heading">6. Character Creation</h2>

      <p>
        Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a
        concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that
        reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule
        before you start. This chapter guides you step by step and tells you when to reference later chapters
        for details.
      </p>

      <h3 id="character-creation-learning-by-example">Learning by Example</h3>
      <p>
        Some players prefer to see a full character before reading detailed steps. If you want to follow a
        character build from start to finish, you can skip ahead to the example character later in this chapter
        and return to each step as needed.
      </p>

      <h3 id="character-creation-flow">The Creation Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Character Creation follows a clear sequence. You begin with story driven questions, then add mechanical
        structure, then return to fiction to finalize your concept. Each step builds on the previous one.

      </ol>

      <h3 id="step-one-choose-a-concept">Step One: Choose a Concept</h3>
      <p>
        Every character begins with a concept. A concept is the short answer to the question, who is this
        person. It is the foundation for every choice you make later in the process. The concept does not depend
        on mechanics. It does not require a long backstory. It is a clean expression of identity, role, and
        theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for
        discovery. A concept like retired scout with a guilty conscience offers a clearer direction than simply
        fighter. The first concept suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world. The
        second is mostly a job title.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A player chooses the concept former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message
        patterns. This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours,
        delicate tools, and unanswered questions.
      </div>

      <p>
        Your concept should tell you what kind of scenes you want to be in, what skills you might have learned,
        and what challenges might matter to you. If you feel stuck, talk with the GM and the other players. The
        group can help you find a concept that fits the tone of the campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-two-core-identity-elements">Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Identity elements are the personal details that give your character depth. They are the details that
        help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at
        once. The goal is to add enough information that the character feels real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Useful identity elements include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name and pronouns</li>
        <li>Origin or home environment</li>
        <li>Everyday role or profession before the story begins</li>
        <li>Notable habits and mannerisms</li>
        <li>First impressions and social style</li>
        <li>One or two key experiences that shaped them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These details are most helpful when they connect to your concept. If your concept involves quiet work
        and technical skill, identity elements that reflect that focus will make the character feel grounded.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement
        built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes
        are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.
      </div>

      <p>
        You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character.
        For now, capture the parts that feel most important.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-three-assign-attributes">Step Three: Assign Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character tends to
        approach challenges when there is no time to prepare a careful strategy. Attributes are not personality
        traits. They are expressions of how your character acts when the moment demands action.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system uses four Attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Might (MIG)</strong>: Physical strength, force, and raw endurance.</li>
        <li><strong>Agility (AGI)</strong>: Balance, coordination, stealth, and quick reaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence (PRE)</strong>: Social force, confidence, emotional expression, and leadership.</li>
        <li><strong>Reason (RSN)</strong>: Logic, analysis, memory, and structured thinking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        New characters begin with the following Attribute spread.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One Attribute at 2</li>
        <li>Two Attributes at 1</li>
        <li>One Attribute at 0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability. Characters
        begin competent but not exceptional in every area. As the campaign progresses, advancement rules will
        allow Attributes to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assign these values based on your concept and identity elements. Ask yourself which Attribute your
        character relies on most often, which areas they find challenging, and which weaknesses might create
        interesting story moments.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella is analytical and steady. Her player chooses Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0. This
        emphasizes her careful thinking, modest coordination, quiet presence, and relative physical weakness.
      </div>

      <h3 id="before-skills-proficiencies">Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        This system does not rely on a fixed or exhaustive list of Skills or Proficiencies. The rulebook
        provides examples and frameworks, but players are encouraged to work with their GM to define custom
        entries that reflect their character's experiences, training, and background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills and Proficiencies serve different purposes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Skills</strong> are action based competencies. They are used directly in Checks when your character attempts something under pressure or uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Proficiencies</strong> are narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines that your character understands well and that shape how the GM interprets the fiction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Open lists and collaboration allow the system to support many different genres and character concepts
        without requiring constant balance adjustments. Because the resolution system and advantage rules keep
        extremes in check, creative choices stay within a stable range.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM has final approval over the scope of any custom Skill or Proficiency. A good entry is grounded in
        the setting, clear in purpose, and neither so broad that it covers everything nor so narrow that it
        rarely matters.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-four-choose-skills">Step Four: Choose Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Skills represent learned abilities and practiced competencies. They describe what your character has
        done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. Skills connect directly to action. When your
        character makes a Check, a Skill often shapes their approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills answer the question, what have you practiced enough to apply under stress. They cover actions
        such as moving quietly, reading a room, patching an injury, climbing, or analyzing a pattern. Skills are
        usually written as verbs or verb like phrases.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, choose a small set of Skills that reflect your concept and background. These
        are the actions your character knows how to perform with some confidence. Later chapters describe
        Skills in more detail and provide example lists grouped by Attribute.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses
        the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions
        she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels.
      </div>

      <p>
        You do not need to optimize your Skills. The best choices are the ones that support the kinds of scenes
        you want to experience. If your group plans to focus on investigation, travel, or social tension, choose
        Skills that will shine in those situations.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-five-choose-proficiencies">Step Five: Choose Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Proficiencies represent narrower areas of expertise that influence how the GM interprets the fiction.
        They describe tools, technologies, environments, or disciplines that your character understands deeply.
        Proficiencies often do not require a roll at all. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is
        obvious, or how serious a risk feels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proficiencies answer the question, what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly. They
        often appear as nouns or domain labels, such as medical tools, survey equipment, or small boat
        navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, choose a small number of Proficiencies that grow naturally out of your
        concept and background. Work with the GM to make sure each Proficiency has a clear scope and fits the
        setting.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the
        Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands
        the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.
      </div>

      <p>
        Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they influence difficulty, consequences, and
        access to information. A character with the correct Proficiency may identify a hazard more quickly,
        avoid an unnecessary roll, or reduce the severity of a complication.
      </p>

     <h3 id="step-six-starting-gear">Step Six: Determine Starting Gear</h3> <p> Your character begins play with a small set of equipment that fits their background, reflects their concept, and supports the type of stories they are about to enter. Gear does not provide numerical bonuses. It provides narrative capability, fictional positioning, and a sense of grounded reality. </p> <p> Starting gear should feel personal and practical. It represents what your character already knows how to use. It also helps the GM understand what kind of situations your character is prepared for. </p> <h4>Basic Gear Package</h4> <p>New characters begin with the following items:</p> <ul> <li>Clothing suited to their environment</li> <li>A backpack or satchel</li> <li>Basic travel supplies</li> <li>A personal item that holds meaning</li> </ul> <p> These are the essentials that allow any character to operate in the world. </p> <h4>Concept Driven Gear</h4> <p> In addition to the basic gear, each character chooses up to three items that reflect their background or profession. These items help define who they were before the story begins. They also give the GM material to work with when shaping scenes. </p> <p>Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>A well used toolkit</li> <li>A compact field journal</li> <li>A collection of reference notes</li> <li>A handmade navigation compass</li> <li>A signal mirror</li> <li>A small medical pouch</li> <li>A set of precision tools</li> <li>A reliable lantern</li> <li>A simple musical instrument</li> <li>A deck of analysis cards</li> <li>A set of rope and climbing spikes</li> </ul> <p> These items should feel directly connected to your concept and identity. </p> <div class="example"> <strong>Example</strong> Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work. </div> <h4>Tools and Equipment as Fictional Authority</h4> <p> Gear provides fictional authority. If your character carries the right tools for a task, the GM may: </p> <ul> <li>Lower difficulty</li> <li>Remove uncertainty</li> <li>Change the stakes</li> <li>Provide clearer approaches</li> </ul> <p> Gear does not guarantee success. It enables meaningful choices and supports your character’s expertise. </p> <p> If the character does not have suitable gear, the GM might increase difficulty or introduce complications. Gear matters most when the environment or situation is demanding. </p> <h4>Weapons and Dangerous Tools</h4> <p> If the campaign tone allows for weapons or hazardous tools, characters may begin with one simple item that fits their concept. This might be: </p> <ul> <li>A pocket knife</li> <li>A small baton</li> <li>A bow with a few arrows</li> <li>A sturdy multi tool</li> <li>A simple sidearm, if the genre supports it</li> </ul> <p> Weapons should be grounded in the fiction of your setting. They are not meant to be superior mechanical objects. They are narrative tools that help shape how your character approaches risk. </p> <p> If your world does not include weapons or includes them only sparingly, this section may be reduced or removed based on GM preference. </p> <h4>Custom Gear</h4> <p> The player and GM may collaborate to create custom gear that supports the concept. The item should be: </p> <ul> <li>Clear in purpose</li> <li>Grounded in the setting</li> <li>Useful in scenes</li> <li>Not mechanically overwhelming</li> </ul> <p> Good custom gear is memorable and unique without dominating the story. </p>

      <h3 id="step-seven-background-relationships">Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        Every character comes from somewhere. They have lived a life before the story begins. They have
        connections, memories, challenges, and unfinished business. Establishing background and relationships
        gives the character emotional depth and provides the GM with narrative tools that will enrich scenes,
        challenges, and future arcs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Background should answer simple questions about where you grew up, what kind of work you used to do,
        which pressures shaped you, and who influenced your habits. You do not need a long timeline. Focus on
        the few details that explain your current self.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were
        spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. The steady routine and quiet
        tension of relay work shaped her temperament and made her comfortable with long stretches of focused
        attention.
      </div>

      <p>
        In addition to background, define one or two meaningful relationships. These might be mentors, rivals,
        family members, coworkers, or friends. The relationship does not need to be fully detailed. It only
        needs to be important enough that it might matter later.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing.
        Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods. The disagreement left tension
        that has never been resolved.
      </div>

      <p>
        Background and relationships help the GM tie your character into the world. They can inspire early
        scenes, recurring NPCs, and long term arcs.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-eight-goals-drives-threads">Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads</h3>
      <p>
        A character becomes compelling when they want something and when something inside them remains
        unresolved. Goals and drives shape decisions during play. Personal threads give the GM material for
        future stories. Together, these elements reveal why your character keeps moving, what they fear, and
        what they hope to become.
      </p>
      <p>
        A goal is a concrete outcome your character wants to achieve. Good goals are specific enough to guide
        choices, matter to your character, and can change over time.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella sets a clear goal. She wants to discover the source and meaning of a coded message fragment that
        once caused a relay overload in her station. The event was never fully explained. She believes it points
        to something larger.
      </div>

      <p>
        A drive is an internal force that shapes how your character approaches situations. Drives can be
        emotional, practical, or philosophical. They create consistent patterns of behavior.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella's drive is to understand patterns. She is drawn to puzzles and systems that reward careful
        observation. When the group faces a choice between rushing in and studying a problem, this drive pushes
        her toward analysis.
      </div>

      <p>
        A personal thread is an unresolved element from your character's past or inner life. It might be a
        lingering question, a strained relationship, or a memory that will not sit still. Threads give the GM a
        reason to bring parts of your past into the present.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella keeps a fragment of the dangerous coded message in her notebook. The pattern returns to her
        thoughts at odd moments. She cannot explain why it feels important. This becomes her personal thread.
      </div>

      <p>
        Goals create direction. Drives create consistency. Threads create emotional connection. Together, they
        give your character a shape that will matter throughout the campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-nine-final-review">Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have chosen Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background details, relationships, goals,
        drives, and personal threads, it is time to review the character as a whole. This step ensures that your
        character is coherent, playable, and aligned with the tone and structure of the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look back over your choices. Ask whether your Skills and Proficiencies reflect your background, whether
        your goals and drives connect to your history, and whether your gear matches your life so far. Adjust
        anything that feels mismatched.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are building characters as a group, talk about how your characters fit together. Consider how
        personalities might complement or clash, which roles each character may fill in the story, and what
        binds the group in the opening scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, work with the GM to clarify how your character enters the first session. This might be a place
        they are traveling to, a task they are trying to complete, or a rumor they are following. A short
        starting statement gives the GM a concrete way to bring you into the initial situation.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella begins the campaign traveling the canyon relay route. She has heard that a nearby outpost recently
        picked up a fragment of code that resembles the pattern in her notebook. She arrives curious, cautious,
        and ready to follow any trace of that signal.
      </div>

      <h3 id="example-character-rella">Example Character Build: Rella</h3>
      <p>
        The following example walks through all steps from concept to final review. It is not a template you
        must follow. It is a demonstration of how the pieces can fit together.
      </p>

      <h4>Concept and Identity</h4>
      <p>
        Rella is a former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message patterns. She grew up
        in a canyon settlement built around a relay hub. She is quiet, analytical, and prefers to listen before
        she speaks. Her clothing is practical and layered. She carries a worn satchel and a small insulated
        lantern.
      </p>

      <h4>Attributes</h4>
      <p>
        Rella's player assigns Attributes using the standard array.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Might (MIG) 0</li>
        <li>Agility (AGI) 1</li>
        <li>Presence (PRE) 1</li>
        <li>Reason (RSN) 2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This reinforces her thoughtful, physically modest, steady presence.
      </p>

      <h4>Skills</h4>
      <p>
        Rella's Skills reflect actions she has practiced repeatedly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Observation</li>
        <li>Stealth</li>
        <li>Technical Work</li>
        <li>Machinery Handling</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These Skills support careful investigation, quiet movement, and hands on repair work.
      </p>

      <h4>Proficiencies</h4>
      <p>
        Rella's Proficiencies capture her deeper technical experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Telegraph Instruments</li>
        <li>Precision Tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These Proficiencies tell the GM that she understands communication devices and finely made tools well
        enough to use them safely and creatively.
      </p>

      <h4>Gear</h4>
      <p>
        Rella begins with sturdy work clothes, a travel satchel, a compact tool roll, basic rations, a small
        insulated lantern, a notebook filled with cipher fragments, and her first message pattern sheet as a
        keepsake.
      </p>

      <h4>Background and Relationships</h4>
      <p>
        Rella's background is rooted in the canyon relay network. She learned her trade from Isten, a coworker
        who valued speed over caution. Their disagreement about a risky repair ended their working
        relationship. That tension remains in Rella's memory.
      </p>

      <h4>Goals, Drives, and Threads</h4>
      <p>
        Rella's goal is to discover the source and meaning of a dangerous coded message that once caused a
        relay overload. Her drive is to understand patterns. Her personal thread is the fragment of code that
        she carries and cannot quite forget.
      </p>

      <h4>Starting Position</h4>
      <p>
        Rella enters the campaign along the relay route, following rumors of a similar signal discovered at a
        nearby outpost. She arrives with purpose, uncertainty, and enough tools to handle her work.

      <h3 id="character-creation-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and
        contributes to the story. You determine who your character is, what they can do, what they know well,
        what they carry, where they come from, what they want, and why they keep moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        A completed character has a coherent concept, clear identity elements, assigned Attributes, focused
        Skills, meaningful Proficiencies, practical gear, a grounded background, important relationships, a
        goal, a drive, and at least one unresolved thread. They also have a place in the group and a reason to
        step into the opening scene of the campaign.
