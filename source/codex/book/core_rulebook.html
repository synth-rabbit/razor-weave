    <section id="part-i-foundations" class="part-intro">
      <h1>Part I: Foundations</h1>
      <p>
        Part I introduces the core ideas of the game: what it is about, how to read and use this rulebook, and
        how to build characters who feel grounded in the world. These chapters define Attributes, Actions,
        Checks, Tags, Conditions, Clocks, and the overall flow of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of Part I, you should understand how to create a character, how to resolve uncertainty at the
        table, how combat, exploration, and social scenes work, and how to collaborate with your group and GM to
        tell stories together.
      </p>
    </section>
    <header id="ch-01-welcome-to-the-game">
      <h1 id="welcome-to-the-game">1. Welcome to the Game</h1>
      <p>
        This Core Rulebook is the single source of truth for the system. It explains how to create characters,
        how to resolve uncertain moments, and how to build stories together across many different genres. You do
        not need to memorize the entire book before you play. You only need to know where to look when questions
        arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules are written with a fiction first mindset. The story comes first. Mechanics support the story
        when the outcome of an action is uncertain and meaningful. When the outcome is clear, you simply describe
        what happens and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This game is built for cooperative play. The table is a creative team. Players bring characters to life.
        The Game Master presents the world, its challenges, and its opportunities. The rules help everyone answer
        a single question together: what happens next?
      </p>
      <p>
        The chapters that follow will introduce the core concepts, show you how to use this book, and guide you
        through creating your first character. Later sections deepen the rules and provide tools for long running
        campaigns, solo journeys, and shared authority play.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section id="ch-02-core-concepts">
      <h2 id="core-concepts-at-a-glance-heading">2. Core Concepts at a Glance</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter introduces the most important ideas in the system in a compact form. Later chapters expand
        and refine them, but everything begins here. You can return to these concepts whenever you need to realign
        on how the game is meant to feel at the table.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-fiction-first">Fiction First</h3>
      <p>
        The story is always the starting point. You begin by understanding the situation, describing what the
        characters do, and only then reaching for rules if the outcome is uncertain and meaningful. You do not
        start with a rule and then try to force the fiction to match it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-characters">Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Characters are the main lens through which you experience the world. They are defined by four Attributes
        (Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Presence (PRE), Reason (RSN)), a small set of Skills, a focused group of Proficiencies, and the
        choices they make. Characters also have histories, goals, and unresolved threads that tie them to the
        world.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-checks-outcomes">Checks and Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        A Check is the system's way of resolving uncertainty when the stakes matter. When you make a Check, you
        use an Attribute, a Skill, and the shared fiction to determine what is at risk. The result produces an
        outcome tier, which becomes the next beat in the story. Success, partial success, and failure are all
        ways for the story to move forward.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-tags-conditions-clocks">Tags, Conditions, and Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions are short descriptors that shape how the world and characters behave. Tags are applied
        to scenes, locations, or situations. Conditions are ongoing states on characters. Clocks are visual
        trackers of danger, opportunity, or change. Together they help the table feel the weight of time and
        consequence.
      </p>
      <h3 id="core-concepts-table-collaboration">Table Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        The system assumes that everyone at the table contributes to the story. The GM presents the world
        honestly. Players act through their characters with clear intent and approach. The rules help resolve
        what happens when those actions encounter uncertainty or resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can begin play after reading Chapters 1 through 6. The rest of the book deepens and extends the core
        ideas as your table needs them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-03-how-to-use-this-rulebook">
      <h2 id="how-to-use-this-rulebook-heading">3. How to Use This Rulebook</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter explains how to navigate the Core Rulebook, how to understand the structure of the system,
        and how to use the text at the table. You do not need to memorize everything before you begin play. The
        book is designed so that you can learn the basics, then return to specific chapters as questions arise.
      </p>

      <h3 id="navigating-the-book">Navigating the Book</h3>

      <p>
        The Core Rulebook is organized to support both reading and quick reference. The structure is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chapters 1 through 5</strong> introduce the game, the core concepts, how to use the book, the principles of play, and the different ways to play.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 6 through 13</strong> present the core rules that players will use most often at the table, including character creation, attributes, and core resolution.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 14 through 17</strong> provide the full Skills and Proficiencies references.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 18 through 20</strong> collect key mechanical references such as Tags, Conditions, and advancement.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 21 through 26</strong> give the Game Master tools for running scenes, campaigns, and alternative modes of play.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapters 27 and 28</strong> provide the glossary and index.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are new to tabletop roleplaying, it is helpful to read Chapters 1 through 5 in order. If you
        already have experience, you can skim the early chapters, then focus on Chapters 6 and 7, where the
        core resolution and character structure are introduced in detail.
      </p>

      <h3 id="rules-as-tools">Rules as Tools</h3>

      <p>
        The rules in this book are tools. They help the table answer the question of what happens next. You do
        not exist to serve the rules. The rules exist to support your story. When a rule clarifies a moment, use
        it. When a rule does not add anything useful, resolve the situation through conversation instead. The
        game is at its best when the rules and the fiction work together.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system is built around a single resolution structure. Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags,
        Conditions, and Clocks all connect to this structure. Once you understand how Checks work, the rest of
        the mechanics will feel familiar and consistent.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The group reaches a sealed laboratory door. The GM describes the control panel and the faint glow
        of backup power. The players discuss how their characters might open it. No one grabs dice yet. The
        table first decides whether the action is risky and meaningful. Only then do the rules become
        necessary.
      </div>

      <h3 id="what-a-rule-explains">What a Rule Explains</h3>

      <p>
        Every major rule in this book answers three questions. What does this rule cover. When does it
        apply. How does it influence the fiction. These three ideas appear in the way chapters are written
        and in the examples that follow them. If a rule feels confusing, return to these questions. They
        usually point to the intended use.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fiction-first-structure">Fiction First Structure</h3>

      <p>
        The rules always follow the fiction. You begin by understanding the situation, the environment, and
        the characters. You describe what is happening in the story. Only when the outcome of an action is
        uncertain and meaningful do you reach for mechanics. You do not start with a rule and then try to
        force the fiction to match it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="checks-in-context">Checks in Context</h3>

      <p>
        Checks are the system's way of resolving uncertainty. Later chapters explain the procedure in
        detail. This chapter focuses on how to think about Checks as you read. A Check is a signal that the
        scene has reached a point where chance and consequence matter. When a Check is called for, the
        chapter you are reading will explain exactly which part of the system is in focus.
      </p>

      <h3 id="learning-the-flow">Learning the Flow of the System</h3>

      <p>
        The system has a flow that you will learn over time. You do not need to master everything at once.
        Instead, you can approach the book in layers. First, read enough to understand the core loop. Then,
        as your group encounters new situations, you can read or reread the chapters that support those
        scenes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="intent-and-approach-in-the-text">Intent and Approach in the Text</h3>

      <p>
        As you read rule examples, notice how often the words intent and approach appear. They are used
        deliberately. Intent describes what the character wants to achieve. Approach describes how the
        character is trying to achieve it. Many examples in this book use that pairing to show why certain
        Attributes, Skills, or Proficiencies apply.
      </p>

      <h3 id="recognizing-rule-triggers">Recognizing Rule Triggers</h3>

      <p>
        Not every scene needs mechanical resolution. One of the skills you develop as you read and play is
        the ability to recognize which moments call for specific rules. When the story reaches a point where
        uncertainty and consequence align, a rule triggers. A chapter might say that a certain kind of
        situation often triggers a Check, or that a specific type of danger often advances a Clock.
      </p>

      <h3 id="using-examples">Using Examples</h3>

      <p>
        Examples appear throughout this book to demonstrate the rules in action. They follow a consistent
        pattern. The scene is described. A player states intent and approach. The GM decides whether a Check
        is needed. Dice are rolled. The outcome changes the situation. The example then shows how that
        change affects the next moment of the story.
      </p>

      <h3 id="using-the-glossary">Using the Glossary</h3>

      <p>
        The glossary at the end of the book is the authoritative source for terms. When a word has a
        glossary definition, it will appear with a link the first time it is used in a chapter. If you are
        uncertain about the meaning of a term, check the glossary entry. It often clears up confusion that
        might arise from casual reading.
      </p>

      <h3 id="reading-as-a-group">Reading as a Group</h3>

      <p>
        Many groups benefit from reading the early chapters together. A session zero that includes a shared
        read through of the welcome, core concepts, and principles of play chapters helps everyone align on
        tone and expectations. Chapter 5, Ways to Play the Game, is also useful to read as a group so that
        everyone understands which play style you are aiming for.
      </p>

      <h3 id="chapter-3-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>

      <p>
        This chapter has given you a lens for reading the rest of the book. Treat the rules as tools that
        support your story. Let the fiction guide when mechanics come into play. Use examples and the
        glossary to deepen your understanding. Move at a pace that feels comfortable. The next chapter
        introduces the core principles of play that shape every session at your table.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-04-core-principles-of-play">
      <h2 id="core-principles-of-play-heading">4. Core Principles of Play</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter explains the principles that shape every session of the game. These principles guide how
        players describe actions, how the GM presents situations, and how the table works together to move the
        story forward. They are not rules in the mechanical sense. They are values and habits that help the
        system produce consistent and engaging play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game uses a fiction first approach. You begin with the situation, decide what the characters do,
        and let the rules support the story when uncertainty and consequence appear. The principles below help
        the table maintain that flow.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-table-creative-team">The Table Is a Creative Team</h3>
      <p>
        Every player at the table is part of the creative process. The GM presents the world. Players bring
        characters to life. The conversation between them becomes the engine of play. No one person controls
        the story. The table builds it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM describes locations, events, and pressures. Players respond by stating what their characters
        attempt. When the situation contains meaningful risk, the rules support the moment. In scenes that are
        calm or certain, the group continues the story through simple narration.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The GM describes a run down depot on the outskirts of a coastal town. A player says their character
        wants to scout the area quietly. Another player suggests checking the rail lines for signs of use. The
        GM listens, considers what is true about this place, and describes what those actions reveal. No rule
        is required yet. The table is building the fiction through conversation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-intent">Player Intent Drives Action</h3>
      <p>
        A player states what their character wants to accomplish. This is intent. They then explain how their
        character attempts it. This is approach. The GM uses intent and approach to decide whether the action
        succeeds automatically or whether risk is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intent focuses the scene. Approach shapes which Attributes, Skills, or Proficiencies may apply. The
        rules always interpret a character's attempt in the context of the fiction, not as a puzzle of
        modifiers.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-gm-honesty">The GM Presents the World Honestly</h3>
      <p>
        The GM is responsible for portraying the world clearly and fairly. This means describing situations
        honestly, sharing sensory details, and revealing information that the characters would reasonably
        perceive. The GM does not use surprises to punish the players. Instead, surprises serve the fiction and
        come from established threats or incomplete information.
      </p>

        Honesty does not mean revealing every detail. It means playing the world as it is, not as a tool to
        control the players. Present danger when danger exists. Present opportunity when opportunity exists.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-fiction-first-mechanics-second">Fiction First, Mechanics Second</h3>
      <p>
        Mechanics never replace the shared imagination of the table. Instead, they provide structure when the
        story reaches a point of risk or uncertainty. If no risk exists, the GM simply narrates the outcome of
        the player's action. This keeps the pace smooth and avoids unnecessary rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain, the stakes matter to the story, and
        failure or partial success would move the scene forward in an interesting way.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-failure-momentum">Failure Creates Momentum</h3>
      <p>
        Failure is not an end point. It is a change in direction. When a Check fails, the story moves forward
        into a new state. This might introduce complications, new dangers, or shifts in position. Failure
        should never stop the story. It should bend it.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A character tries to leap across a narrow canal. The Check fails. The GM does not say the character
        falls into the water and nothing more happens. Instead, the GM describes how the character grabs a
        rusted ladder, swings against the wall, and attracts the attention of guards nearby. The failure adds
        motion to the scene.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-partial-success">Partial Success Is a Core Story Beat</h3>
      <p>
        Partial success provides a result that sits between success and failure. The character achieves part of
        what they intended, but not all of it, or they succeed with a cost. This outcome creates tension,
        opportunity, and interesting decisions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-gm-describes-outcomes">The GM Describes Outcomes, Not Numbers</h3>
      <p>
        The players roll dice. The GM interprets the results in the fiction. A number never appears without
        narrative meaning. The GM describes what the dice reveal. The story changes in ways that make sense in
        the scene.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-agency">Player Agency Comes From Clear Choices</h3>
      <p>
        Agency in this system comes from informed decision making. The GM describes situations in enough detail
        that players can understand what is at stake and choose their actions freely. When the stakes are clear,
        Checks feel meaningful and satisfying.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-world-responds">The World Responds to Character Action</h3>
      <p>
        Every action changes the situation. When the players act, the GM updates the fiction. Threats advance.
        Opportunities emerge. Characters alter their position, their resources, or their standing with others.
        The world is not static. It reacts.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A character tries to convince a merchant to delay a shipment. The Check is a partial success. The
        merchant agrees to a delay, but only if the character promises to return a personal favor. The world
        changes. The favor becomes a new thread in the story.
      </div>

      <h3 id="core-principles-player-ownership">Respect for Player Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        Players own their characters. They express their thoughts, motivations, and actions. The GM does not
        decide how a character feels or what a character chooses. The GM presents the world. Players choose how
        their characters engage with it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-scenes-direction">Scenes Have Direction</h3>
      <p>
        A good scene moves toward something. Sometimes this is an objective. Sometimes it is a revelation.
        Sometimes it is a moment of tension or a decision. The GM frames scenes with purpose. Players act with
        intent. Checks provide turning points.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-trust">Trust at the Table</h3>
      <p>
        Trust supports everything. The GM trusts players to act with the fiction in mind. Players trust the GM
        to run the world honestly. The table trusts the system to provide structure when necessary. This trust
        allows everyone to play boldly.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-principles-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The principles in this chapter describe how the table works together. The GM presents the world
        honestly. Players express intent and approach. The fiction leads. Mechanics support. Failure creates
        momentum. Partial success adds tension. The world responds. Scenes have direction. Trust holds
        everything in place. The next chapter expands on these principles by showing how different modes of play
        shape the experience of the system.

    <section id="ch-05-ways-to-play">
      <h2 id="ways-to-play-the-game-heading">5. Ways to Play the Game</h2>

      <p>
        This game supports multiple styles of play. Some groups meet weekly around a table. Others play online
        in short sessions. Some prefer a single player experience. Others use a shared world without a
        designated Game Master. The system is flexible and does not assume one standard format. The rules in
        later chapters work for all modes of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chapter gives an overview of each play style. It also points to the sections of the book that
        support them. You do not need to choose one style forever. Many groups switch between modes depending on
        who is available or what kind of story they want to tell.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-group-play-gm">Group Play With a GM</h3>
      <p>
        A group gathers with one person acting as Game Master. The GM presents the world, plays its characters,
        and describes the consequences of player actions. The players control their own characters and make
        decisions that drive the story forward.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-duet-play">Duet Play</h3>
      <p>
        Duet play involves one player and one GM. It feels more intimate and often focuses on personal stories
        or character driven arcs. Scenes can shift quickly. The pacing is flexible.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-gmless-cooperative">GMless Cooperative Play</h3>
      <p>
        In GMless play, the group shares narrative responsibility. No single person controls the world. Instead,
        the table uses procedures that rotate authority and help distribute scene framing, consequences, and
        world building. The game still uses the core resolution system, but each player takes turns providing
        challenges or interpreting outcomes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-solo-play">Solo Play</h3>
      <p>
        Solo play is designed for a single player. The player controls one or more characters and uses
        structured tools to emulate the world. These tools include prompts, oracles, and scene framing
        procedures. Solo play keeps the core mechanics intact.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-asynchronous">Asynchronous and Play by Post</h3>
      <p>
        Asynchronous play occurs through messages, email, shared documents, or online platforms. Players take
        turns responding when they have time. Because asynchronous play lacks immediate conversation, clarity
        is essential. Players describe intent and approach carefully. The GM presents outcomes with enough
        detail to move the story forward between posts.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-one-shot-sessions">One Shot Sessions</h3>
      <p>
        A one shot is a complete adventure played in a single session. These sessions help introduce new
        players to the system and work well for conventions or special events. One shots focus on clear stakes
        and strong pacing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-campaign-play">Campaign Play</h3>
      <p>
        A campaign is a longer story told over multiple sessions. Campaigns grow through character development,
        evolving threats, and unfolding consequences. The GM builds on player actions and uses tools like
        Clocks and Tags to maintain continuity.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-hybrid-styles">Hybrid Styles</h3>
      <p>
        Many tables blend modes. Some groups use solo play between sessions to develop character arcs. Others
        rotate GMless scenes inside a GM led campaign. Some begin with a one shot and transition into a long
        form campaign. The system supports these transitions without additional rules.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-choosing-mode">Choosing the Right Mode</h3>
      <p>
        There is no single correct way to play. Each mode offers a different experience. Choose group play for
        shared storytelling and dynamic character interaction. Choose duet play for intimate stories. Choose
        GMless for collaborative world building. Choose solo play for personal exploration. Choose asynchronous
        play for flexible schedules. Choose one shots for quick adventures. Choose campaigns for deep, evolving
        narratives.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ways-to-play-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This chapter described the supported modes of play. The system works whether you have one player or six,
        whether you have a GM or distribute authority, and whether you play in person or through messages. The
        next chapter introduces the character framework that supports all of these play styles.
      </p>

    <section id="ch-06-character-creation">
      <h2 id="character-creation-heading">6. Character Creation</h2>

      <p>
        Character Creation is the process of turning an idea into a fully playable character. You begin with a
        concept, shape it through narrative and mechanical choices, and finish with a complete sheet that
        reflects who your character is and how they participate in the world. You do not need to know every rule
        before you start. This chapter guides you step by step and tells you when to reference later chapters
        for details.
      </p>

      <h3 id="character-creation-learning-by-example">Learning by Example</h3>
      <p>
        Some players prefer to see a full character before reading detailed steps. If you want to follow a
        character build from start to finish, you can skip ahead to the example character later in this chapter
        and return to each step as needed.
      </p>

      <h3 id="character-creation-flow">The Creation Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Character Creation follows a clear sequence. You begin with story driven questions, then add mechanical
        structure, then return to fiction to finalize your concept. Each step builds on the previous one.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Step One: Choose a Concept</li>
        <li>Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements</li>
        <li>Step Three: Assign Attributes</li>
        <li>Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies</li>

        <li>Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads</li>
        <li>Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="step-one-choose-a-concept">Step One: Choose a Concept</h3>
      <p>
        Every character begins with a concept. A concept is the short answer to the question, who is this
        person. It is the foundation for every choice you make later in the process. The concept does not depend
        on mechanics. It does not require a long backstory. It is a clean expression of identity, role, and
        theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strong concepts are specific enough to suggest habits and history, but open enough to leave room for
        discovery. A concept like retired scout with a guilty conscience offers a clearer direction than simply
        fighter. The first concept suggests relationships, regrets, and a way of moving through the world. The
        second is mostly a job title.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        A player chooses the concept former telegraph engineer who searches for meaning in strange message
        patterns. This concept suggests a quiet, technical character whose life has been shaped by long hours,
        delicate tools, and unanswered questions.
      </div>

      <p>
        Your concept should tell you what kind of scenes you want to be in, what skills you might have learned,
        and what challenges might matter to you. If you feel stuck, talk with the GM and the other players. The
        group can help you find a concept that fits the tone of the campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-two-core-identity-elements">Step Two: Define Core Identity Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Identity elements are the personal details that give your character depth. They are the details that
        help you imagine how your character thinks, speaks, and reacts. You do not need to define everything at
        once. The goal is to add enough information that the character feels real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Useful identity elements include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name and pronouns</li>
        <li>Origin or home environment</li>
        <li>Everyday role or profession before the story begins</li>
        <li>Notable habits and mannerisms</li>
        <li>First impressions and social style</li>
        <li>One or two key experiences that shaped them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These details are most helpful when they connect to your concept. If your concept involves quiet work
        and technical skill, identity elements that reflect that focus will make the character feel grounded.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        The telegraph engineer concept becomes a character named Rella. She grew up in a narrow canyon settlement
        built around a relay hub. She is quiet, observant, and prefers to think before she speaks. Her clothes
        are practical and layered. Her hands are steady from years of fine repair work.
      </div>

      <p>
        You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths about your character.
        For now, capture the parts that feel most important.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-three-assign-attributes">Step Three: Assign Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes describe your character's natural capabilities. They reflect how your character tends to
        approach challenges when there is no time to prepare a careful strategy. Attributes are not personality
        traits. They are expressions of how your character acts when the moment demands action.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system uses four Attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Might (MIG)</strong>: Physical strength, force, and raw endurance.</li>
        <li><strong>Agility (AGI)</strong>: Balance, coordination, stealth, and quick reaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence (PRE)</strong>: Social force, confidence, emotional expression, and leadership.</li>
        <li><strong>Reason (RSN)</strong>: Logic, analysis, memory, and structured thinking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        New characters begin with the following Attribute spread.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One Attribute at 2</li>
        <li>Two Attributes at 1</li>
        <li>One Attribute at 0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No Attribute may be negative during creation. This spread represents balanced capability. Characters
        begin competent but not exceptional in every area. As the campaign progresses, advancement rules will
        allow Attributes to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assign these values based on your concept and identity elements. Ask yourself which Attribute your
        character relies on most often, which areas they find challenging, and which weaknesses might create
        interesting story moments.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella is analytical and steady. Her player chooses Reason 2, Agility 1, Presence 1, Might 0. This
        emphasizes her careful thinking, modest coordination, quiet presence, and relative physical weakness.
      </div>

      <h3 id="before-skills-proficiencies">Before You Choose Skills and Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        This system does not rely on a fixed or exhaustive list of Skills or Proficiencies. The rulebook
        provides examples and frameworks, but players are encouraged to work with their GM to define custom
        entries that reflect their character's experiences, training, and background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills and Proficiencies serve different purposes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Skills</strong> are action based competencies. They are used directly in Checks when your character attempts something under pressure or uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Proficiencies</strong> are narrow domains of expertise. They describe tools, environments, or disciplines that your character understands well and that shape how the GM interprets the fiction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Open lists and collaboration allow the system to support many different genres and character concepts
        without requiring constant balance adjustments. Because the resolution system and advantage rules keep
        extremes in check, creative choices stay within a stable range.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM has final approval over the scope of any custom Skill or Proficiency. A good entry is grounded in
        the setting, clear in purpose, and neither so broad that it covers everything nor so narrow that it
        rarely matters.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-four-choose-skills">Step Four: Choose Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Skills represent learned abilities and practiced competencies. They describe what your character has
        done often enough to rely on in uncertain moments. Skills connect directly to action. When your
        character makes a Check, a Skill often shapes their approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills answer the question, what have you practiced enough to apply under stress. They cover actions
        such as moving quietly, reading a room, patching an injury, climbing, or analyzing a pattern. Skills are
        usually written as verbs or verb like phrases.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, choose a small set of Skills that reflect your concept and background. These
        are the actions your character knows how to perform with some confidence. Later chapters describe
        Skills in more detail and provide example lists grouped by Attribute.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella's life has involved careful observation, technical upkeep, and quiet movement. Her player chooses
        the Skills Observation, Stealth, Technical Work, and Machinery Handling. These Skills reflect actions
        she has performed many times in relay stations and narrow maintenance tunnels.
      </div>

      <p>
        You do not need to optimize your Skills. The best choices are the ones that support the kinds of scenes
        you want to experience. If your group plans to focus on investigation, travel, or social tension, choose
        Skills that will shine in those situations.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-five-choose-proficiencies">Step Five: Choose Proficiencies</h3>
      <p>
        Proficiencies represent narrower areas of expertise that influence how the GM interprets the fiction.
        They describe tools, technologies, environments, or disciplines that your character understands deeply.
        Proficiencies often do not require a roll at all. Instead, they change what is reasonable, what is
        obvious, or how serious a risk feels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proficiencies answer the question, what have you studied or handled enough to use responsibly. They
        often appear as nouns or domain labels, such as medical tools, survey equipment, or small boat
        navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, choose a small number of Proficiencies that grow naturally out of your
        concept and background. Work with the GM to make sure each Proficiency has a clear scope and fits the
        setting.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella learned to keep delicate instruments working in harsh conditions. Her player chooses the
        Proficiencies Telegraph Instruments and Precision Tools. These Proficiencies signal that she understands
        the internal workings of communication devices better than the average person.
      </div>

      <p>
        Proficiencies do not add numbers to Checks. Instead, they influence difficulty, consequences, and
        access to information. A character with the correct Proficiency may identify a hazard more quickly,
        avoid an unnecessary roll, or reduce the severity of a complication.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-six-starting-gear">Step Six: Determine Starting Gear</h3>
      <p>
        Your character begins play with a small set of equipment that fits their background, reflects their
        concept, and supports the type of stories they are about to enter. Gear does not provide numerical
        bonuses. It provides narrative capability, fictional positioning, and a sense of grounded reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting gear should feel personal and practical. It represents what your character already knows how
        to use. It also helps the GM understand what kind of situations your character is prepared for.
      </p>

      <h4>Basic Gear Package</h4>
      <p>New characters begin with the following items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clothing suited to their environment</li>
        <li>A backpack or satchel</li>
        <li>Basic travel supplies</li>
        <li>A personal item that holds meaning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are the essentials that allow any character to operate in the world.
      </p>

      <h4>Concept Driven Gear</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to the basic gear, each character chooses up to three items that reflect their background or
        profession. These items help define who they were before the story begins. They also give the GM material
        to work with when shaping scenes.
      </p>
      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A well used toolkit</li>
        <li>A compact field journal</li>
        <li>A collection of reference notes</li>
        <li>A handmade navigation compass</li>
        <li>A signal mirror</li>
        <li>A small medical pouch</li>
        <li>A set of precision tools</li>
        <li>A reliable lantern</li>
        <li>A simple musical instrument</li>
        <li>A deck of analysis cards</li>
        <li>A set of rope and climbing spikes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These items should feel directly connected to your concept and identity.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella begins with a travel satchel, a compact set of communication tools, a notebook filled with cipher
        fragments, and a small insulated lantern used for nighttime relay work.
      </div>

      <h4>Tools and Equipment as Fictional Authority</h4>
      <p>
        Gear provides fictional authority. If your character carries the right tools for a task, the GM may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower difficulty</li>
        <li>Remove uncertainty</li>
        <li>Change the stakes</li>
        <li>Provide clearer approaches</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Gear does not guarantee success. It enables meaningful choices and supports your character’s expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the character does not have suitable gear, the GM might increase difficulty or introduce
        complications. Gear matters most when the environment or situation is demanding.
      </p>

      <h4>Weapons and Dangerous Tools</h4>
      <p>
        If the campaign tone allows for weapons or hazardous tools, characters may begin with one simple item
        that fits their concept. This might be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A pocket knife</li>
        <li>A small baton</li>
        <li>A bow with a few arrows</li>
        <li>A sturdy multi tool</li>
        <li>A simple sidearm, if the genre supports it</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Weapons should be grounded in the fiction of your setting. They are not meant to be superior mechanical
        objects. They are narrative tools that help shape how your character approaches risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your world does not include weapons or includes them only sparingly, this section may be reduced or
        removed based on GM preference.
      </p>

      <h4>Custom Gear</h4>
      <p>
        The player and GM may collaborate to create custom gear that supports the concept. The item should be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear in purpose</li>
        <li>Grounded in the setting</li>
        <li>Useful in scenes</li>
        <li>Not mechanically overwhelming</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Good custom gear is memorable and unique without dominating the story.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-seven-background-relationships">Step Seven: Establish Background and Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        Every character comes from somewhere. They have lived a life before the story begins. They have
        connections, memories, challenges, and unfinished business. Establishing background and relationships
        gives the character emotional depth and provides the GM with narrative tools that will enrich scenes,
        challenges, and future arcs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Background should answer simple questions about where you grew up, what kind of work you used to do,
        which pressures shaped you, and who influenced your habits. You do not need a long timeline. Focus on
        the few details that explain your current self.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella grew up near a canyon relay hub, listening to coded traffic echo along the wires. Her days were
        spent checking connections, cleaning contacts, and logging patterns. The steady routine and quiet
        tension of relay work shaped her temperament and made her comfortable with long stretches of focused
        attention.
      </div>

      <p>
        In addition to background, define one or two meaningful relationships. These might be mentors, rivals,
        family members, coworkers, or friends. The relationship does not need to be fully detailed. It only
        needs to be important enough that it might matter later.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella names a former coworker, Isten, who taught her how to keep unstable relay junctions from failing.
        Their relationship ended after an argument about unsafe repair methods. The disagreement left tension
        that has never been resolved.
      </div>

      <p>
        You do not need to define every relationship up front. Leave space for new connections to emerge in
        play. When a new NPC feels important, you can add them to your relationship list.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-eight-goals-drives-threads">Step Eight: Define Goals, Drives, and Personal Threads</h3>
      <p>
        Goals and drives explain why your character keeps moving. They are the internal pressures that shape
        choices and responses. A goal is something concrete your character wants to achieve. A drive is a deeper
        motivation or fear that pushes them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal threads are unresolved elements in your character's life. They might be unanswered questions,
        unfulfilled promises, or lingering tensions. These threads give the GM material to weave into future
        scenes.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example</strong>
        Rella has a goal to decode an anomalous pattern she once intercepted and a drive to avoid causing harm
        through her work. A personal thread involves the mysterious origin of the pattern and who might have
        sent it.
      </div>

      <p>
        Try to define at least one short-term goal, one long-term goal, and one or two personal threads. You can
        always revise these as the story unfolds.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-nine-final-review">Step Nine: Final Review and Campaign Fit</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have completed the previous steps, review your character as a whole. Ask whether the concept,
        identity elements, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, goals, and
        threads feel like parts of the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talk with the GM and other players about how your character fits into the campaign. Look for natural
        connections, shared history, or complementary goals. Adjust details where needed so that the group feels
        like a cohesive cast.
      </p>

      <h3 id="example-character-rella">Example Character Build: Rella</h3>

        This section presents Rella as a complete example character, summarizing the choices made in each step.

      <h3 id="character-creation-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the
        campaign. By moving from concept to identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background,
        relationships, and goals, you build a character who feels grounded and ready for play. Later chapters
        explain how these elements interact with the core mechanics during sessions.

    <section id="ch-07-characters-and-attributes">
      <h2 id="characters-and-attributes-heading">7. Characters and Attributes</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter deepens the character framework introduced in Character Creation. It explains how
        Attributes define what your character is naturally good at, how those ratings interact with intent and
        approach, and how to think about Attribute growth over time. Skills and Proficiencies add texture and
        specialization. Attributes provide the core pillars those details rest on.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attributes-overview">Attributes Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Every character has four Attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Might (MIG)</strong> – Physical power, endurance, and resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Agility (AGI)</strong> – Speed, precision, balance, and reflexes.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence (PRE)</strong> – Charisma, willpower, and social influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Reason (RSN)</strong> – Logic, perception, memory, and analytical thinking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Attribute ratings are small numbers that reflect how strongly each pillar shows up in play. During
        Character Creation, you assign a starting spread (usually 2, 1, 1, 0) across MIG, AGI, PRE, and RSN.
        Those ratings are then added to relevant checks throughout the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attributes are always interpreted through the fiction. A high MIG character does not simply “have +2.”
        They push through heavy doors, endure long marches, and soak physical hardship more easily. A high RSN
        character spots patterns, recalls obscure details, and notices when something does not fit.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attribute-ratings-and-meaning">Attribute Ratings and What They Mean</h3>
      <p>
        Attribute ratings are intentionally compact. Most characters begin with values between 0 and 2. This
        keeps the focus on intent, approach, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, Conditions, and the `4d6` dice
        results instead of on large numerical bonuses.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general guideline:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0</strong> – Unremarkable. You can attempt normal tasks with no special edge or penalty.</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> – Competent. You are noticeably capable in this area compared to an average person.</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> – Exceptional. You stand out in most situations that rely on this Attribute.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you make a Check, you roll <strong>4d6</strong>, sum the dice, and add your Attribute rating (and
        any other bonuses or penalties). You compare that total against a Difficulty Class (DC) from the
        standard ladder (typically DC 12–22). The difference between your total and the DC is the margin, which
        determines the outcome tier. A higher Attribute nudges those margins upward without guaranteeing any
        particular result.
      </p>

      <h3 id="choosing-your-starting-spread">Choosing Your Starting Spread</h3>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, you assign a small array of values across your four Attributes. The default
        array is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One Attribute at <strong>2</strong></li>
        <li>Two Attributes at <strong>1</strong></li>
        <li>One Attribute at <strong>0</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This spread creates characters who are competent across several areas with a clear primary strength and
        one relative weakness. You can think of this as your character’s natural “starting shape” before Skills,
        Proficiencies, Tags, and gear are layered on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A useful way to choose your spread is to ask three questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which Attribute describes how you most often solve problems when under pressure?</li>
        <li>Which Attribute fits your concept but should remain a supporting strength rather than your main focus?</li>
        <li>Which Attribute would be interesting to struggle with?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Answering these questions usually reveals where to place your 2, your two 1s, and your 0. You are not
        optimizing a build—you are deciding what kind of situations will feel natural, challenging, or risky for
        this character.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attributes-and-archetypes">Attributes and Archetypes</h3>
      <p>
        Different spreads suggest different kinds of characters. The table below offers a few example archetypes.
        You do not need to use these labels at the table—they are here to help you think about possibilities.
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>Example Attribute Spreads and Archetypes</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Spread</th>
            <th>Example Archetype</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>MIG 2, AGI 1, PRE 1, RSN 0</td>
            <td>Front-line problem solver</td>
            <td>Leads with physical action and presence; relies on others for deep analysis.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MIG 0, AGI 2, PRE 1, RSN 1</td>
            <td>Scout or infiltrator</td>
            <td>Excels at movement and precision; must negotiate around brute-force obstacles.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MIG 1, AGI 0, PRE 2, RSN 1</td>
            <td>Negotiator or leader</td>
            <td>Strong in social scenes; needs help when delicate physical work is required.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MIG 1, AGI 1, PRE 0, RSN 2</td>
            <td>Analyst or investigator</td>
            <td>Solves problems through observation and planning; may struggle to command a room.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Use these examples as prompts, not prescriptions. You can apply any spread to any concept. A physically
        powerful scholar or a socially adept scout can be just as compelling as the “expected” combinations.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attributes-intent-approach">Attributes, Intent, and Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes are chosen based on <em>how</em> your character attempts something, not on what they would
        like to roll. The GM listens to your intent (what you are trying to achieve) and your approach (how you
        attempt it), then chooses the Attribute that best matches that description.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same fictional goal can be resolved with different Attributes depending on approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prying open a stuck hatch with brute force might call for <strong>MIG</strong>.</li>
        <li>Picking the lock or working delicate mechanisms might call for <strong>AGI</strong>.</li>
        <li>Coaxing someone on the other side to open it might call for <strong>PRE</strong>.</li>
        <li>Analyzing the structure to find a weak point might call for <strong>RSN</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This flexibility keeps Attributes tied to the story. You do not choose an Attribute from a menu. You
        describe what your character does. The Attribute follows naturally from that description.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Calling for an Attribute</strong>
        When a player describes intent and approach, repeat back what you heard in your own words, then say
        which Attribute you think applies and why. If the table disagrees, adjust together. The goal is shared
        understanding, not surprise rulings. If two Attributes seem equally valid, choose the one that fits the
        character’s established habits, or offer the player a choice with different risks attached.
      </div>

      <h3 id="working-with-low-attributes">Working with Low Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        A rating of 0 is not a punishment. It means your character does not naturally lean on that Attribute
        when things get tense. The game expects you to have at least one area where you are merely ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Low Attributes shape the story in interesting ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A low MIG character might avoid direct contests of strength and instead look for tools, allies, or alternate routes.</li>
        <li>A low AGI character might favor careful planning over risky stunts.</li>
        <li>A low PRE character might rely on written communication, intermediaries, or quiet influence.</li>
        <li>A low RSN character might lean on intuition, experience, or other party members for analysis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Play your weaknesses honestly and creatively. They provide hooks for growth, tension, and teamwork.
        When a situation hinges on your low Attribute, it does not mean you should stay silent. It means the
        stakes are higher, and failure may reveal something important about who you are.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attribute-examples-by-attribute">Examples by Attribute</h3>

      <h4 id="attribute-mig">Might (MIG)</h4>
      <p>
        Might represents physical strength, raw effort, and bodily resilience. It appears whenever you forcefully
        move, lift, or endure something.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – MIG Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> A storm has washed out a small bridge. The group needs to move a heavy improvised
        plank into place before the river rises further.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> The GM calls for a MIG-based Check using <strong>4d6</strong> against DC 16 (Tough). The
        character with MIG 2 and the appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> On a full success, the plank is set and the group crosses safely. On a partial
        success, the plank holds but the character gains a Strained condition. On a failure, the plank slips,
        and the GM advances a flood Clock.
      </div>

      <h4 id="attribute-agi">Agility (AGI)</h4>
      <p>
        Agility covers balance, precision, and quick reactions. It appears when you dodge, climb, sneak, or
        operate fine mechanisms under pressure.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – AGI Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> A character sprints across slick rooftop tiles to reach a signal mast before an alarm
        spreads.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> The GM sets DC 18 (Hard) due to rain and height. The character with AGI 1 and a relevant
        Skill rolls `4d6+1`. A hazardous Tag on the roof may impose Disadvantage if the group ignored earlier
        warnings.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> On a full success, they reach the mast in time. On a partial success, they make
        it but leave evidence behind or trigger a lesser alarm. On a failure, they slip, and the GM ticks a
        danger Clock or applies a Condition such as Exposed or Dazed.
      </div>

      <h4 id="attribute-pre">Presence (PRE)</h4>
      <p>
        Presence governs social force, confidence, and emotional weight. It appears when you persuade, command,
        intimidate, or rally others.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – PRE Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> The group needs a nervous official to delay a shipment. A character steps forward to
        make the case.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> The GM sets DC 14 (Routine) if the request is modest, or higher if the stakes are severe.
        The character with PRE 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls `4d6+2`. Helpful Tags (Shared History) or
        Proficiencies (Bureaucratic Procedures) may grant Advantage.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> On a full success, the delay is granted cleanly. On a partial success, the delay
        comes with a favor owed or a complication. On a failure, the official refuses and alerts a rival faction.
      </div>

      <h4 id="attribute-rsn">Reason (RSN)</h4>
      <p>
        Reason covers analysis, pattern recognition, and careful observation. It appears when you investigate,
        deduce, plan, or notice hidden details.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – RSN Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> A character studies overlapping telegraph logs to determine whether a recent outage is
        natural or engineered.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> The GM sets DC 16 (Tough). The character with RSN 2 and an appropriate Skill rolls
        `4d6+2`. A relevant Proficiency (Telegraph Instruments) may lower the DC or reveal extra context on a
        success.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> On a full success, they identify the outage as deliberate and tie it to a specific
        region. On a partial success, they confirm it was engineered but only narrow the possibilities. On a
        failure, they misinterpret the data and the GM advances a faction Clock based on that error.
      </div>

      <h3 id="multi-attribute-actions-and-teamwork">Multi-Attribute Actions and Teamwork</h3>
      <p>
        Many scenes involve multiple characters and overlapping actions. Instead of treating every moment as a
        separate Check, think about how Attributes combine across the group.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One character might use MIG to hold a door while another uses RSN to bypass its lock.</li>
        <li>A PRE-focused character might draw attention so an AGI-focused ally can move unseen.</li>
        <li>Two characters with different strengths might both roll, with the table focusing on the more
          interesting result.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The GM decides whether each character rolls separately, one character rolls with assistance, or a single
        roll represents the group’s combined effort. Whichever option you choose, keep intent and approach in
        view. Assistance should make sense in the fiction, not just on the character sheet.
      </p>

      <h3 id="attribute-growth-preview">Attribute Growth Preview</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes do not change every session. They grow slowly across a campaign as characters reach important
        milestones, resolve personal threads, and survive significant consequences. Advancement rules appear in
        the Advancement and Long Term Growth chapter later in this book.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Attributes do increase, the change should feel meaningful in the fiction. A rise in MIG might come
        after a season of hard labor or survival in harsh conditions. A rise in RSN might follow extended study,
        investigative breakthroughs, or hard lessons learned from mistakes. Treat Attribute growth as an
        opportunity to reflect on how the character has changed, not just as a numerical upgrade.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Signaling Growth</strong>
        When a player increases an Attribute, ask them to describe one moment from the campaign that symbolizes
        that change. Then add a Tag to the world, a new relationship, or an updated detail on the character’s
        sheet that reflects their growth. This keeps advancement grounded in the shared story rather than only
        in numbers.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-08-actions-checks-outcomes">
      <h2 id="actions-checks-outcomes-heading">8. Actions, Checks, and Outcomes</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter describes the core resolution engine of the game. Whenever a character takes an action and
        the outcome is uncertain, consequential, and within their reach to influence, the table may call for a
        Check. Checks turn intent and approach into dice, and dice back into story beats. Understanding how to
        call for, perform, and interpret Checks is essential for both players and the GM.
      </p>

      <h3 id="when-to-roll-and-when-not-to">When to Roll (and When Not To)</h3>
      <p>
        You roll when the GM calls for a Check. The GM should only do this when three conditions are all true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal
          conditions does not roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Consequence</strong>: Failure or partial success would introduce tension, cost, or change. If failure just means
          “try again until it works,” do not roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Agency</strong>: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Do not roll for things entirely outside
          the characters’ control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If all three are present, a Check is appropriate. If one or more are missing, the GM either says “yes”
        and narrates success, or “no” and explains why it is impossible or out of scope. Checks are tools for
        focusing on interesting uncertainty, not a gate in front of every action.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – When to Roll</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is
        significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous.<br />
        <em>Assessment:</em> The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character’s choices
        matter. The GM calls for a Check.<br />
        <em>Counter‑example:</em> The same character crossing a sturdy bridge in calm weather does not roll.
        Success is assumed; the story moves forward.
      </div>

      <h3 id="the-core-check-procedure">The Core Check Procedure</h3>
      <p>
        Every Check follows the same basic loop:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The player declares intent and approach.</li>
        <li>The GM decides whether a Check is needed.</li>
        <li>If needed, the GM selects an Attribute and relevant Skill, sets a DC, and notes any Tags,
          Conditions, or Proficiencies that might grant Advantage or Disadvantage.</li>
        <li>The player rolls <strong>4d6</strong>, applies modifiers, and compares the total to the DC.</li>
        <li>The table interprets the outcome tier (critical success, full success, partial success, failure,
          critical failure) and updates the fiction accordingly.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="declaring-intent-and-approach">Declaring Intent and Approach</h3>
      <p>
        When you declare an action, you state two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intent</strong>: What you want to achieve in the fiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Approach</strong>: How you are trying to achieve it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Intent focuses the scene. Approach determines which Attribute, Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and
        Conditions are relevant. The more concrete and grounded your description, the easier it is for the GM to
        set an appropriate DC and for the group to picture the moment.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Intent and Approach</strong><br />
        <em>Intent:</em> “I want to get the factory foreman to delay shipment of the crates.”<br />
        <em>Approach:</em> “I speak with her in private, emphasize the safety risks, and show her evidence of the
        faulty wiring we found.”<br />
        The GM recognizes this as a PRE‑based approach with a relevant social Skill and possibly a Proficiency
        related to safety procedures or technical documentation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="setting-dcs">Setting DCs</h3>
      <p>
        The GM sets a Difficulty Class (DC) to represent how hard the task is under current circumstances. The
        system uses a standard ladder:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DC 12</strong> – Easy</li>
        <li><strong>DC 14</strong> – Routine</li>
        <li><strong>DC 16</strong> – Tough</li>
        <li><strong>DC 18</strong> – Hard</li>
        <li><strong>DC 20</strong> – Heroic</li>
        <li><strong>DC 22</strong> – Legendary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Start by imagining what success would look like in the scene and how far it is from effortless. Use
        lower DCs when characters have strong fictional positioning, good information, and safe conditions. Use
        higher DCs when time is short, the environment is hostile, or the task is at the edge of what is
        possible in the setting.
      </p>

      <h3 id="advantage-disadvantage-tags-conditions">Advantage, Disadvantage, Tags, and Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than constantly adjusting the DC, the game often represents favorable or unfavorable circumstances
        through Advantage and Disadvantage.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>+1 Advantage</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep the best 4.</li>
        <li><strong>+2 Advantage</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep the best 4.</li>
        <li><strong>-1 Disadvantage</strong>: Roll 5d6, keep the worst 4.</li>
        <li><strong>-2 Disadvantage</strong>: Roll 6d6, keep the worst 4.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Advantage and Disadvantage usually come from Tags, Conditions, environment, tools, Proficiencies, or
        prior setup actions. They represent the table’s shared sense that the character is favored or hindered in
        this moment. Multiple sources combine into a single level of Advantage or Disadvantage and are capped at
        ±2—several small edges do not create infinite Advantage, and multiple problems do not push you below −2.
        If a character would have both Advantage and Disadvantage, reduce them against each other (for example,
        +2 and −1 becomes +1) until only one side remains, then apply the final level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions described in earlier chapters provide a shared vocabulary for these modifiers:
        <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Slick</em>, or <em>Exposed</em> might impose Disadvantage; <em>Solid Cover</em>
        or <em>Marked</em> might grant Advantage in specific contexts or to specific parties.
      </p>

      <h3 id="rolling-4d6-and-calculating-margin">Rolling 4d6 and Calculating Margin</h3>
      <p>
        When a Check is called for, follow this procedure:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Roll <strong>4d6</strong>, adjusting the number of dice kept if Advantage or Disadvantage applies.</li>
        <li>Add the relevant Attribute rating and any bonuses from Skills or temporary effects.</li>
        <li>Compare the total to the DC to find the margin (Roll − DC).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The margin determines the outcome tier:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critical Success</strong>: Margin ≥ +5.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Success</strong>: Margin ≥ 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Partial Success</strong>: Margin −1 to −2.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure</strong>: Margin ≤ −3.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong>: Margin ≤ −7 or all 1s.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="interpreting-outcomes">Interpreting Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Every outcome tier should change the situation. The GM and players work together to describe what the
        dice mean in the fiction.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critical Success</strong> – You achieve more than you aimed for. Extra benefits, stronger
          position, or accelerated progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Success</strong> – You get what you wanted with no significant cost. The scene moves
          forward cleanly.</li>
        <li><strong>Partial Success</strong> – You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect.
          Momentum continues, tension rises.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure</strong> – You do not achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Threats
          advance, resources strain, or positions worsen.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> – Things go significantly wrong. Use sparingly for dramatic beats:
          broken tools, dangerous exposure, or major escalations.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Cross‑Genre Check</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> In a cozy town, a character tries to calm a panicked neighbor during a storm. In a
        sci‑fi station, a character tries to reassure a frightened technician during a systems failure.<br />
        <em>Roll:</em> Both are PRE‑based Checks against DC 14 (Routine) with an appropriate social Skill. The
        cozy scene might grant Advantage if the characters have a strong existing relationship.<br />
        <em>Consequence:</em> Full success calms the NPC and stabilizes the scene. Partial success calms them but
        attaches a new obligation or rumor. Failure escalates the panic, spreading fear or misinformation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="group-checks-and-assistance">Group Checks and Assistance</h3>
      <p>
        Many actions involve more than one character. Rather than rolling for everyone separately every time, the
        GM can use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assistance</strong>: One character leads the action, another assists. If the assistance is
          credible in the fiction, the leader gains Advantage or a small bonus.</li>
        <li><strong>Representative Checks</strong>: One Check stands in for a coordinated group effort. The
          outcome tier describes how the whole group fares.</li>
        <li><strong>Split Risks</strong>: Two or more characters each roll, and the GM focuses on the most
          interesting combination of results rather than tracking every detail.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pick the method that best fits the moment. Use single rolls when you want quick resolution. Use
        individual rolls when it is important that different characters face different consequences.
      </p>

      <h3 id="checks-and-clocks">Checks and Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Some obstacles are too big for a single Check. Instead, the GM creates a Clock with several segments.
        Successful Checks tick the Clock forward; failures or partial successes may tick related threat Clocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Clocks when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Characters are working toward a long‑term goal, such as investigating a mystery or repairing a ship.</li>
        <li>A danger is mounting over time, such as a collapsing tunnel, spreading fire, or advancing enemy force.</li>
        <li>Two or more forces are racing toward different outcomes (opposing Clocks).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Clock and Checks</strong><br />
        <em>Trigger:</em> The group works to evacuate a district before floodwaters arrive.<br />
        <em>Clocks:</em> “Evacuation Complete” (6 segments) and “Flood Waters Rise” (4 segments).<br />
        <em>Rolls:</em> Each scene, characters make MIG, AGI, PRE, or RSN Checks based on their chosen
        contributions—lifting sandbags, coordinating crowds, analyzing routes. Successes advance the evacuation
        clock; failures or partials tick the flood clock or create new complications.<br />
        <em>Outcome:</em> Which clock fills first determines whether the district is saved, partially saved, or
        overwhelmed.
      </div>

      <h3 id="keeping-momentum">Keeping Momentum</h3>
      <p>
        Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action.</li>
        <li>Let Failures create new problems, reveal information, or shift the situation rather than blocking
          all paths.</li>
        <li>Allow retries only when the circumstances or approach meaningfully change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is not to punish characters for rolling poorly. The goal is to discover what happens next when
        risk meets intent. If the table keeps that in view, Checks will feel like natural beats in the story
        rather than interruptions.
      </p>

    <section id="ch-09-tags-conditions-clocks">
      <h2 id="tags-conditions-clocks-heading">9. Tags, Conditions, and Clocks</h2>

      <p>
        Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive.
        They connect description to mechanics so that rain, fear, injuries, crowds, and looming deadlines all
        matter at the table. This chapter explains what each of these tools is for, how to use them, and how
        they interact with Checks.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tags-vs-conditions">Tags vs. Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Tags describe <strong>the environment or situation</strong>. They belong to places, scenes, objects, or
        circumstances: <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Slick</em>, <em>Crowded</em>, <em>Fragile Cover</em>. Tags affect
        what you can do in a space and how you do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conditions describe <strong>your character’s state</strong>. They follow you from one location to the
        next until cleared: <em>Exhausted</em>, <em>Bleeding</em>, <em>Frightened</em>, <em>Restrained</em>.
        Conditions affect your actions wherever you go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions are the shared vocabulary the table uses to talk about advantages, risks, and
        lingering consequences. They are not extra subsystems to memorize. They are the names you give to
        things you are already describing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-tags-do">What Tags Do</h3>
      <p>
        A Tag is a short descriptor applied to a scene, location, object, or situation. It becomes a flag:
        “remember this when resolving actions here.” Tags typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grant Advantage or Disadvantage on certain Checks.</li>
        <li>Raise or lower DCs for specific actions.</li>
        <li>Change position or effect (how risky an action feels or how big its impact is).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You do not tag every detail. A room is just a room until its darkness, instability, crowd, or sacred
        significance matters to what characters are attempting. Tag the things that will shape decisions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="common-tag-categories">Common Tag Categories</h3>
      <p>
        While Chapter 18 provides an extended reference, this chapter introduces three broad categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Environmental Tags</strong> – Physical features of space: <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Slick</em>,
          <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Elevated</em>, <em>Solid Cover</em>, <em>Fragile Cover</em>, <em>Unstable</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Situational Tags</strong> – Circumstances and pressures: <em>Crowded</em>, <em>Alert</em>,
          <em>Hazardous</em>, <em>Obscured</em>, <em>Surveillance</em>, <em>Networked</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Atmospheric Tags</strong> – Social or emotional tone: <em>Tense</em>, <em>Festive</em>,
          <em>Solemn</em>, <em>Suspicious</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can invent new Tags that fit your setting. The important part is agreeing at the table what a Tag
        does in practice: which actions it helps, which it hinders, and how it shapes consequences.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Tags in a Warehouse Fight</strong><br />
        The GM describes a warehouse full of stacked crates, narrow aisles, and oil-spotted floors. They assign
        the Tags <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Fragile Cover</em>, and <em>Slick</em>.<br />
        <em>Cramped</em> makes wide swings and large weapons awkward. <em>Fragile Cover</em> means wooden crates
        can be shredded by fire, potentially stripping cover away. <em>Slick</em> imposes Disadvantage on fast
        movement or acrobatic maneuvers. Every decision in this scene now has texture.
      </div>

      <h3 id="what-conditions-do">What Conditions Do</h3>
      <p>
        Conditions represent persistent states that modify what a character can safely attempt. They are the
        mechanical mark left by consequences. When something important happens to you—injury, fear, strain,
        affliction—it often becomes a Condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conditions typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Impose Disadvantage on certain actions.</li>
        <li>Limit available options (cannot run, cannot act this turn, cannot speak clearly).</li>
        <li>Threaten further harm if ignored (ongoing damage, ticking Clocks).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="examples-of-common-conditions">Examples of Common Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        A full alphabetical list appears in the Glossary. Here are a few you will see often:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exhausted</strong> – Disadvantage on demanding physical actions until you rest or receive
          meaningful aid.</li>
        <li><strong>Bleeding</strong> – Time pressure from an untreated wound. If not stabilized, it may tick a
          personal Clock or escalate to worse states.</li>
        <li><strong>Restrained</strong> – You are held or pinned. You cannot move freely and must break free or
          be helped.</li>
        <li><strong>Dazed</strong> – Disoriented; Disadvantage on perception and reaction until you recover.</li>
        <li><strong>Frightened</strong> – Disadvantage on actions while a specific threat is visible; clears when
          you rally, escape, or defeat the source.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – From Event to Condition</strong><br />
        A character fails a Check while crossing a compromised catwalk. Rather than simple damage, the GM
        describes how they slam into the railing and twist their knee. They gain the Condition
        <em>Exhausted</em> or <em>Weakened</em>, representing reduced stamina. Future physical actions are harder
        until they rest or receive treatment.
      </div>

      <h3 id="using-tags-and-conditions-with-checks">Using Tags and Conditions with Checks</h3>
      <p>
        Tags and Conditions do not require new rules. They plug directly into the Check system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tags often grant Advantage or Disadvantage on Checks that interact with them.</li>
        <li>Conditions usually impose Disadvantage or limit which approaches are reasonable.</li>
        <li>Some Tags shift DCs or change position and effect instead of modifying dice directly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you are about to roll, quickly review which Tags and Conditions are relevant. Ask: “Does this make
        the action easier, harder, or riskier?” Then adjust Advantage/Disadvantage, DC, or consequences
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Tag and Condition Interaction</strong><br />
        In a horror‑tinged mystery, a character stalks through a foggy graveyard at night. The scene has Tags
        <em>Dim Light</em> and <em>Obscured</em>. The character is also <em>Frightened</em> from a previous
        encounter.<br />
        When they attempt to sneak past patrolling figures, <em>Dim Light</em> and <em>Obscured</em> might grant
        Advantage on Stealth, but <em>Frightened</em> could impose Disadvantage on actions taken while the threat
        is visible. The GM weighs these factors, cancels opposing modifiers as needed, and describes how the
        character’s shaky nerves show up in the fiction.
      </div>

      <h3 id="introducing-and-clearing-conditions">Introducing and Clearing Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Conditions should follow naturally from events. A failed Check in a hazardous area might cause
        <em>Bleeding</em> or <em>Poisoned</em>. Exposure to overwhelming sights might cause <em>Frightened</em>.
        Pushing beyond safe limits might cause <em>Exhausted</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you introduce a Condition, state:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What it represents in the fiction.</li>
        <li>How it affects actions (which Checks it modifies and how).</li>
        <li>How it can be cleared (time, rest, treatment, facing a fear, or completing a Clock).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Minor Conditions should clear quickly once addressed. Major Conditions may persist across several scenes
        or form the basis for character‑driven goals.
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-clocks-are">What Clocks Are</h3>
      <p>
        Clocks are segmented trackers that answer “how close are we?” for goals and threats. A Clock is a circle
        or track divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments. As actions succeed, time passes, or events occur, segments
        fill. When the Clock completes, something happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Clocks to represent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Long‑term goals</strong> – Research projects, faction plans, character endeavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Mounting threats</strong> – Approaching storms, advancing enemies, spreading plagues.</li>
        <li><strong>Ticking dangers</strong> – Rituals completing, bombs counting down, collapsing structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Faction projects</strong> – Off‑screen activities of NPCs and organizations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="advancing-clocks">Advancing Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Clocks advance in several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Success‑based</strong> – Successful Checks tick a project Clock forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Time‑based</strong> – Segments fill as scenes pass or as in‑world time moves.</li>
        <li><strong>Event‑based</strong> – Specific narrative events advance background or faction Clocks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Partial successes often advance a Clock and introduce a complication. Exceptional successes may jump a
        Clock by more than one segment. Failures might leave a Clock unchanged while pushing forward a related
        threat Clock.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Investigation and Cover‑Up Clocks</strong><br />
        The group is investigating a corrupt official.</div>
      <p>
        The GM creates an “Expose the Official” Clock with 6 segments and a “Cover‑Up” Clock with 4 segments.
        Successful RSN‑based investigation, social, or infiltration Checks advance the first Clock. Certain
        failures, loud approaches, or conspicuous visits advance the second. Which Clock fills first determines
        whether the truth comes out cleanly, is revealed with fallout, or is buried.
      </p>

      <h3 id="combining-tags-conditions-clocks">Combining Tags, Conditions, and Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        These tools are most powerful when used together:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tags set the stage: terrain, lighting, crowds, magical effects.</li>
        <li>Conditions show how previous events cling to characters and shape their options.</li>
        <li>Clocks track momentum toward outcomes that matter over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A single scene might involve a <em>Hazardous</em> Tag, characters who are <em>Exhausted</em>, and a
        “Structural Collapse” Clock. Every roll becomes a meaningful choice about risk, effort, and timing.
      </p>

      <div class="gm">
        <strong>GM Guidance – Start Small</strong>
        You do not need Tags, Conditions, and Clocks on every scene. Start with one or two Tags that matter, a
        few Conditions that arise naturally, and a single important Clock. Add more only when they clarify the
        fiction rather than clutter it. When in doubt, ask: “Does this tool make the situation clearer and more
        interesting?” If yes, use it.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="ch-10-combat-basics">
      <h2 id="combat-basics-heading">10. Combat Basics</h2>

      <p>
        Combat is one kind of scene the system supports. It uses the same resolution tools you have already
        learned—Attributes, Skills, Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on immediate danger and tactical
        choices. This chapter introduces how combat scenes are framed, how turns work, and how to use the core
        combat actions to shape the fiction.
      </p>

      <h3 id="combat-as-a-scene">Combat as a Scene</h3>
      <p>
        Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment‑to‑moment sequence of actions matters. The GM does
        not call for “initiative” the first time someone raises a voice. They wait until it is important to know
        who acts in what order and how threats respond.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table can always ask, “Is this a structured combat now, or are we still in free conversation?” Use
        structured turns when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple combatants are acting and order matters.</li>
        <li>Position, timing, and action economy are tactically significant.</li>
        <li>Players benefit from clarity about who goes when.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Stay in loose, conversational play when a moment can be resolved with a few Checks and clear narration.
        Not every scuffle needs the full structure of a fight. Many tense scenes will move fluidly between free
        narration, a short exchange of blows, and back again without ever feeling like a separate “combat mode.”
      </p>

      <h3 id="resolve-instead-of-hit-points">Resolve Instead of Hit Points</h3>
      <p>
        The system does not track hit points. Instead, it uses Clocks and Conditions to represent how close
        someone is to being taken out of a fight.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resolve Clocks</strong> track how much pressure or harm a character, VPC, or enemy can absorb
          before they are out of the scene.</li>
        <li><strong>Conditions</strong> such as <em>Bleeding</em>, <em>Exhausted</em>, or <em>Stunned</em> mark
          lasting effects of blows, hazards, or fear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you land solid Strikes or create meaningful pressure with Maneuvers and Set Ups, the GM ticks your
        opponent’s Resolve Clock. When the Clock fills, they are out—fleeing, unconscious, captured, or worse,
        depending on the fiction and the stakes the table agreed to.
      </p>

      <h4 id="why-clocks-not-hit-points">Why Clocks and Not Hit Points?</h4>
      <p>
        Clocks keep combat aligned with the goals of this system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fiction first</strong> – A character is taken out when the story supports it, not at an
          arbitrary number. A VPC might quit the field when they are cornered, not only at “0 HP.”</li>
        <li><strong>Visible progress</strong> – A Resolve Clock filling is easy to read at the table. Everyone
          can feel that a fight is turning without tracking hidden totals.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible stakes</strong> – Clocks can represent being driven off, captured, convinced, or
          killed, depending on the stakes you set. Not every fight needs to end in death.</li>
        <li><strong>Pacing control</strong> – The GM can size clocks to match the scene: 2–3 segments for quick,
          cinematic threats, more for major foes or climactic battles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hit points tend to push every fight toward the same outcome—gradual depletion to zero. Resolve Clocks and
        Conditions instead invite you to think in terms of moments: when does this opponent falter, when do they
        become desperate, when do they finally break. That emphasis keeps combat tied to character, genre, and
        story rather than pure attrition.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Enemy Resolve</strong><br />
        A dangerous VPC has a 6‑segment Resolve Clock. Each Full Success on a Strike or a particularly effective
        Maneuver ticks 2 segments; Partial successes tick 1 segment with a cost. As the Clock fills, the GM
        describes them becoming desperate, defensive, or reckless. When the sixth segment ticks, they are out of
        the fight in a way that fits the story.
      </div>

      <p>
        Player characters can be tracked in the same way. The GM will make it clear when you are close to being
        taken out so you can decide whether to keep pressing or break contact and regroup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before a fight begins, the table should briefly agree on what “taken out” means in this scene. Are you
        trying to kill, rout, capture, or simply delay? The same Resolve Clock can represent different outcomes
        depending on those stakes. This keeps combat aligned with the tone of your campaign and avoids surprises
        about consequences.
      </p>

      <h3 id="turns-and-order">Turns and Order</h3>
      <p>
        Combat uses structured turns, but order does not have to be rigid. The GM chooses an ordering approach
        that fits the scene:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conversational order</strong> – The GM asks “Who acts next?” and rotates spotlight. Simple
          and flexible for small skirmishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Popcorn order</strong> – After you resolve your turn, you choose who goes next. This keeps
          attention moving and avoids predictable patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Initiative (optional)</strong> – If the table prefers, you can use a simple initiative roll
          or fiction‑based ordering for more structure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whatever method you choose, keep it consistent within a given combat and make sure everyone understands
        who is up next.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Conversational vs. Structured Order</strong><br />
        A heated argument with a gang in a market turns violent when someone draws a knife. The GM first handles
        a quick exchange in conversation: a shove here, a shouted warning there. When three different people all
        want to act at once—one flees, one attacks, one grabs a hostage—the GM says, “We’re in structured turns
        now,” and switches to popcorn order so everyone sees how the moment unfolds.
      </div>

      <h3 id="your-turn-structure">Your Turn: Structure and Options</h3>
      <p>
        On your turn, you usually:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe what you do in the fiction.</li>
        <li>Move within the space as needed (closing, retreating, repositioning).</li>
        <li>Take one main action, such as Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, or Defend/Withdraw.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you want to do something small alongside your main action—call out a warning, kick over a chair, draw
        a weapon—talk with the GM. If it feels reasonable and cinematic without overshadowing other characters,
        it often fits into the same turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your turn is a spotlight, not a restriction. The structure exists to make sure everyone gets time to act
        and react. Think about what your character cares about in the scene—who they are protecting, what they
        are afraid of losing—and let that guide how you use your turn.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core-combat-actions">Core Combat Actions</h3>
      <p>
        Combat does not introduce a separate rule set. It highlights a small group of common actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strike</strong> – Directly attack a target.</li>
        <li><strong>Maneuver</strong> – Change position, create openings, or control space.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up</strong> – Create Advantage or helpful Tags for yourself or allies.</li>
        <li><strong>Defend / Withdraw</strong> – Protect yourself or break contact to recover.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="action-strike">Strike</h4>
      <p>
        Strike represents any direct attempt to harm or overpower an opponent: swinging a weapon, firing a shot,
        hurling debris, or unleashing focused abilities. You describe your attack, the GM sets the DC based on
        your opponent’s awareness, cover, and Tags, and you roll a Check.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a Full Success, you significantly advance their Resolve or impose serious pressure. On a Partial
        Success, you still make progress but at a cost—perhaps you become <em>Exposed</em>, suffer a counterblow,
        or worsen the environment. On a Failure, your attack misses or glances off, and the GM may give your
        opponent a positional or narrative advantage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strike is the most straightforward way to change the board, but not always the best first move. Against
        tough opponents in strong positions, consider using Set Up or Maneuver to tilt the field before you
        commit to repeated Strikes.
      </p>

      <h4 id="action-maneuver">Maneuver</h4>
      <p>
        Maneuver covers tactical actions that change the situation rather than simply dealing harm: shoving an
        enemy off high ground, tripping them, pulling an ally out of danger, seizing cover, or knocking aside
        a weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Maneuver when position, Tags, or Conditions matter more than raw damage. A successful Maneuver can
        create <em>Prone</em>, strip <em>Solid Cover</em>, or apply a useful Tag such as <em>Exposed</em> that
        allies can exploit on later turns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maneuvers are where you see genre shine. In cozy scenes, a Maneuver might be flipping a table to block a
        doorway or herding people toward safety. In horror, it might be slamming a vault door shut or cutting a
        rope bridge. In sci‑fi, venting a compartment or cycling gravity can change everything without a single
        Strike.
      </p>

      <h4 id="action-setup">Set Up</h4>
      <p>
        Set Up sacrifices immediate impact to create better opportunities: laying down suppressing fire, feinting
        to draw attention, calling out weak points, or coordinating a flanking position. On a Full Success, you
        grant Advantage or establish a helpful Tag for yourself or allies; on a Partial, you still create the
        opening but at some cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good use of Set Up can turn a desperate fight into a manageable one. It shines when your own Strike
        chances are low or when an ally can capitalize more effectively on the Advantage you create.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a rule of thumb, if the group is facing a higher‑tier threat (a dangerous VPC or major enemy), expect
        the first rounds to involve more Set Ups and Maneuvers than Strikes. Once the table has created better
        positions, cover, and Advantage, Strikes become dramatically more effective.
      </p>

      <h4 id="action-defend-withdraw">Defend / Withdraw</h4>
      <p>
        Defend/Withdraw represents actively protecting yourself or pulling back from danger: diving behind cover,
        blocking an attack, or breaking contact to regroup. On a Full Success, you avoid incoming harm or reach
        a safer position. On a Partial, you mitigate the danger but pay a cost—perhaps taking a lesser Condition
        or yielding ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        This action is how you buy time when Conditions stack up or your Resolve is nearly full. Using
        Defend/Withdraw at the right moment is often the difference between a character being taken out or
        surviving to fight another day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Defend/Withdraw is also how you signal a change in priorities. When multiple characters start using it,
        the fiction is telling you the fight is shifting from “win here” to “escape, regroup, or change the
        stakes.” Pay attention to those moments; they often mark turning points in a campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="positioning-and-environment">Positioning and Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Tags play a major role in combat. <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Elevated</em>,
        <em>Fragile Cover</em>, <em>Slick</em>, and similar Tags can make certain actions easier or harder, or
        change what is possible at all. Manege position and Tags as carefully as you manage Checks.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Using the Battlefield</strong><br />
        In a rooftop fight marked as <em>Elevated</em> with scattered <em>Fragile Cover</em>, one character uses
        Maneuver to shove a foe toward the edge, threatening a fall. Another uses Set Up to flank, granting
        Advantage on subsequent Strikes. The GM treats <em>Elevated</em> as granting Advantage on ranged attacks
        from high ground and adds extra risk to any failed Checks near the edge.
      </div>

      <h3 id="conditions-in-combat">Conditions in Combat</h3>
      <p>
        Many combat consequences are expressed as Conditions: being <em>Stunned</em> by a concussive blast,
        <em>Bleeding</em> after a severe hit, or <em>Suppressed</em> by incoming fire. These Conditions modify
        subsequent Checks and shape choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever a Condition is applied in combat, the GM should state how long it lasts and how it can be
        cleared. For example, <em>Stunned</em> might end after you lose your next action, while
        <em>Exhausted</em> may persist until you rest between scenes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Multiple Conditions can stack in dangerous ways. A character who is both <em>Bleeding</em> and
        <em>Exhausted</em> is under pressure each round and rolling with Disadvantage on many actions. Scenes
        like this are signals to change tactics—seek cover, call for help, or end the fight on your own terms.
      </p>

      <h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting It Together</h3>
      <p>
        A typical combat turn might look like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The GM describes the scene, including relevant Tags and visible threats.</li>
        <li>You state intent and approach, choosing a core combat action.</li>
        <li>The GM sets DC, notes any Advantage/Disadvantage, and clarifies stakes.</li>
        <li>You roll <strong>4d6</strong>, apply modifiers, and compare to DC.</li>
        <li>The group interprets the outcome tier, ticking Clocks and applying Tags or Conditions as needed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Across several rounds, you will see patterns emerge: early positioning and Set Ups, decisive Strikes when
        Advantage and Tags line up, Conditions and Clocks signaling rising danger, and Defend/Withdraw actions
        when the tide turns. Treat each fight as a story with a beginning, middle, and end rather than as a
        series of disconnected attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this book expands on combat by showing how Tags, Conditions, Skills, Proficiencies, NPCs,
        VPCs, and GM tools combine to create varied, genre‑flexible fights. The goal is always the same: keep
        the fiction moving, keep consequences meaningful, and let the battlefield tell part of the story.

    <section id="ch-11-exploration-social-play">
      <h2 id="exploration-social-play-heading">11. Exploration and Social Play</h2>

      <p>
        Exploration and social play cover everything that happens outside of direct combat. Investigating crime
        scenes, navigating dangerous terrain, decoding signals, negotiating alliances, and reading a crowded
        room all use the same core mechanics—Checks, Tags, Conditions, and Clocks—focused on discovery, choice,
        and momentum rather than immediate harm.
      </p>

      <h3 id="exploration-overview">Exploration Overview</h3>
      <p>
        In exploration scenes, the GM presents situations, spaces, and mysteries. Players describe what their
        characters do: search, travel, tinker, observe, or test. When uncertainty, consequence, and agency are
        present, a Check resolves whether the attempt reveals information, overcomes an obstacle, or creates a
        new problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploration is not “filler between fights.” It is where many campaigns decide their tone: cozy
        neighborhood investigations, tense horror crawls, sprawling journeys, or intricate political maneuvering.
        Treat exploration choices as meaningful as any combat decision.
      </p>

      <h3 id="investigation-and-discovery">Investigation and Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        When investigating, start with a clear question: “What am I trying to learn?” Then describe how you
        pursue it. Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“I examine the desk for hidden compartments and false bottoms.”</li>
        <li>“I compare the shipping logs with telegraph records for discrepancies.”</li>
        <li>“I walk the perimeter, looking for unusual footprints or tool marks.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The GM chooses an Attribute and any relevant Skills, sets a DC based on how well‑hidden or complex the
        information is, and calls for a Check if needed. On a Full Success, you get a clear answer or strong
        lead. On a Partial Success, you learn something useful but pay a cost—time passes, someone notices, or
        the clue is incomplete. On a Failure, you miss the key detail or trigger a complication.
      </p>

      <p>
        Investigation often uses paired Clocks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Progress Clocks</strong> for goals such as “Identify the culprit,” “Decode the pattern,” or
          “Map the tunnels.” Successful Checks tick these forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure Clocks</strong> for dangers such as “Guards return,” “Evidence destroyed,” or
          “Storm closes in.” Partial successes and Failures may tick these.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Dual Investigation Clocks</strong><br />
        The group investigates a sabotaged telegraph relay. The GM creates a 6‑segment “Find the saboteur” Clock
        and a 4‑segment “Relay shutdown” Clock. Each successful RSN‑based Check (examining equipment, tracing
        messages, interviewing operators) advances the first. Certain Failures or time‑consuming approaches tick
        the second. Which fills first determines whether the saboteur is exposed before the network goes dark.
      </div>

      <h3 id="travel-and-environmental-challenges">Travel and Environmental Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Journeys, hazardous terrain, and environmental puzzles are handled with the same principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define the route, obstacles, and stakes.</li>
        <li>Assign Tags to the environment (<em>Slick</em>, <em>Cramped</em>, <em>Hazardous</em>,
          <em>Obscured</em>).</li>
        <li>Use Checks and Clocks to track progress and risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Long journeys can be condensed into a handful of key scenes. Each scene presents a meaningful choice: push
        for speed at higher risk, detour for safety at the cost of time, or engage with an opportunity or threat
        the GM introduces along the way.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Crossing the Floodplain</strong><br />
        The group must cross a floodplain before the next storm. The GM tags the region as <em>Hazardous</em> and
        <em>Unstable</em> and creates a “Reach Higher Ground” Clock and a “Waters Rise” Clock. Each scene, the
        players choose approaches—careful scouting, constructing makeshift bridges, or pushing through quickly.
        RSN, MIG, or AGI Checks advance progress or risk. Fictional choices about camps, supplies, and routes
        matter as much as the dice.
      </div>

      <h3 id="social-interaction">Social Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        Social scenes—persuasion, negotiation, deception, and reading people—use the same core loop:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clarify what you want from the other party.</li>
        <li>Describe your approach and how you present yourself.</li>
        <li>GM sets DC and Tags for the scene (<em>Tense</em>, <em>Festive</em>, <em>Suspicious</em>,
          <em>Profit‑Minded</em>).</li>
        <li>Roll Checks and interpret outcome tiers as changes in trust, position, or opportunity.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Presence‑based Skills often lead here, but other Attributes can matter. A Reasoned argument, a Might‑backed
        display of capability, or an Agility‑based demonstration can all shift attitudes when grounded in the
        fiction.
      </p>

      <h3 id="negotiation-and-leverage">Negotiation and Leverage</h3>
      <p>
        Effective negotiation starts with understanding what the other side values. Before making big offers,
        consider using Insight or similar approaches to read their priorities. Are they driven by profit, duty,
        fear, or reputation? Tags like <em>Profit‑Minded</em>, <em>Honor‑Bound</em>, or <em>Desperate</em> can
        help anchor these traits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you know what matters to them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identify leverage</strong> – information, access, protection, or resources that speak directly
          to their needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Frame your offer</strong> – present your proposal in terms of their goals, not yours.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Clocks for complex deals</strong> – “Deal Secured” or “Trust Established” can track
          multi‑round negotiations.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Multi‑Round Negotiation</strong><br />
        The group negotiates safe passage with a gang leader tagged as <em>Ruthless</em> and
        <em>Profit‑Minded</em>. Early rounds focus on proving value and reliability, filling a “Consider Their
        Offer” Clock. Later rounds solidify terms. Each Check can move the Clock forward or back, with Partial
        successes adding new demands or concessions. When the Clock completes, the leader commits to a course of
        action—ally, neutral, or rival.
      </div>

      <h3 id="deception-and-reading-people">Deception and Reading People</h3>
      <p>
        Deception is high‑risk and high‑reward. Successful lies open doors; failed lies create enemies. Keep lies
        simple, grounded in partial truths, and aligned with visible facts when possible. The GM may grant
        Advantage when your story matches what NPCs can already see or believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading people through Insight or similar approaches lets you detect lies, gauge mood, and identify
        pressure points. On Full Success, the GM can tell you what an NPC most wants right now or what they are
        afraid will happen. On Partial Success, you get a rough sense with some uncertainty or risk being
        noticed.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Interrogation Contest</strong><br />
        A smuggler is captured in a quiet back room. First, intimidation fails to crack his loyalty, but ticks a
        Pressure Clock as his crew starts wondering where he is. Then the characters switch to deception,
        claiming his boss has already betrayed him. A contested Check between the character’s PRE‑based deception
        and the smuggler’s Insight decides whether he believes the story. The outcome determines whether he
        reveals the shipment’s location or shuts down entirely.
      </div>

      <h3 id="structuring-scenes-with-clocks">Structuring Scenes with Clocks</h3>
      <p>
        Clocks are especially valuable in exploration and social play, where many small actions add up to big
        changes. Use them to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track layered goals (investigation, preparation, influence).</li>
        <li>Represent background events (faction plans, approaching deadlines).</li>
        <li>Create tension in otherwise open‑ended situations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many campaigns, the most memorable scenes are not single Checks but sequences where Clocks visibly
        advance, threats close in, and players make hard choices about which fronts to address first.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tying-exploration-and-social-back-to-combat">Tying Exploration and Social Back to Combat</h3>
      <p>
        Exploration and social play are not separate from combat—they shape it. Successfully mapping a site,
        securing allies, or learning an enemy’s habits can create Tags, Clocks, or Advantages that pay off
        immediately when blades are drawn. Likewise, the outcome of a fight often creates new questions to
        investigate or relationships to repair.
      </p>
      <p>
        When planning sessions, think in arcs: exploration reveals opportunities and risks, social play navigates
        them, and combat resolves the moments where words and careful planning are no longer enough. Then the
        story returns to exploration and social play, changed by what happened in the heat of the moment.

      <h3 id="downtime-overview">Downtime Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Downtime represents the hours, days, or weeks when characters are not in immediate danger. It is a space
        for rest, training, projects, and relationships. Good downtime:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lets characters recover from consequences and Conditions.</li>
        <li>Creates room for personal goals beyond the main plot.</li>
        <li>Seeds future adventures through projects and connections.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The GM and players decide how much in‑world time passes. A short downtime might cover a night between
        missions; a long one might span a season.
      </p>

      <h3 id="recovery-and-rest">Recovery and Rest</h3>
      <p>
        Rest is the foundation of recovery:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short rest</strong> – A few hours to catch breath, bind wounds, and clear minor Conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Long rest</strong> – A full night or more to reset after major exertion.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended downtime</strong> – Days or weeks that allow deep recovery, training, and projects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many Conditions clear automatically with appropriate rest: <em>Exhausted</em> fades after sleep,
        <em>Bleeding</em> resolves after treatment and time, minor <em>Frightened</em> states ease once the threat
        passes. More serious Conditions—<em>Poisoned</em>, <em>Cursed</em>, or long‑term injuries—may require
        specialized care, quests, or narrative solutions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="downtime-activities">Downtime Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond simple rest, characters can dedicate downtime to structured activities. Common examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Training</strong> – Practicing with mentors, refining Skills, or conditioning Attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Research</strong> – Studying lore, tracking rumors, or analyzing data.</li>
        <li><strong>Crafting</strong> – Building or modifying gear, tools, or infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships</strong> – Strengthening bonds with NPCs, factions, or communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Projects</strong> – Pursuing long‑term goals like founding a safehouse or establishing a
          network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each activity usually:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consumes a defined unit of downtime (a day, a week, a season).</li>
        <li>May involve one or more Checks, often against a progress Clock.</li>
        <li>Produces concrete outcomes: Skills gained, information uncovered, allies won, or structures built.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Training as a Clock</strong><br />
        A character seeks to learn a new Blades Skill from a retired duelist. The GM creates a 6‑segment “Train
        with Master Valen” Clock. Each week of focused training, the player rolls AGI or RSN against a moderate
        DC. Full successes tick 2 segments, partials tick 1. When the Clock fills, they gain the Skill and a new
        relationship with Valen as an ongoing contact.
      </div>

      <h3 id="long-term-projects">Long‑Term Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Some goals are too large for a single downtime period. Long‑term projects use bigger Clocks and are often
        tied directly to campaign arcs. Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishing a spy network in a city.</li>
        <li>Building or upgrading a stronghold.</li>
        <li>Rehabilitating a neighborhood or recovering from a disaster.</li>
        <li>Reconciling or reshaping relationships between factions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For each project, work with the GM to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define the end state (what “complete” looks like).</li>
        <li>Set a progress Clock sized to the goal.</li>
        <li>Identify key milestones or phases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Progress can come from downtime, on‑screen adventures, or both. Setbacks may create separate “Complication”
        Clocks that, if filled, delay or transform the project. Treat these as story opportunities rather than
        punishment.
      </p>

      <h3 id="relationships-factions-and-standing">Relationships, Factions, and Standing</h3>
      <p>
        Downtime is also when you invest in people. Characters can nurture friendships, manage obligations, and
        shift their standing with factions. Many groups find it helpful to track faction standing on a simple
        ladder:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hostile</strong> – actively opposed, may move against you.</li>
        <li><strong>Unfriendly</strong> – suspicious, minimal cooperation, inflated prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral</strong> – transactional; standard treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Friendly</strong> – helpful; discounts, information, and small favors.</li>
        <li><strong>Honored</strong> – invested in your success; serious support and protection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Significant actions—rescuing allies, defending territory, forwarding or opposing a faction’s goals—move
        standing up or down. Neglect can also matter; if you ignore an important relationship for a long time,
        the GM may introduce a Clock that tracks fading trust until you reconnect.
      </p>

      <h3 id="advancement-overview">Advancement Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Advancement represents mechanical growth: new Skills, expanded Proficiencies, and occasional Attribute
        improvements. It should also reflect narrative change: what your character has learned, how they have
        changed, and which arcs have moved forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three common progression models. Your table can use one or blend them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>XP‑based advancement</strong> – You earn experience points for overcoming challenges and
          achieving goals, then spend XP on Skills, Proficiencies, or Attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Milestone‑based advancement</strong> – You advance when you reach narrative milestones, such
          as completing arcs or defeating major threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Session‑based advancement</strong> – You advance after a set number of sessions, regardless of
          specific story beats.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Chapter 19, “Advancement and Long Term Growth,” provides detailed guidance, including costs, pacing, and
        genre‑specific advice. This chapter focuses on how advancement feels and how it connects to downtime.
      </p>

      <h3 id="narrative-arcs-and-growth">Narrative Arcs and Growth</h3>
      <p>
        Progression is most satisfying when mechanical changes follow narrative arcs. When you advance, ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What has my character learned or survived recently?</li>
        <li>How have their beliefs, relationships, or goals shifted?</li>
        <li>Which new capabilities reflect that change?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tie new Skills, Proficiencies, or Attribute bumps to concrete experiences in play: training scenes,
        pivotal choices, or climactic confrontations. This keeps growth feeling earned and grounded.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Advancement Tied to Arc</strong><br />
        After exposing a corrupt official and choosing to protect whistleblowers instead of seeking revenge, a
        character gains a social Proficiency focused on coordination and advocacy and a new investigative Skill.
        These advancements reflect their shift from lone operator to community organizer, making future scenes
        about those themes richer.
      </div>

      <h3 id="connecting-advancement-to-downtime">Connecting Advancement to Downtime</h3>
      <p>
        Downtime activities and advancement reinforce each other:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Training and projects can justify or accelerate new Skills and Proficiencies.</li>
        <li>Research and relationships can unlock opportunities that become advancement milestones.</li>
        <li>Long‑term projects can culminate in major advancement events (new Attributes, expanded domains).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When the table discusses advancement, consider what downtime scenes you want to play to show that growth.
        Likewise, when you plan downtime, think about which kinds of growth you hope it will make possible.
      </p>

      <h3 id="table-practices-for-downtime-and-advancement">Table Practices for Downtime and Advancement</h3>
      <p>
        A few simple practices keep downtime and advancement smooth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Talk about goals openly—what each player wants for their character between arcs.</li>
        <li>Choose a progression model together and revisit it if the pacing feels off.</li>
        <li>Use Clocks to track projects and relationships you care about, not every minor task.</li>
        <li>Let advancement decisions wait until you see how a story beat lands; pick changes that fit the outcome.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Downtime, recovery, and advancement are where the campaign breathes. Use them to give characters room to
        change, deepen ties to the world, and set up the next set of hard choices.

    <section id="ch-13-roleplaying-guidance-working-with-gm">
      <h2 id="roleplaying-guidance-working-with-gm-heading">13. Roleplaying Guidance and Working with the GM</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter focuses on how to play the game well at the table—how to inhabit your character, share
        spotlight, read the fiction, and collaborate with the GM and other players. The mechanics in earlier
        chapters provide tools. This chapter helps you use them in a way that keeps play fun, clear, and
        respectful for everyone.
      </p>

      <h3 id="roleplaying-fundamentals">Roleplaying Fundamentals</h3>
      <p>
        Roleplaying means making decisions from your character’s point of view. You do not need to speak in
        accents or stay “in character” every minute, but it helps to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Think about what your character wants, fears, and cares about.</li>
        <li>Let those priorities shape your choices, even when they are not tactically perfect.</li>
        <li>React to events as your character, not just as a player solving a puzzle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your goal is not to “win” the story. It is to help create a story that everyone at the table is excited
        to remember.
      </p>

      <h3 id="creating-memorable-characters">Creating Memorable Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Memorable characters often share three traits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distinct voice</strong> – A recognizable way of speaking or behaving.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear motivations</strong> – Goals and drives that explain why they act.</li>
        <li><strong>Flaws and strengths</strong> – Imperfections that create conflict and qualities that carry them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Voice can be as simple as a few phrases, a posture, or a habit. Motivations might be justice, curiosity,
        loyalty, or survival. Flaws—stubbornness, pride, mistrust—give scenes bite. Strengths—compassion,
        courage, expertise—give your character ways to shine.
      </p>

      <h3 id="engaging-with-the-fiction">Engaging with the Fiction</h3>
      <p>
        The game works best when everyone treats the fiction as real and worth caring about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Describe actions</strong> – Go beyond “I attack.” Show how you move, what you say, what it looks like.</li>
        <li><strong>React to outcomes</strong> – Let successes, partials, and failures change how your character feels and behaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Build on details</strong> – When someone adds a detail, treat it as a resource, not background noise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the GM says the tavern smells of smoke, decide whether that makes your character nostalgic, uneasy, or
        indifferent. Small reactions accumulate into a rich portrayal.
      </p>

      <h3 id="making-meaningful-choices">Making Meaningful Choices</h3>
      <p>
        Meaningful choices are grounded in both character and situation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask, “What would my character do here?” and take that seriously, even if it is risky.</li>
        <li>Embrace consequences; partial successes and failures are fuel for interesting scenes.</li>
        <li>Consider how your decision opens space for other characters to respond or grow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You always retain control over your character’s actions and internal life. The GM brings the world; you
        decide how your character engages with it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="roleplaying-in-different-scenes">Roleplaying in Different Scenes</h3>

      <h4 id="roleplaying-in-combat">Combat Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        Combat is not only about tactics. It is also about how your character responds to danger:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use your choices of Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, and Defend/Withdraw to show priorities—who you protect,
          what risks you accept.</li>
        <li>Let Conditions and Resolve Clocks show up in your description. Stagger when hurt, hesitate when
          <em>Frightened</em>, push through when it matters.</li>
        <li>React when others suffer; a quiet character might become decisive when an ally falls.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="roleplaying-in-social-scenes">Social Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        In social scenes, your words and posture matter. You do not have to improvise every line, but try to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Summarize what your character says, focusing on tone and intent.</li>
        <li>Show emotion through description—body language, pauses, eye contact.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to NPC reactions and adjust your approach when the fiction calls for it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="roleplaying-in-exploration">Exploration Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        Exploration scenes reveal what your character notices and cares about when there is no immediate threat.
        Curious characters poke at details; cautious ones check exits; idealists look for people to help. Use
        these scenes to reinforce who you are outside of crisis.
      </p>

      <h3 id="player-tips-for-success">Player Tips for Success</h3>
      <p>
        A few practical habits make play smoother and more satisfying. Taking five minutes before a session to
        review your character, their current situation, and what you want to pursue can make a big difference.
        Jotting simple notes—names, locations, promises—keeps threads from slipping away between games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many players find it helpful to set a small, personal goal each session: “I want to confront my mentor,”
        “I want to make peace with that faction,” or “I want to learn more about the vanished relay line.” These
        goals give the GM something to weave into scenes and help you decide what your character pushes toward
        when choices arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tactically, you do not need to master every rule to play well. Focus on three questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How can we use terrain and Tags to our advantage in this scene?</li>
        <li>Is anyone carrying dangerous Conditions we should clear or mitigate?</li>
        <li>What can I do this turn to make an ally’s next action stronger?</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – A Simple Plan</strong><br />
        Before a session, a player notes that their character wants to repair trust with a contact they previously
        lied to. When the GM frames a scene at that contact’s workshop, the player leans into it—offering a sincere
        apology and a concrete favor. The GM rewards this with a small improvement in standing and a future lead.
        A few minutes of preparation turned a casual scene into a memorable character moment.
      </div>

      <h3 id="reading-the-table">Reading the Table</h3>
      <p>
        Good play also means paying attention to the table, not just the fiction. When another player leans
        forward, takes notes, or lights up at a detail, that is a cue that this thread matters to them. When
        someone has been quiet for a while, you can create space for them with a simple question: “What is your
        character doing while this happens?”
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM’s descriptions are cues as well. If they linger on a Tag, repeat an NPC’s name, or mention a small
        oddity twice, it usually means that element is important. If you are unsure what a scene is about, ask
        briefly out of character: “What is at stake here?” Clarity helps everyone aim their actions in the same
        direction.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Inviting Someone In</strong><br />
        During an investigation scene, two players are debating theories while a third stays quiet. One of the
        debaters pauses and says, “You grew up in this district—what do you think is really going on?” The quiet
        player’s character suddenly becomes central to the scene, sharing local knowledge the others lacked. A
        small invitation shifted focus in a way that felt natural in the fiction.
      </div>

      <h3 id="spotlight-sharing-and-party-cohesion">Spotlight Sharing and Party Cohesion</h3>
      <p>
        Sharing spotlight keeps the game from becoming “the story of one character with supporting cast.” You do
        not need to track minutes of talk time, but it helps to be aware of patterns. If you have been at the
        center of the last few scenes, consider how your character might support others next—by asking for help,
        following someone else’s lead, or taking an assisting action instead of the decisive one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stepping forward and stepping back are both generous acts. Step forward when your character’s skills,
        history, or goals are central to the moment. Step back when someone else is in their focus scene and make
        their moment stronger with Set Ups, assistance, or simply by reacting in character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many tables like to create shared backstory—why the group is together, who they owe, what they have
        survived. These connections make it easier to care about one another’s scenes.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Supporting Someone Else’s Spotlight</strong><br />
        A session centers on another character’s estranged sibling arriving in town. Rather than trying to solve
        the sibling’s problems, the rest of the group plays into the situation: one offers quiet moral support,
        another runs interference with a suspicious faction, a third uses a Set Up action in a later conflict to
        give the spotlight character Advantage. Everyone gets to act, but the emotional core of the session stays
        with the sibling relationship.
      </div>

      <h3 id="working-with-the-gm">Working with the GM</h3>
      <p>
        The GM is your collaborator, not your opponent. They present the world, frame situations, and play NPCs.
        You bring your character’s perspective and choices. Good collaboration looks like:
      </p>
      <p>
        Share your character’s goals and interests so the GM knows what to put on screen. Ask clarifying
        questions when stakes or details are unclear; it is better to pause for thirty seconds than to play
        through a scene everyone misunderstood. When consequences land, treat them as prompts for new choices
        rather than reasons to pull back from the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        If something at the table is not working for you—tone, pacing, or content—say so. Adjusting together is
        part of collaborative play.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Sharing a Goal</strong><br />
        A player tells the GM between sessions, “I want my character’s missing mentor to matter this arc.” A few
        sessions later, clues about the mentor’s fate appear in a side investigation. Because the player shared
        that interest, the GM could weave it into existing plots rather than guessing what would land.
      </div>

      <h3 id="session-zero-and-safety">Session Zero and Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Before a campaign begins, many groups hold a session zero to set expectations:
      </p>
      <p>
        Use this time to talk about tone (cozy, gritty, heroic, horrific), the kinds of stories you want, and
        content that is off‑limits or should be handled gently. Agree on how you will pause or check in if
        something feels uncomfortable. A few minutes of honest conversation can prevent misunderstandings later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safety tools can be as simple as an agreement to pause and talk when someone feels uncomfortable, or as
        formal as a written set of lines and veils. The important part is that everyone feels they can speak up.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Using a Safety Pause</strong><br />
        Midway through a tense interrogation, a player says, “Can we pause a second?” The table briefly steps out
        of character and the player explains that a specific detail is hitting too close to home. The group and GM
        adjust the scene—keeping the stakes, changing the flavor—and continue in a way that everyone can enjoy.
      </div>

      <h3 id="handling-disagreements">Handling Disagreements</h3>
      <p>
        Disagreements will happen, both in character and out of character. To keep them from derailing play:
      </p>
      <p>
        First, separate character conflict from player conflict. It is fine for characters to argue fiercely or
        make incompatible choices; it is not fine for players to feel attacked or sidelined. If a plan discussion
        stalls or tempers rise, step briefly out of character and ask, “What do we each want from this scene?”
      </p>
      <p>
        If needed, the GM can frame the stakes and ask for a decision so the story can move: “If you split the
        party here, these risks apply; if you stay together, you miss this opportunity. Which do you prefer?”
        Once a choice is made, treat it as a shared direction and see where it leads.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Resolving a Plan Disagreement</strong><br />
        Two players argue in character about whether to confront a faction now or gather more evidence. After a
        few minutes, a third player says, “Let’s pause—what do we want as players?” They discover one wants a
        tense confrontation, another wants to see more investigation scenes. Together with the GM, they decide to
        stage a smaller confrontation that reveals new clues, giving both desires some space.
      </div>

      <h3 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing It All Together</h3>
      <p>
        Roleplaying and collaboration are what turn mechanics into stories. Use the tools in this chapter to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Portray characters who change over time.</li>
        <li>Support one another’s arcs and share spotlight.</li>
        <li>Work with the GM to shape a campaign that reflects everyone’s interests and boundaries.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The rules in earlier chapters tell you how to resolve actions. This chapter is your reminder that how you
        choose those actions—and how you respond to the results—is just as important.

        Part II explains the Skills and Proficiencies that give characters texture and focus, and collects key
        mechanical references used at the table. Skills represent what your character can reliably do under
        pressure; Proficiencies represent domains where their knowledge or training changes how the GM interprets
        the fiction. Extended Tags and Conditions, advancement options, and optional rules round out the
        mechanical toolkit.
      </p>
      <p>
        These chapters describe how to build and customize skill lists, how to group examples by Attribute and
        domain, and how to use mechanical references to tune campaigns. GMs and players can work together here to
        define new entries and options that fit the tone and needs of each table.

      <h2 id="skills-system-overview-heading">14. Skills System Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Skills are fiction‑first capabilities that define what your character can reliably do when the outcome is
        uncertain. They represent practiced competencies—from climbing a precarious cliff to negotiating a trade
        deal, from repairing relay equipment to navigating orbital traffic. This chapter explains what Skills
        represent, how they interact with Attributes and Checks, and how to choose and create Skills that fit
        your campaign.
      </p>

      <h3 id="what-skills-represent">What Skills Represent</h3>
      <p>
        Skills are not abstract numbers. They are grounded in your character’s experiences, training, and
        environment. A character with Stealth knows how to move quietly, read patrol patterns, and exploit
        shadows. A character with Persuasion understands how to frame requests, read social dynamics, and build
        rapport. When you roll a Skill Check, you are asking: “Given who this character is and what the situation
        is, can they accomplish this goal?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills always operate on the fiction‑first principle introduced earlier:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the fiction does not support an action, no roll happens.</li>
        <li>If the action is certain to succeed or fail given the situation, the GM simply describes the result.</li>
        <li>Only when uncertainty, consequence, and agency align does a Skill Check come into play.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – When a Skill Matters</strong><br />
        In a cozy neighborhood campaign, a character with Baking might roll to impress a skeptical community elder
        with a carefully prepared cake, gaining Advantage on future social scenes with that community. In a sci‑fi
        relay station, a character with Systems Diagnostics might roll to stabilize failing life support. Both are
        “skills,” but the way they appear in the fiction depends on the setting and the situation.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-and-attributes">Skills and Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        Skills and Attributes work together. Attributes describe broad tendencies—Might (MIG), Agility (AGI),
        Presence (PRE), and Reason (RSN). Skills sharpen those tendencies into specific competencies. A Check
        typically uses one Attribute and, when appropriate, one Skill that fits the declared intent and approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same Skill can pair with different Attributes depending on how you act:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using Stealth with AGI when you move quietly through a crowded market.</li>
        <li>Using Stealth with RSN when you plan a route that avoids patrol patterns entirely.</li>
        <li>Using Persuasion with PRE when you speak with emotional conviction.</li>
        <li>Using Persuasion with RSN when you construct a careful, logical argument.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This flexibility keeps Skills tied to the story rather than locked into fixed formulas. The GM chooses
        the Attribute that best matches your described approach, then checks whether a Skill meaningfully applies.
      </p>

      <h3 id="skill-categories">Skill Categories</h3>
      <p>
        To make it easier to navigate options, Skills are loosely grouped into broad categories. These categories
        are descriptive, not restrictive, and can overlap:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exploration</strong> – Perception, Wayfinding, Investigation, Climbing, Tinkering.</li>
        <li><strong>Social</strong> – Persuasion, Negotiation, Insight, Deception, Comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical</strong> – Medicine, Thievery, Hacking, Engineering, Forensics.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict</strong> – Melee Combat, Firearms, Tactics, Zero‑G Combat, Crowd Control.</li>
        <li><strong>Arcane or Supernatural</strong> – Arcana, Occult Lore, Ritual, Divination.</li>
        <li><strong>Wilderness and Environment</strong> – Survival, Animal Handling, Gardening, Foraging.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Chapters 15 and 17 provide example Skills grouped by Attribute and domain, with genre‑specific lists you
        can use as written or adapt to your setting.
      </p>

      <h3 id="reading-skill-entries">Reading Skill Entries</h3>
      <p>
        Each Skill entry in the reference chapters follows a consistent structure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name and category</strong> – The Skill’s name and where it fits (Exploration, Social, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Description</strong> – A fiction‑first explanation of what the Skill covers and how it feels in play.</li>
        <li><strong>Default actions</strong> – Common tasks and typical DC ranges (using the standard DC ladder).</li>
        <li><strong>Synergies</strong> – Tags, Conditions, or Proficiencies that make this Skill more effective.</li>
        <li><strong>Counters</strong> – Situations or Tags that hinder the Skill.</li>
        <li><strong>GM usage notes</strong> – Advice on when to call for rolls and how to interpret outcome tiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Example</strong> – A short worked example showing the Skill in context.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you read a Skill entry, start with the description and example. They tell you how it shows up in the
        fiction. Numbers and DCs come after.
      </p>

      <h3 id="choosing-skills">Choosing Skills at Character Creation</h3>
      <p>
        During Character Creation, you select a small set of Skills that define what your character reliably does
        under pressure. When choosing Skills, keep four questions in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Does this fit the genre?</strong> A haunted relay station game will see more use from
          Engineering and Occult Lore than from Tournament Jousting.</li>
        <li><strong>Does this fit my concept?</strong> A former smuggler might take Navigation, Streetwise, and
          Deception; a village healer might focus on Medicine, Gardening, and Comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Does this complement the group?</strong> If no one has Medicine or Tactics, consider covering
          that gap. Redundancy can be fun, but shared blind spots are risky.</li>
        <li><strong>Is this a Skill I want to lean into?</strong> Choose Skills you are excited to see in play; you
          can grow into new areas later.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Selecting Skills for a Concept</strong><br />
        A player creates Rami, a courier who once worked the telegraph lines in a canyon region. They choose
        Stealth, Systems Diagnostics, Wayfinding, and Mediation. Stealth and Wayfinding reflect years of moving
        through rough terrain unnoticed. Systems Diagnostics ties into relay maintenance. Mediation represents
        their habit of smoothing over disputes between outposts. The Skill list says as much about who Rami is as
        their attributes do.
      </div>

      <h3 id="creating-custom-skills">Creating Custom Skills</h3>
      <p>
        The provided Skill lists are starting points. If a Skill you want is missing, you and your GM can create a
        custom one. A good custom Skill has a clear scope, fits your genre, and gives the GM obvious hooks for
        scenes where it matters. “Social Media Savvy” might be perfect for a modern campaign but feel out of
        place in a low‑magic village game; “Wayfinding” makes sense across many genres.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you design a new Skill together, start by writing a short description in plain language. Decide what
        kinds of actions it covers, what typical difficulties feel like, and what situations make it shine or
        struggle. You do not need to list every possible use; two or three concrete examples are enough to anchor
        the Skill in play.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Defining a Custom Skill</strong><br />
        In a modern investigative campaign, the group adds <em>Digital Forensics</em> as a Technical Skill.<br />
        <em>Description:</em> Analyze digital devices, recover deleted data, and trace online activity.<br />
        <em>Default actions:</em> Recover deleted files (DC 14–18), trace a message’s origin (DC 16–20), detect
        tampering (DC 12–16).<br />
        <em>Synergies:</em> Networked or Surveillance Tags, relevant Proficiencies like Cybercrime.<br />
        <em>Counters:</em> Air‑gapped systems, encrypted drives, Alert adversaries.<br />
        The GM now has a clear sense of when and how to call for Digital Forensics Checks.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-proficiencies-tags-and-conditions">Skills, Proficiencies, Tags, and Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Skills rarely act alone. Proficiencies deepen them, Tags color the environment around them, and Conditions
        bend them out of shape. A Proficiency in a particular domain often makes related Skill Checks easier or
        safer. Tags such as <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Cramped</em>, or <em>Networked</em> tilt odds toward or away
        from certain Skills. Conditions like <em>Exhausted</em> or <em>Frightened</em> can narrow which approaches
        remain reasonable, even when you technically have the Skill.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Skill with Proficiency and Tags</strong><br />
        A character with the Systems Diagnostics Skill and the “Telegraph Instruments” Proficiency attempts to
        stabilize a failing relay in a canyon station. The scene has the Tags <em>Dim Light</em> and
        <em>Unstable</em> due to flickering lamps and tremors.<br />
        The GM decides the Proficiency lowers the effective DC and grants Advantage on RSN + Systems Diagnostics
        Checks. However, <em>Unstable</em> means failures may tick a “Structural Collapse” Clock. The Skill,
        Proficiency, and Tags combine to make the moment specific and tense.
      </div>

      <h3 id="using-the-skill-reference-chapters">Using the Skill Reference Chapters</h3>
      <p>
        The chapters that follow provide concrete Skill lists and examples. Chapter 15 groups Skills by Attribute
        and offers sample entries you can adopt or adapt. Chapter 17 does the same for Proficiencies, showing how
        they sharpen certain Skills or open new options in the fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not need to memorize every entry. When you create or advance a character, scan the parts that match
        your campaign’s tone and pick what supports your concept. During play, treat the lists as inspiration. If
        you describe an approach that fits the fiction, you and the GM can decide together which Skill applies,
        even if it is not on a printed menu.

      <h2 id="skills-reference-by-attribute-heading">15. Skills Reference</h2>

      <p>
        This chapter offers example Skills grouped by Attribute. It is not an exhaustive catalog. Instead, it
        shows the kinds of capabilities that naturally lean on Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Presence (PRE), and
        Reason (RSN), with short descriptions and sample uses. After each group, a few Skills are expanded into
        detailed entries that follow the structure described in the previous chapter.
      </p>

      <h3 id="skills-mig">Might (MIG) Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Might‑leaning Skills focus on strength, endurance, and direct physical effort. They often appear when you
        push, lift, resist, or endure things that would overwhelm most people. MIG Skills are not just about
        violence—they also cover hard labor, rescue work, and physically demanding crafts.

      </table>

      <h4 id="skill-athletic-movement">Athletic Movement — Exploration / Conflict (MIG)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Athletic Movement covers running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and other full‑body movement under pressure. Characters with this Skill know how to conserve momentum, balance speed and safety, and read terrain for opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Climbing rough surfaces, crossing gaps, sprinting through unstable ground, or swimming against a current. Routine efforts in good conditions might be DC 12–14; risky leaps in bad weather or climbs while encumbered may push DCs into the 16–20 range.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags like <em>Cramped</em> or <em>Unstable</em> make movement riskier, while secure anchor points or safety gear can justify Advantage. Conditions such as <em>Exhausted</em> or <em>Injured</em> often impose Disadvantage or raise effective DCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use this Skill when movement itself is the source of tension. Partial successes are good places to introduce new Tags or tick environmental Clocks—reaching the ledge but dislodging debris, for example.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Athletic Movement</strong><br />
        The group needs to cross between two rooftops before a patrol arrives. The gap is wide, the night is rainy, and the Tag <em>Slick</em> is in play. The GM calls for a MIG + Athletic Movement Check at DC 16. On a Full Success, the character clears the gap cleanly. On a Partial Success, they make it but knock tiles loose, adding <em>Unstable</em> to the landing roof and ticking a “Guards Alerted” Clock by one.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-agi">Agility (AGI) Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Agility‑leaning Skills emphasize precision, balance, reflexes, and fine control. They cover stealthy
        movement, delicate manipulation, and actions where timing and positioning matter more than raw power. AGI
        Skills often determine who moves first, who avoids danger, and who can operate safely in constrained or
        unstable environments.
      </p>

            <td><strong>Fine Manipulation</strong></td>
            <td>Delicate handwork under pressure—lockpicking, tools, instruments.</td>

            <td><strong>Ranged Technique</strong></td>
            <td>Accurate attacks or precise throws with ranged tools.</td>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4 id="skill-stealth-evasion">Stealth &amp; Evasion — Exploration / Conflict (AGI)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Stealth &amp; Evasion is the ability to move quietly, stay out of sight, and slip through gaps in attention. It includes reading patrol patterns, choosing routes, and using cover effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Crossing guarded spaces without being seen, hiding in cluttered environments, shadowing someone through a crowd, or breaking line of sight. DCs depend on alertness and environment: DC 12–14 for casual observation, 16–18 against active patrols or <em>Alert</em> Tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Tags like <em>Dim Light</em>, <em>Crowded</em>, or <em>Obscured</em> often support this Skill, granting Advantage or lowering effective DCs. <em>Alert</em>, <em>Surveillance</em>, or noisy gear can impose Disadvantage or raise DCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> When a Stealth Check fails, think about how the story changes—guards might become suspicious rather than immediately sounding alarms, or a partial reveal might create a tense chase instead of a static fight.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Stealth &amp; Evasion</strong><br />
        A character tries to slip past a checkpoint in a foggy yard at night. The Tags <em>Dim Light</em> and
        <em>Obscured</em> are present, but the guards are on <em>Alert</em>. The GM calls for an AGI + Stealth &amp;
        Evasion Check at DC 16, ruling that the helpful Tags and the <em>Alert</em> state balance out. On a Full
        Success, the character passes unseen. On a Partial, they get through but one guard notices footprints in
        the mud, ticking a “Suspicion Rising” Clock.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-pre">Presence (PRE) Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Presence‑leaning Skills are about influence, emotional resonance, and social navigation. They come to the
        forefront when your character speaks, negotiates, performs, or stands firm under social pressure. PRE
        Skills shape how NPCs and factions feel about you and how scenes change when you step in.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Insight &amp; Empathy</strong></td>
            <td>Reading people’s moods, motivations, and tells.</td>
            <td>Noticing when a witness is omitting something; sensing that a faction leader is more afraid than angry; spotting who in a crowd is truly listening.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4 id="skill-persuasion-appeal">Persuasion &amp; Appeal — Social (PRE)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Persuasion &amp; Appeal is the ability to convince others through argument, empathy, or shared interest. It helps you change minds or soften positions without deception.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Negotiating terms, calming frightened NPCs, or advocating for a course of action. Everyday requests might sit at DC 12–14; high‑stakes persuasion against resistant targets can reach DC 18–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Positive standing with a faction, prior favors, or supportive Tags (such as <em>Friendly</em> atmosphere) can justify Advantage or lower DCs. Deep grudges, conflicting goals, or a <em>Tense</em> Tag make success harder.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Use outcome tiers to adjust both content and tone of NPC responses. Partial successes might grant what the PCs want at a cost, such as obligations or strings attached.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Persuasion &amp; Appeal</strong><br />
        The characters ask a guild leader to delay a crucial shipment. The guild’s standing with them is
        <em>Neutral</em>, but they recently helped with a separate problem. The GM calls for a PRE + Persuasion
        Check at DC 16, noting that success means the delay is granted, while a Partial success means the delay
        comes with a promised favor the guild will collect later.
      </div>

      <h3 id="skills-rsn">Reason (RSN) Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Reason‑leaning Skills focus on analysis, memory, perception, and structured thinking. They shine when you
        sift clues, diagnose problems, plan ahead, or notice what others overlook. RSN Skills often drive
        investigation, engineering tasks, and long‑term strategies.
      </p>

      <h4 id="skill-investigation">Investigation — Exploration (RSN)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Investigation covers following leads, connecting evidence, and reconstructing events. Where Perception tells you what is present, Investigation helps you determine why and how.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Default actions:</strong> Analyzing a crime scene, comparing records for inconsistencies, or tracing the path of a missing person. Straightforward inquiries might be DC 12–14; complex puzzles or well‑hidden schemes push toward DC 18–22.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Synergies and counters:</strong> Access to records, helpful NPCs, or prior research can lower DCs or justify Advantage. Tags such as <em>Obscured</em>, <em>Hazardous</em> locations, or active Cover‑Up Clocks raise stakes and complicate interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GM usage notes:</strong> Treat Investigation Checks as steps in a process, not single all‑or‑nothing gates. Use Clocks to track progress toward understanding, and let partial results reveal some truths while leaving room for future discoveries—or mistakes.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example – Investigation</strong><br />
        The group examines a sabotaged relay hub. The GM sets a 6‑segment “Understand the Sabotage” Clock and
        calls for an RSN + Investigation Check at DC 14. A Full Success both advances the Clock and clearly links
        the damage to a particular toolset. A Partial advances the Clock but hints at two possible culprits,
        leaving ambiguity the group will need to resolve later.
      </div>

      <h3 id="mixing-attributes-and-skills">Mixing Attributes and Skills</h3>
      <p>
        These examples show where Skills most often lean, but they are not rigid assignments. In play, you will
        often mix Attributes and Skills in flexible ways: a MIG‑focused character might pair Investigation with
        physical intimidation, while a PRE‑focused character might use Systems &amp; Diagnostics to explain a
        problem convincingly to a nervous crowd. When in doubt, start from the fiction: what is your character
        doing, and which Attribute and Skill combination best captures that attempt.

      <p>
        Part III gathers extended mechanical references and GM tools. Here you will find deeper lists of Tags and

        Part IV is written primarily for Game Masters, but curious players are welcome to read it as well. These
