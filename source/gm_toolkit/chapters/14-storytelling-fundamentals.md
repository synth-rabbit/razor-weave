## Theme & Stakes {#theme--stakes}

Theme says what the story is about. Stakes say why it matters now. Pick a theme
for the current arc (e.g., debt, trust, identity) and name stakes each scene so
players know what a result will change.

GM usage

- Open scenes by stating immediate stakes
- Tie scene outcomes back to the arc theme in recaps

## Beats & Arcs {#beats--arcs}

Think in layers of scale and compress/expand to fit your session.

Beats of a scene

- Frame → Stakes → Check → Narrate → React (see Scene Structure)
- Each pass should change state or escalate pressure

Arcs

- Sequence (2–3 scenes) → Arc (3–6 sessions) → Campaign (multiple arcs)
- Track arc‑level clocks (progress and pressure) alongside scene clocks

GM usage

- At the end of a session, note which arc clocks changed
- If an arc stalls, introduce a reveal or new lever that touches the theme

## Setup → Payoff {#setup-→-payoff}

Plant details you can pay off later; reveal when players pull on them.

Tools

- Foreshadow: hint at dangers or opportunities; show signs before effects
- Callback: reprise an earlier element in a new context
- Revelation: turn unknowns into choices with cost and benefit

GM usage

- When you plant, write a sticky: what it suggests and how to pay it off
- Pay off via a meaningful check and visible state change

## Pacing Tools {#pacing-tools}

Shape tension. Give space to breathe between hard choices.

Patterns

- Tension Curve: alternate pressure with small relief; escalate per scene
- Montage: compress routine steps; highlight one meaningful choice
- Nested Clocks: run a set piece with a progress clock and 1–2 pressures

GM usage

- Cut early when a choice is made; resume on the next lever
- After a hard beat, offer a brief relief scene to reset spotlight and tone

## Tone & Genre Signals {#tone--genre-signals}

Tone comes from what you emphasize. Use mechanics to reinforce genre.

Signals

- Cozy: softer costs; partials lean toward obligations/favors over harm
- Mystery: reveal clues on Partials; advance suspicion/attention on Fails
- Action: emphasize space/tags and pressure clocks; celebrate bold setup

GM usage

- Say the tone at session zero; keep a short list of genre levers handy
- When tone drifts, restate stakes in genre language and adjust costs
