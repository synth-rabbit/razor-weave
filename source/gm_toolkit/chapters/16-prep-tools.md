## Prep Philosophy {#prep-philosophy}

Prep what moves play; improvise the rest. Focus on levers you can pull (tags,
conditions, clocks, terrain) and on clear stakes. Avoid writing plots; write
situations with objectives, pressure, and exits. Tie every prep item to a
question you will ask at the table: “What do you do?”

Principles

- Ready, not rigid: leave space for player solutions
- Visible state: clocks, tags, and conditions are prepared up front
- Fail‑forward: plan costs that advance the fiction, not roadblocks
- Small packets: one page per scene/encounter; link to references

## Session Prep Checklist {#session-prep-checklist}

- Agenda: recap, goals, timebox, safety check‑in
- Scenes: 2–4 likely scenes with objective, stakes, and levers
- Clocks: progress and pressure per scene (sizes 4/6/8)
- Space: 1–2 tags that matter; how to flip them
- NPCs: names, goals, leverage; a hook and a weakness each
- Encounters: roles/ranks/budget; counterplay and terrain synergy
- Tables: DC ladder cues; conditions/tags quick refs
- Exits: success/complication outcomes and transitions

## Templates {#templates}

Scene Template

- Title & Objective
- Stakes (Full/Partial/Fail); DC cues; Tags
- Clocks (progress/pressure) with sizes
- GM Prompts (opening, mid, exit); Exits/Transitions

NPC Template

- Name, Role, Goal, Leverage
- Hooks (easy/risky), Weakness, Tag/Condition
- GM Usage: how they move scenes forward

Encounter Template

- Roles/Ranks; Budget; Terrain Tags
- Signature Moves; Counterplay; Behavior Script
- Clocks and DC cues by lever

Clock Template

- Name & Type (progress/pressure)
- Size (4/6/8); Triggers; Clear/Spill conditions

### Example — Filled Scene Template {#example-filled-scene}

Title & Objective: Market Roof Chase — recover the ledger before the courier
escapes.

Stakes

- Full: you corner the courier on the rooftop and take the ledger
- Partial: you get the ledger but draw Heat 1 or suffer a minor condition
- Fail: the courier vanishes into the crowd; Reinforcements +2

DC cues & Tags

- Maneuver (DC 16) across Slick tiles; Set Up (DC 14) to create a shortcut
- Tags: Elevated, Slick; create Cover with a vendor’s canopy (Set Up)

Clocks

- Progress — Courier Cornered (6)
- Pressure — Heat (6)

GM Prompts

- Opening: “You spot the courier leap for the next roof — what do you do?”
- Mid: “Do you press the shortcut or regain footing?”
- Exit: “With the ledger in hand, do you slip away or chase the accomplice?”

## GM Workflow {#gm-workflow}

Before Session

- Review last log: clocks, tags, conditions, loose hooks
- Pick 2–3 scenes and 1 set piece; fill checklists/templates
- Print or lay out quick refs (DC ladder, tags/conditions)

During Session

- Open with recap; state today’s stakes and timebox
- Run the loop; pre‑state beats; keep clocks visible
- Rotate spotlight; keep passes short; close on change
- On Partial/Fail, move the fiction; offer clear levers

After Session

- Log what changed (clocks, tags, conditions, resources)
- Note new hooks, NPC shifts, and lingering risks
- Set a tentative first scene for next time

## Session Log & Debrief {#session-log--debrief}

Log Template

- Date, Session #, Agenda outcome
- Scene summaries (objective, result, new state)
- Updated clocks (progress/pressure) and campaign timers
- NPC changes (goals/leverage), new/cleared tags and conditions
- Next hooks (A/B options), first scene seed

Debrief Prompts

- What moved forward? What escalated?
- Which levers did players use? Which went untouched?
- What prep paid off? What can be lighter next time?
