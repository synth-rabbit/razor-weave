## Principles {#principles}

Playable first: build levers the table can use now. Prefer tags, clocks, and
hooks over lore. Show how to flip a lever; state costs for doing so.

GM usage

- Tag spaces with 1–2 meaningful properties; show clears/changes
- Add fronts via clocks to pace regional threats
- Write hooks as immediate choices, not backstory

## Region Template {#region-template}

- Name, Theme, One‑Sentence Pitch
- Travel Tags (2–3): e.g., Cramped Passes, Sudden Fog, Treacherous Roads
- Resources & Scarcities: what is abundant; what you must barter for
- Fronts (2–3): each with a clock (6/8) and a visible signal
- Factions Present: names, goals, leverage
- Landmarks: 3 places that matter (with a tag and a secret each)

Example — The Mistwell March

- Travel Tags: Sudden Fog, Slick Marsh Paths
- Fronts: Smuggling Ring (Heat); Sinking Keystones (Collapse)
- Landmarks: Toll Bridge (Fragile Cover; ledger hidden), Old Cloister (Dim;
  reliquary below), Orchard Edge (Obscuring; predators at dusk)

## Location Template {#location-template}

- Name, Purpose, Vibe
- Tags (2–3): what changes checks and tactics here
- Encounters (2): what scenes happen here (goal, pressure)
- Secrets (2): a payoff for setup or a risk to reveal
- Hooks (2–3): immediate reasons to visit now

GM usage

- Write how a tag flips: e.g., “Quiet alcove reduces Crowded DC by 2 once”
- Tie each secret to a lever the PCs can pull to reveal/payoff

## Faction Template {#faction-template}

- Name, Goal, Public Face, True Leverage
- Assets (3): people/gear/territory; what they risk to win
- Counterplay: how PCs undermine them (expose, split, bargain)
- Clock: Influence (6/8) with visible steps
- Hooks (2): what they want from PCs now (easy/risky)

Example — The Bookkeepers’ Circle

- Goal: launder contraband funds into public works
- Assets: loyal clerks; black‑ledger network; inspector favors
- Counterplay: seize ledgers; flip an inspector; freeze favors
- Influence: 0→6 (stingy rebates → civic projects)
- Hooks: Easy — small donation; Risky — alter a ledger entry

## Culture Template {#culture-template}

- Values (3): what matters most here
- Signals: names, styles, greetings (2–3 examples)
- Tensions: internal pressures; what changes if one resolves
- Customs: one generous act, one taboo, one festival

GM usage

- Use signals in description; let tensions become hooks and clocks

## Hooks Generator {#hooks-generator}

Roll or pick to seed a session. Combine a hook with a Location and a Faction.

- Protect a vulnerable thing (who wants it?)
- Deliver a thing across danger (who opposes you?)
- Unmask a liar in plain sight (who is fooled?)
- Break a deal that hurts someone (what is the price?)
- Recover a lost thing before a timer fills (who else seeks it?)
