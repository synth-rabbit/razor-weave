## Cozy Campaign Fundamentals {#cozy-campaign-fundamentals}

Cozy campaigns prioritize comfort, community, and low-stakes problem solving. The tone emphasizes
collaboration over competition, growth over conflict, and belonging over heroism. Stakes matter, but
consequences lean toward complication and obligation rather than harm and loss.

### What Makes a Campaign Cozy

Cozy campaigns focus on daily life, relationships, and community challenges. The world can have
danger, but it stays at the margins. The PCs create safety and belonging rather than fight to
survive.

Cozy elements:

- Stakes rooted in community needs, not life-or-death crises
- Conflict driven by misunderstanding, scarcity, or natural challenges
- Resolution through collaboration, creativity, and relationship building
- Tone that balances earnestness with gentle humor
- Setting that feels lived-in and improvable

Not cozy elements (to avoid or minimize):

- Violence as primary conflict resolution
- Betrayal or cruelty from trusted NPCs
- Irreversible loss or tragedy
- Prolonged tension without relief
- Mechanics that punish rather than complicate

### Stakes Without Violence

Cozy campaigns need stakes that matter without threatening harm. The key is making outcomes
meaningful to character identity, relationships, and community standing.

Cozy stakes examples:

- Will the harvest festival succeed? (community reputation)
- Can we convince the merchant to stay? (economic stability)
- Will we finish the renovation in time? (personal pride)
- Can we mediate the neighbor dispute? (social harmony)
- Will the recipe work for the competition? (creative validation)

GM usage:

- Frame stakes in terms of belonging and reputation, not survival
- Make failure create obligation or complication, not catastrophe
- Let successes build community resources and relationships
- Use stakes to showcase PC skills and character growth

### Community Focus

Cozy campaigns center on community as character. The town, village, or neighborhood has personality,
needs, and growth arcs. The PCs are embedded members, not passing adventurers.

Community elements:

- Recurring NPCs with goals, quirks, and relationships
- Communal spaces (market, tavern, square, workshop)
- Seasonal events and rituals that structure time
- Shared resources and collective challenges
- Reputation and social standing as progression

GM usage:

- Create 8-12 core NPCs with distinct voices and needs
- Map physical community spaces for consistent reference
- Use seasonal calendar to pace events and downtime
- Track community reputation as a clock or resource
- Let PCs shape community through projects and relationships

## Reframing Conflict {#reframing-conflict}

Cozy campaigns still need conflict, but it takes different forms. Reframe traditional obstacles into
social, economic, and environmental challenges that reward creativity over combat.

### Social Challenges

Social challenges arise from misunderstanding, incompatible needs, or resource competition. They
resolve through communication, compromise, and relationship building.

Social challenge types:

- Mediation: Two parties need help finding compromise
- Persuasion: Someone needs convincing to try something new
- Collaboration: Multiple parties must work together despite differences
- Reputation: PCs must prove themselves to skeptical community members
- Teaching: PCs help someone learn a skill or overcome fear

Example social challenge (mediation):

The baker and the miller are feuding over flour prices. The baker can't afford the increase, and the
miller needs to cover rising costs. Neither will compromise because of old grudges. The PCs must
mediate, find creative solutions, or help them remember why they were friends.

Possible resolutions:

- Negotiate bulk pricing that works for both
- Find additional revenue streams for the miller
- Organize community investment in the mill
- Facilitate a conversation about the original grudge
- Create a festival event that requires their cooperation

### Economic Challenges

Economic challenges involve resource management, trade, and sustainability. They reward planning,
creativity, and community cooperation.

Economic challenge types:

- Scarcity: Essential resource is limited or expensive
- Trade: Need to establish or maintain trade relationships
- Investment: Project requires collective resources
- Competition: Market or festival creates friendly rivalry
- Sustainability: Balance resource extraction with renewal

Example economic challenge (scarcity):

Winter came early, and the fishing boats can't reach the deep waters. The community needs protein
sources, but hunting would require entering the contested forest. The PCs must find alternative
solutions or negotiate access.

Possible resolutions:

- Establish mushroom farming in cellars
- Negotiate with forest wardens for limited access
- Trade with distant community for preserved fish
- Organize ice fishing on the frozen river
- Create protein alternatives from available crops

### Environmental Challenges

Environmental challenges come from weather, geography, or natural cycles. They require adaptation,
preparation, and respect for natural forces.

Environmental challenge types:

- Weather: Storm, drought, or cold threatens community
- Terrain: Geography limits access or creates hazards
- Wildlife: Animals cause problems but aren't monsters
- Seasons: Seasonal changes require preparation
- Natural events: Floods, fires, or earthquakes

Example environmental challenge (weather):

Unexpected rain threatens the apple harvest. The fruit must be picked and stored within three days
or it will rot. The community needs all hands, but several families are dealing with flooded homes.
The PCs must coordinate response to both crises.

Possible resolutions:

- Organize community harvest with shifts for home repair
- Devise quick-drying storage methods
- Prioritize and accept partial loss with dignity
- Use magical or technological solutions (if available)
- Turn crisis into opportunity for cider making or preserves

GM usage:

- Mix challenge types to create variety
- Layer challenges (economic crisis caused by environmental event)
- Let failures create new challenges, not dead ends
- Reward creative solutions with community recognition
- Use challenges to showcase different PC skills

## Downtime as Primary Play {#downtime-as-primary-play}

Traditional TTRPGs treat downtime as bookkeeping between adventures. Cozy campaigns make downtime
the main play mode. Projects, relationships, and routines become the content.

### Project Play

Projects give structure to downtime. They're multi-session endeavors that require planning, resource
gathering, and collaboration. They provide tangible progress and community impact.

Project types:

- Construction: Build or renovate structure (workshop, garden, community center)
- Creation: Craft item or art piece (tapestry, recipe collection, memorial)
- Event planning: Organize celebration or competition (festival, wedding, tournament)
- Problem solving: Address community need (irrigation system, school curriculum)
- Exploration: Map area or document nature (local ecosystem, historical sites)

Project structure:

1. Conception: PCs identify need or desire
2. Planning: Determine steps, resources, and timeline
3. Execution: 2-4 sessions of play focused on project tasks
4. Complication: Obstacle requires adaptation or help
5. Completion: Deliver project and see community impact

Example project (construction):

The PCs decide to build a greenhouse to extend the growing season. They need to gather materials,
design the structure, recruit help, and construct it before winter. The project spans four sessions
with social, economic, and practical challenges.

Session breakdown:

- Session 1: Planning and material gathering (negotiate with woodcutter, trade for glass)
- Session 2: Site preparation and foundation (environmental challenge: rocky soil)
- Session 3: Construction (social challenge: coordinate volunteers)
- Session 4: Completion and celebration (showcase success, plan first crops)

GM usage:

- Use clocks to track project progress (6-8 segments)
- Introduce one complication per project to create drama
- Let failures delay or modify projects, not cancel them
- Celebrate completions with community events
- Make projects create new opportunities or challenges

### Relationship Development

Relationships are both motivation and content. Track bonds with NPCs, develop them through play, and
let them create story hooks and mechanical benefits.

Relationship mechanics:

- Bond clocks: Track relationship development (stranger → acquaintance → friend → close friend)
- Relationship moves: Special interactions available at different bond levels
- Favor economy: Help others, receive help in return
- Community standing: Reputation affects initial NPC disposition
- Relationship conflicts: Incompatible bonds create interesting choices

Example relationship development:

The PCs befriend the elderly herbalist. Initially wary (stranger), she warms after they help repair
her fence (acquaintance). They become friends when they spend downtime learning about local plants.
At close friend level, she shares family recipes and teaches rare herb identification.

Mechanical benefits by bond level:

- Acquaintance: Willing to trade fairly, answer basic questions
- Friend: Offers favors, shares useful information, provides hospitality
- Close friend: Provides significant help, teaches skills, trusts with secrets
- Confidant: Becomes narrative anchor, provides home base, supports risky choices

GM usage:

- Create relationship clocks for 6-8 core NPCs
- Advance clocks through play, not just time
- Let bonds create obligations and story hooks
- Use relationship conflicts for drama (help friend A or friend B?)
- Make high-level bonds provide mechanical advantages

### Routine and Ritual

Cozy campaigns benefit from routine. Recurring activities create rhythm, showcase character
development, and provide reliable comfort between challenges.

Routine examples:

- Morning market: Weekly shopping and gossip gathering
- Communal meals: Regular tavern nights or potlucks
- Skill practice: Ongoing training or craft work
- Seasonal activities: Harvest, planting, celebrations
- Personal rituals: Journaling, prayer, creative work

GM usage:

- Establish 2-3 recurring routine scenes
- Use routines to deliver information and hooks naturally
- Show time passing through seasonal routine changes
- Let players describe their character's routines for depth
- Skip routines during crisis; return to them for relief

## Soft Failure Costs {#soft-failure-costs}

Cozy campaigns need consequences without cruelty. Failures create complications, obligations, and
embarrassment rather than injury, death, or irreversible loss.

### Failure Types for Cozy Play

Reframe traditional failure costs into cozy-appropriate consequences. The pattern: something goes
wrong, but it can be addressed or accepted.

Cozy failure costs:

- Obligation: You succeed, but now you owe someone
- Complication: Problem isn't solved, it's different now
- Delay: Solution takes longer than expected
- Embarrassment: Social cost, not mechanical penalty
- Resource cost: Spend money, time, or material
- Relationship strain: Someone is disappointed, not betrayed
- Limited success: Get what you need, not what you want

Example failure resolutions:

Traditional: You fail to pick the lock. The door stays shut. (dead end)

Cozy: You can't pick the lock, but the innkeeper's daughter saw you trying. She'll let you in if you
help her with a delivery tomorrow. (obligation)

Traditional: You fail to convince the merchant. She refuses your offer. (negotiation ends)

Cozy: She's not convinced, but she respects the attempt. She'll think about it overnight, giving you
time to find a sweetener or address her real concern. (delay + new information)

### Partial Successes in Cozy Games

Partial successes (typically 5-6 on outcome rolls) work perfectly for cozy play. They deliver
success with complication, creating interesting choices without harsh consequences.

Partial success patterns:

- Success with cost: You get what you want but spend more resources
- Success with obligation: You succeed but create future commitment
- Success with complication: You solve this problem but create another
- Success with revelation: You succeed but learn something concerning
- Limited success: You get part of what you want

Example partial successes (harvest festival planning):

- Roll to organize volunteers: Partial success. Everyone agrees to help, but the wealthier families
  expect recognition in the program. Do you honor that or risk offense?
- Roll to secure musicians: Partial success. The traveling band will perform, but they need lodging
  and meals for a week. Can the community absorb the cost?
- Roll to prepare feast: Partial success. You gather enough food, but the centerpiece dish requires
  an ingredient you don't have. Do you adapt or send someone on a side quest?

GM usage:

- Treat partials as "yes, but" rather than "yes, and"
- Make complications interesting, not punishing
- Give players choice in how they address complications
- Use complications to create new story hooks
- Let some complications resolve naturally over time

### Embracing Failure as Story

Cozy campaigns can embrace failure as story fuel. Things going wrong creates memorable moments,
character development, and community bonding.

Failure as story techniques:

- Comedic failure: Disaster played for humor, not trauma
- Learning moment: Failure teaches skill or humility
- Bonding opportunity: Shared struggle brings people together
- Pivot point: Failure opens new, better path
- Character moment: How PCs handle failure reveals character

Example failure as story:

The PCs try to bake a cake for the elder's birthday. They fail spectacularly: the cake collapses,
the kitchen is covered in flour, and they're running out of time. Instead of tragedy, this becomes
comedy: they improvise a "deconstructed cake" dessert, the elder finds it hilarious, and the
community remembers this as the year of "the disaster cake." Future baking attempts become running
gags.

GM usage:

- Signal when failure will be comedic vs serious
- Give PCs room to roleplay response to failure
- Let community NPCs react with support, not judgment
- Use failures to create inside jokes and callbacks
- Make spectacular failures more memorable than successes

## Social and Exploration Emphasis {#social-and-exploration-emphasis}

Cozy campaigns shift mechanical focus from combat to social and exploration challenges. Rebalance
difficulty, rewards, and progression to support this focus.

### Rebalancing Difficulty

If combat is rare, social and exploration challenges need to carry equivalent weight. Make them
mechanically interesting and meaningfully consequential.

Rebalancing techniques:

- Increase social challenge complexity (opposed rolls, multi-party negotiations)
- Make exploration reveal information and resources, not just terrain
- Use success tiers to add texture to social outcomes
- Create social "set pieces" equivalent to combat encounters
- Reward social and exploration creativity mechanically

Example social set piece (mediation):

The feuding baker and miller (from earlier) require structured negotiation. Each has a position
clock (stubbornness) and an opening clock (willingness to compromise). The PCs make social rolls to
advance opening clocks while preventing position clocks from filling. Success means resolution;
failure means escalation. Complications might require side quests or creative solutions.

Mechanical structure:

- Baker position clock: 4 segments (fills if he refuses compromise)
- Baker opening clock: 6 segments (fills when he's willing to negotiate)
- Miller position clock: 4 segments
- Miller opening clock: 6 segments
- PC actions: Social rolls to advance opening or reduce position
- Complications: Each failed roll advances one position clock
- Resolution: Both opening clocks fill before either position clock

### Exploration Rewards

Make exploration inherently rewarding. Discovery provides community benefits, personal satisfaction,
and story hooks.

Exploration reward types:

- Resources: Find useful materials or food sources
- Knowledge: Learn history, geography, or natural patterns
- Relationships: Meet new NPCs or communities
- Beauty: Experience aesthetic wonder (valid reward in cozy games)
- Secrets: Discover hidden places or forgotten knowledge

Example exploration reward:

The PCs explore the old forest to gather mushrooms. They succeed and find enough mushrooms for the
week. As a bonus (or on a critical success), they discover a grove of ancient trees with unusual
properties. The trees produce edible bark with medicinal qualities. This discovery:

- Provides new resource for community
- Creates trade opportunity with distant communities
- Raises questions about who planted the trees
- Offers quiet, beautiful location for future scenes
- Suggests deeper mysteries if PCs want to investigate

GM usage:

- Reward exploration with tangible and aesthetic benefits
- Let discoveries create new options and story hooks
- Make exploration feel productive, not risky
- Use exploration downtime to develop character
- Balance guided and open exploration

### Social Progression

In combat-focused games, PCs progress by defeating threats. In cozy games, PCs progress through
relationships, reputation, and community standing.

Social progression mechanics:

- Reputation tracks by faction or community
- Relationship bonds that unlock new abilities or knowledge
- Community roles that provide authority and responsibility
- Social conditions that represent standing (Respected, Beloved, Trusted Expert)
- Favor banks that track obligations and debts

Example social progression:

A PC focuses on cooking and hospitality. Over time, they:

- Gain reputation as skilled cook (mechanical bonus to cooking rolls)
- Develop bonds with NPCs who share recipes and ingredients
- Take on role of feast coordinator (authority to make decisions)
- Earn condition Beloved Host (advantage on hospitality social rolls)
- Build favor bank (many NPCs owe them meals or help)

These social advancements create mechanical benefits and story opportunities equivalent to
combat-focused progression.

## Celebration and Ritual {#celebration-and-ritual}

Cozy campaigns thrive on celebration. Festivals, meals, and rituals provide structure, emotional
peaks, and community bonding. They're both content and reward.

### Festivals and Events

Festivals mark time, create stakes, and showcase community. They're natural story arcs: preparation,
execution, and aftermath.

Festival structure:

1. Announcement: Event is coming (2-4 sessions away)
2. Preparation: Organize logistics, assign roles, gather resources
3. Complication: Something threatens or challenges the event
4. Execution: The event happens; PCs participate and adapt
5. Aftermath: Celebrate success, address consequences, set up next arc

Festival types:

- Seasonal: Harvest, planting, solstice, equinox
- Commemorative: Founding day, historical event, memorial
- Lifecycle: Wedding, coming-of-age, funeral, birth celebration
- Competition: Cook-off, crafts fair, athletic games, talent show
- Religious/spiritual: Blessing, pilgrimage, holy day, ritual

GM usage:

- Plan one major festival per 4-6 sessions
- Use festivals to introduce challenges naturally
- Let PCs take leading roles in preparation and execution
- Make festivals showcase PC skills and relationships
- Use festival outcomes to shift campaign direction

### Communal Meals

Meals are powerful cozy play tools. They gather characters, facilitate conversation, and mark
important moments. Treat them as scenes, not transitions.

Meal scene structure:

1. Preparation: Who cooks? What do they make? (opportunity for rolls)
2. Gathering: Who attends? What's the mood?
3. Sharing: The meal itself; spotlight rotates for conversation
4. Purpose: Information sharing, relationship development, or planning
5. Ending: How does the meal conclude? What's next?

Meal types:

- Daily routine: Tavern breakfast, communal dinner
- Celebration: Festival feast, wedding banquet, birthday dinner
- Negotiation: Business meal, diplomatic dinner
- Comfort: Meal after crisis, grief support, welcome-home dinner
- Impromptu: Picnic, field meal, travel rest

Example meal scene:

The community gathers for a harvest feast. The PCs helped prepare and are guests of honor. During
the meal:

- The elder toasts the PCs and shares a story about past harvests
- The merchant privately mentions trade opportunities
- The blacksmith's child shows the PCs a drawing of them
- Someone starts singing, and the table joins in
- The innkeeper offers free lodging for the winter

The scene accomplishes: recognition, information sharing, relationship development, emotional
satisfaction, and arc setup.

GM usage:

- Use meals to deliver information naturally
- Let food quality and presentation matter mechanically
- Make shared meals create or strengthen bonds
- Use meal scenes for pacing relief
- Spotlight different PCs through meal conversations

### Seasonal Rhythms

Seasons provide natural structure for cozy campaigns. Each season brings activities, challenges, and
tone shifts.

Seasonal framework:

Spring:

- Activities: Planting, cleaning, building
- Tone: Hopeful, energetic, new beginnings
- Challenges: Preparation, resource allocation, planning

Summer:

- Activities: Tending, traveling, gathering
- Tone: Abundant, social, adventurous
- Challenges: Maintenance, weather, competition

Autumn:

- Activities: Harvesting, preserving, celebrating
- Tone: Grateful, busy, reflective
- Challenges: Time pressure, resource management, preparation

Winter:

- Activities: Crafting, storytelling, planning
- Tone: Cozy, intimate, patient
- Challenges: Scarcity, isolation, endurance

GM usage:

- Mark season changes with significant events
- Let seasonal activities drive session content
- Use seasonal tone to vary pacing and mood
- Create seasonal traditions that recur each year
- Track time through seasonal cycles rather than calendar days

## Worked Example: Harvest Festival Crisis {#worked-example-harvest-festival-crisis}

This example demonstrates cozy conflict, project play, and community focus across a three-session
arc.

### Scenario Setup

The village of Millbrook holds an annual harvest festival. This year, the PCs are helping organize
it. Three days before the festival, the main barn collapses in a storm. The barn stored decorations,
competition supplies, and feast preparations. The community must decide: cancel the festival, scale
it down, or find creative solutions.

Cozy elements:

- Stakes: Community morale and tradition, not survival
- Conflict: Resource scarcity and time pressure, not violence
- Resolution: Collaboration, creativity, and adaptation

### Session 1: Crisis and Planning

Frame: The morning after the storm, the PCs survey the damage. The barn is unsafe, its contents
destroyed or damaged. The village gathers to decide what to do.

Initial community mood: Demoralized. Many villagers suggest canceling. The elder remains silent,
leaving the decision to the community.

PC opportunity: The PCs can advocate for continuing the festival. This requires a social challenge
(convince the community) or a practical challenge (present viable alternative plan).

Example player approaches:

- Inspiring speech: Social roll to rally community spirits
- Practical solution: Present alternative location and scaled plan
- Emotional appeal: Invoke tradition and past festivals
- Collaborative brainstorm: Facilitate planning session

Outcome (assuming Partial success on social rally):

The community agrees to try, but enthusiasm is low. Several key volunteers are skeptical. The PCs
must deliver on their promise or lose community trust.

This introduces two clocks:

- Festival preparation clock: 8 segments (must fill by festival day)
- Community enthusiasm clock: 6 segments (must maintain above 3)

Planning session:

The community identifies needs:

- Alternative venue for feast and competitions
- Replacement decorations and supplies
- Revised event schedule
- Coordinated volunteer effort
- Managing expectations (this year will be different)

The PCs assign themselves tasks and recruit help. This creates structure for the next two sessions.

### Session 2: Preparation and Complications

The PCs spend this session executing their plan. Each PC focuses on one major task, creating
opportunities for varied gameplay.

Example PC tasks:

PC 1: Secure alternative venue (the old mill)

- Challenge: The mill needs cleaning and basic repairs
- Approach: Physical work with Investigation/Craft rolls
- Success: Mill becomes charming rustic venue
- Partial: Mill works but lacks capacity; need outdoor backup
- Failure: Mill unusable; must find another solution
- Advance festival prep clock: 2 segments on success, 1 on partial

PC 2: Gather replacement decorations (forest gathering)

- Challenge: Need natural decorations quickly
- Approach: Exploration and Craft rolls
- Success: Gather beautiful autumn materials
- Partial: Materials sufficient but need community help crafting
- Failure: Materials inadequate; must buy expensive replacements
- Advance festival prep clock: 2 segments on success, 1 on partial

PC 3: Organize volunteers (social coordination)

- Challenge: Convince skeptical volunteers to commit
- Approach: Social rolls with different NPCs
- Success: Volunteers commit enthusiastically
- Partial: Volunteers commit but need constant encouragement
- Failure: Volunteers agree reluctantly; risk of no-shows
- Advance enthusiasm clock: 2 segments on success, 1 on partial

PC 4: Secure feast supplies (economic/trade challenge)

- Challenge: Replace lost food stores
- Approach: Negotiation and resource management
- Success: Gather supplies within budget
- Partial: Gather supplies but create obligations
- Failure: Must scale down feast significantly
- Advance festival prep clock: 2 segments on success, 1 on partial

Complication (mid-session):

The blacksmith, a key volunteer, sprains his wrist and can't help with the competition equipment.
This threatens both clocks: festival prep and community enthusiasm.

PC response options:

- Find replacement help (social challenge)
- Modify competitions to need less equipment (creative solution)
- PCs take on equipment work personally (skill challenge)
- Convince blacksmith's apprentice to step up (mentorship moment)

Resolution depends on PC approach. Success preserves both clocks. Partial advances festival prep but
reduces enthusiasm. Failure reduces enthusiasm significantly.

Session 2 ends with most tasks complete but both clocks incomplete. Festival is tomorrow.

### Session 3: Festival Day

The festival arrives. The prep clock is at 6/8 segments (not perfect), and enthusiasm is at 4/6
(cautiously optimistic). The day proceeds in phases.

Morning: Setup

The PCs coordinate final preparations. This is a montage with one group check to advance the prep
clock to 8/8.

Success: Everything comes together beautifully. Enthusiasm advances to 5/6.
Partial: Most things work; one area is improvised. Enthusiasm stays at 4/6.
Failure: Setup is rough; festival starts with visible problems. Enthusiasm drops to 3/6.

Midday: Competition and Crisis

The competitions begin (baking, crafts, children's games). This is the dramatic high point.
Introduce one final complication:

Crisis: The traveling merchant arrives with her wagon, expecting to sell at the festival. But no one
budgeted space or coordinated with her. She's a regular vendor, and refusing her damages the
village's trade reputation.

PC response:

- Negotiate with merchant (find compromise)
- Make space quickly (improvise solution)
- Turn crisis into opportunity (special merchant competition category)
- Handle social fallout (apologize and promise future inclusion)

This final challenge determines enthusiasm clock final state and merchant relationship outcome.

Afternoon: Feast and Resolution

The feast begins at the mill. The PCs have honored roles (toasts, serving, storytelling). This scene
showcases success.

Feast scene beats:

- Elder thanks community for resilience and PCs for leadership
- Villagers share favorite moments from the day
- Someone toasts "the festival we almost didn't have"
- Music and dancing (optional PC participation)
- Quiet moment where PCs see community joy restored

Enthusiasm clock resolution:

- 5-6 segments: Complete success; community is revitalized; PCs gain Beloved standing
- 3-4 segments: Mixed success; festival happened but tradition strain; PCs gain Respected standing
- 1-2 segments: Partial success; festival was awkward but meaningful; PCs must rebuild trust

### Aftermath and Hooks

The arc concludes, but consequences ripple forward:

Immediate outcomes:

- PCs gain reputation (mechanical bonus to future social rolls)
- Villagers remember specific PC contributions
- Community bonds strengthen or strain based on outcomes
- The mill becomes new festival venue (environmental change)

Future hooks planted:

- Merchant relationship (trade opportunity or obligation)
- Barn rebuilding project (next arc possibility)
- Villagers ask PCs to lead spring planting festival
- Traveling performers mention festival success in distant town
- Someone suggests making this "the year we changed" a tradition

GM usage:

This arc demonstrates:

- Cozy stakes (tradition and morale, not survival)
- Soft failure costs (obligation, complication, not tragedy)
- Project structure with clocks
- Community focus with ensemble participation
- Celebration as content and reward
- Layered challenges (social, practical, creative)
- Meaningful success without violence

Adapt this structure for other cozy arcs: construction project, community crisis, seasonal
preparation, or relationship-focused story.
