## Epic Fantasy Fundamentals {#epic-fantasy-fundamentals}

Epic fantasy campaigns emphasize heroism, grand stakes, and mythic conflicts. The PCs are
exceptional individuals facing world-changing threats. The tone balances earnest heroism with real
cost, spectacle with intimacy, and triumph with sacrifice.

### What Makes Fantasy Epic

Epic fantasy operates at heightened scale. Stakes involve kingdoms, not villages. Threats endanger
civilizations, not individuals. Heroes possess or develop extraordinary capabilities. The tone
embraces the mythic while grounding it in relatable human emotion.

Epic fantasy elements:

- Stakes: Threats to nations, worlds, or fundamental orders
- Scale: Journeys across continents, battles of armies, ancient powers
- Heroism: PCs are chosen, destined, or exceptional by deed
- Magic: Present, powerful, wondrous, and costly
- Morality: Clear good and evil, though nuanced in execution
- Spectacle: Dramatic set pieces, legendary creatures, grand locations

Not epic elements (or use sparingly):

- Mundane concerns: Daily survival, economic struggles
- Ambiguous morality: Every faction equally corrupt
- Power scarcity: Magic is rare and weak
- Small scale: Threats stay local, victories unnoticed
- Realism: Gritty survival mechanics, harsh consequences for heroism

### Stakes and Scale

Epic fantasy stakes must feel proportional to the heroes' power and the campaign's scope. Start with
personal stakes, escalate to communal, then regional, then world-threatening.

Stakes escalation pattern:

1. Personal: Protect loved ones, prove worth, discover identity
2. Communal: Save village, defend allies, preserve culture
3. Regional: Unite kingdoms, prevent war, defeat warlord
4. World: Stop ancient evil, prevent apocalypse, restore cosmic balance

GM usage:

- Begin campaigns at personal scale; earn epic scale
- Make epic stakes feel tangible through personal connections
- Use NPCs to ground world-scale threats in human cost
- Let players choose when to escalate from personal to epic
- Ensure victories at each scale feel meaningful

### Heroism and Tone

Epic fantasy tone celebrates heroism without becoming parody. Heroes are admirable but flawed.
Victories require sacrifice. Power comes with responsibility. The world is worth saving.

Heroic tone elements:

- Earnest emotion: Characters express hope, fear, love without irony
- Admirable goals: PCs want to protect, save, or restore
- Meaningful sacrifice: Victories cost something valuable
- Hope against darkness: The world is dark but not without light
- Legendary moments: Scenes of triumph, revelation, and spectacle

Tone techniques:

- Take PC goals seriously; let them be heroic
- Balance triumph with cost; victories aren't free
- Use NPCs to express gratitude and hope
- Create scenes of beauty and wonder amid darkness
- Let PCs inspire others through action and example

GM usage:

- Signal heroic tone in Session Zero; discuss player comfort
- Contrast darkness with light to avoid grimdark
- Celebrate PC victories with in-world recognition
- Make sacrifices meaningful but not crippling
- Use downtime to showcase positive impact of heroism

## Heroic Journey Structure {#heroic-journey-structure}

Epic fantasy naturally follows the heroic journey (monomyth). While not every campaign needs all
stages, the structure provides pacing and dramatic arc for multi-session epics.

### Journey Stages

The heroic journey has key stages. Not all campaigns use every stage, but awareness helps structure
epic arcs.

Classic stages adapted for TTRPGs:

1. Ordinary World: Establish baseline, show what's at stake
2. Call to Adventure: Introduce quest or threat
3. Refusal/Hesitation: Acknowledge cost and risk
4. Meeting Mentor: Gain guidance, training, or equipment
5. Crossing Threshold: Leave safety, commit to quest
6. Tests and Allies: Build party, develop skills, face challenges
7. Approach to Crisis: Preparation for major conflict
8. Ordeal: Central crisis where heroes face death or transformation
9. Reward: Gain power, knowledge, or MacGuffin
10. Road Back: Return journey with pursuit or complication
11. Resurrection: Final test applying lessons learned
12. Return with Boon: Deliver victory and transform home

### Adapting the Journey

TTRPG heroic journeys differ from solo hero tales. The party is collective hero, player agency
drives pacing, and the journey may cycle multiple times within a campaign.

TTRPG adaptations:

- Ordinary World: Session Zero or introductory session
- Call and Threshold: First arc establishes quest
- Tests and Allies: Middle arcs build power and relationships
- Ordeal and Reward: Major arc climaxes with advancement
- Return and Resurrection: Campaign finale and epilogue

Multiple journey cycles:

- Minor cycle: Single quest (2-4 sessions)
- Major cycle: Campaign arc (8-12 sessions)
- Epic cycle: Full campaign (20+ sessions)

GM usage:

- Use journey structure for arc planning, not strict scripting
- Let players drive pacing through choices
- Create threshold moments where PCs commit to escalation
- Place ordeals at natural progression points
- Make returns celebratory; show impact on home

### Threshold Moments

Thresholds are points of no return. They commit PCs to a course of action with escalating stakes.
They're dramatic moments that shift campaign tone and scale.

Threshold characteristics:

- Voluntary: PCs choose to cross; not railroaded
- Consequential: Crossing changes PC status or world state
- Dramatic: Marked by significant scene or revelation
- Escalating: Each threshold raises stakes and scope

Example thresholds:

- Accepting the quest from the dying king (commitment)
- Entering the forbidden forest despite warnings (departure)
- Claiming the legendary sword (power and responsibility)
- Allying with former enemies against greater threat (moral complexity)
- Confronting the villain rather than fleeing (heroic choice)

GM usage:

- Plan 2-3 major thresholds per campaign arc
- Present thresholds as clear choices, not hidden paths
- Allow consequences to be telegraphed, not surprising
- Use thresholds to advance time or change tone
- Celebrate threshold crossings with mechanical or narrative rewards

## Quest Design {#quest-design}

Epic fantasy thrives on quests: structured goals with clear objectives, obstacles, and rewards.
Quests provide direction while allowing player agency in execution.

### Quest Types

Epic fantasy quests follow classic patterns. Mix quest types to vary gameplay and tone.

Primary quest types:

- Fetch: Retrieve object, person, or knowledge
- Rescue: Save someone from danger or imprisonment
- Destroy: Eliminate threat, break curse, close portal
- Discover: Find location, truth, or solution
- Protect: Defend person, place, or object from attack
- Unite: Gather allies, forge alliances, reconcile enemies

Quest structure:

1. Assignment: Who gives the quest and why
2. Objective: Clear goal with success conditions
3. Obstacles: Challenges between PCs and objective
4. Opposition: Active forces working against PCs
5. Reward: Mechanical and narrative payoff
6. Consequences: What happens if PCs fail or refuse

Example quest (Fetch):

Assignment: The wizard's apprentice asks the PCs to retrieve the Sunstone from the ancient temple.
The wizard needs it to sustain the magical barrier protecting the city.

Objective: Reach the temple, navigate its trials, claim the Sunstone, return it to the wizard within
seven days.

Obstacles: Monster-infested forest, temple puzzles and guardians, the Sunstone's weight makes fast
travel impossible.

Opposition: A rival faction also seeks the Sunstone to break the barrier and invade the city.

Reward: Payment, the wizard's gratitude, and a protective charm. City remains safe.

Consequences: If PCs fail or refuse, the barrier weakens, and the city faces invasion.

### Quest Chains and Branching

Single quests work for short arcs. Epic campaigns benefit from quest chains: linked quests that
build toward larger goals. Allow branching for player agency.

Quest chain structure:

- Primary quest: Overarching campaign goal (stop the dark lord)
- Secondary quests: Steps toward primary goal (gather allies, find artifacts)
- Tertiary quests: Steps toward secondary goals (prove worth to potential ally)
- Side quests: Optional content with rewards but not required for main arc

Branching techniques:

- Parallel paths: Multiple approaches to same goal
- Optional quests: Extra challenges with bonus rewards
- Consequence branches: Earlier choices affect later quests
- Failure paths: Failed quests create different challenges, not dead ends

Example quest chain (stop the dark lord):

Primary: Defeat the dark lord before he opens the Shadow Gate

Secondary A: Retrieve the Sunblade (only weapon that can harm him)

- Tertiary: Gain the temple guardian's blessing to claim the blade
- Tertiary: Purify the blade using sacred fire

Secondary B: Rally the divided kingdoms to march on the Shadow Gate

- Tertiary: Prove the dark lord's threat to skeptical kings
- Tertiary: Mediate peace between two feuding kingdoms

Secondary C: Discover the ritual to close the Shadow Gate permanently

- Tertiary: Find the lost grimoire in the sunken library
- Tertiary: Convince the archmage to share forbidden knowledge

Side quest: Help refugee town escape dark lord's forces (rewards: allies, supplies, information)

GM usage:

- Present primary quest early; reveal secondary quests through play
- Allow PCs to pursue quests in any order (within logic)
- Make some quests optional; let PCs choose priorities
- Use failed quests to create complications, not blocks
- Track quest progress with clocks

### Quest Rewards

Epic fantasy rewards should feel legendary. Balance mechanical benefits with narrative impact and
social recognition.

Reward types:

- Gear: Magic items, legendary weapons, artifacts
- Power: New abilities, progression, special training
- Allies: NPCs or factions who aid the PCs
- Knowledge: Secrets, maps, or tactical information
- Status: Titles, recognition, or authority
- Resources: Money, territory, or magical components
- Story: Revelations that advance plot or deepen lore

Reward pacing:

- Minor quest: Useful gear or information
- Major quest: Legendary item or significant power
- Arc quest: Transform PC capabilities or world state

GM usage:

- Match reward to quest difficulty and stakes
- Make legendary rewards feel earned through challenge
- Let rewards create new capabilities or story hooks
- Use social rewards to make heroes feel heroic
- Delay some rewards for dramatic timing (legendary sword breaks curse only after side quest)

## Magic Systems and Narrative {#magic-systems-and-narrative}

Epic fantasy treats magic as wondrous, powerful, and narratively significant. Magic shapes the
world, drives plot, and represents themes. It's never mundane.

### Magic as Wonder

Magic should inspire awe. Even common magic feels special. Legendary magic transforms reality. Make
magic visually and narratively distinctive.

Wonder techniques:

- Describe magic vividly: sensory details, environmental effects
- Give magic personality: different casters create different effects
- Make magic costly: energy, material, or narrative cost
- Limit magic access: not everyone can cast; not all spells are known
- Use magic to showcase setting: magic reflects world's nature

Example magic descriptions:

Generic: "The wizard casts fireball. Roll damage."

Epic: "The wizard traces a sigil of flame in the air. The symbol pulses once, twice, then explodes
outward in a roaring sphere of azure fire. The heat washes over you from twenty paces away. Roll
damage."

Generic: "You heal using your paladin powers."

Epic: "You press your hand to the wound. Golden light spills between your fingers, warm as summer
sun. The torn flesh knits together, leaving only a faint silver scar. Your deity's favor surrounds
you like an embrace."

### Magic as Cost

Epic magic should require sacrifice. The most powerful effects demand something meaningful: time,
materials, relationships, or personal cost.

Cost types:

- Material: Rare ingredients consumed in casting
- Time: Rituals require hours, days, or weeks
- Health: Casting drains vitality or causes conditions
- Social: Magic use has political or religious consequences
- Moral: Powerful magic requires questionable choices
- Risk: Failed casting creates dangers

Example costs:

- The resurrection ritual requires a diamond worth a kingdom's ransom and three days of
  uninterrupted casting
- The scrying spell reveals the target's location but alerts them to being watched
- The protective ward lasts one month, then the caster gains condition Exhausted until next full
  rest
- The battle magic wins the fight but causes collateral damage to civilians
- The forbidden summoning grants power but draws the attention of planar entities

GM usage:

- Scale cost to power: world-changing magic demands world-changing cost
- Let players choose costs when options exist
- Make costs narratively interesting, not just mechanical
- Use costs to create story hooks and consequences
- Respect magic's power through meaningful limitations

### Magic and Theme

Magic reinforces campaign themes. Design magical systems, items, and creatures to resonate with core
ideas.

Theme-magic connections:

- Theme of sacrifice: Magic requires personal cost or loss
- Theme of corruption: Powerful magic tempts or transforms
- Theme of connection: Magic links people, places, or times
- Theme of knowledge: Magic comes from learning and understanding
- Theme of nature: Magic flows from environment and cycles

Example (corruption theme):

The campaign explores power's corrupting influence. Magic reflects this:

- Powerful spells leave visible marks on casters (eyes change color, skin develops runes)
- Artifacts offer great power but whisper temptations
- The dark lord was once a hero who embraced forbidden magic
- NPCs who use too much magic become withdrawn and paranoid
- The most powerful PC spell option comes with corruption clock

GM usage:

- Choose 1-2 campaign themes in Session Zero
- Design 2-3 magic elements that reinforce themes
- Use magic consequences to explore themes
- Let PCs choose how to engage with thematic magic
- Make theme-magic connections explicit in descriptions

## Epic Combat and Set Pieces {#epic-combat-and-set-pieces}

Epic fantasy combat should feel legendary: large scale, high stakes, dynamic terrain, and heroic
moments. Combat is spectacle and story beat, not just mechanics.

### Epic Combat Elements

Epic combat differs from standard encounters through scale, complexity, and narrative weight.

Epic combat characteristics:

- Scale: Large numbers of combatants or massive creatures
- Terrain: Dynamic, hazardous, or fantastical battlefields
- Stakes: Outcomes affect story arc, not just immediate survival
- Phases: Combat evolves through stages with changing conditions
- Cinematic moments: Opportunities for spectacular actions
- Narrative integration: Combat advances plot or reveals character

Combat vs Encounter:

Standard encounter: PCs fight bandits on a road.

Epic encounter: PCs defend the city gate against an invading army while the wizard completes a
ritual to raise protective wards. The gate will fall in 10 rounds. Enemy siege engines bombard the
walls. Civilians flee through the combat zone. Victory requires holding the gate, not killing every
enemy.

### Set Piece Design

Set pieces are planned epic encounters with multiple elements, phases, and dramatic beats. They're
the climactic battles that define arcs.

Set piece components:

1. Location: Distinctive battlefield with tactical features
2. Objectives: Goals beyond "defeat all enemies"
3. Phases: Combat evolves as conditions change
4. Hazards: Environmental dangers and opportunities
5. Secondary threats: Multiple challenges requiring coordination
6. Cinematic moments: Opportunities for heroic actions
7. Stakes clock: Pressure timer representing consequences

Set piece structure:

- Phase 1: Initial engagement, establish stakes and terrain
- Phase 2: Complication (reinforcements, hazard, revelation)
- Phase 3: Escalation (boss appears, terrain changes, stakes increase)
- Phase 4: Resolution (final push, objective achieved or failed)

Example set piece (bridge defense):

Location: Ancient stone bridge over a chasm. Bridge is 100 feet long, 20 feet wide. Crumbling edges,
central keystone, defensive barriers.

Objectives:

- Primary: Hold the bridge for 12 rounds (let allies evacuate)
- Secondary: Prevent enemies from destroying the keystone
- Tertiary: Evacuate wounded soldiers

Phases:

- Phase 1 (rounds 1-4): Orc warband charges bridge; standard combat
- Phase 2 (rounds 5-8): Orc shaman begins ritual to shatter keystone; PCs must interrupt or counter
- Phase 3 (rounds 9-12): Troll emerges from chasm; terrain begins crumbling; final desperate stand

Hazards:

- Crumbling edges: Move carelessly, make Agility check or fall
- Keystone destruction: If ritual completes, bridge collapses in 3 rounds
- Chasm: Falling means death unless rescued

Stakes clock: Evacuation (8 segments, advances each round; must fill to save allies)

GM usage:

- Design 2-3 set pieces per campaign arc
- Telegraph set pieces one session ahead
- Make objectives clear before combat starts
- Use phases to create drama and pacing
- Allow creative solutions beyond "fight harder"
- End with narrative consequences, not just XP

### Cinematic Combat Actions

Epic combat rewards spectacular actions. Encourage players to attempt legendary feats beyond
standard attacks.

Cinematic action types:

- Environmental: Use terrain dramatically (chandelier swing, avalanche trigger)
- Heroic: Protect allies through sacrifice or bold positioning
- Tactical: Execute complex multi-character maneuvers
- Narrative: Actions that advance story (speech during combat, claiming artifact)
- Spectacular: Physics-defying or magical displays

Encouraging cinematic actions:

- Describe environment with tactical detail
- Reward bold actions with advantage or reduced difficulty
- Allow Rule of Cool for genre-appropriate stunts
- Use Success with Consequence for risky attempts
- Make cinematic actions advance stakes or clocks

Example cinematic actions:

Standard: "I attack the troll."

Cinematic: "I run toward the troll, slide between its legs while slashing its tendons, then vault
onto its back using my momentum."

Standard: "I cast shield on myself."

Cinematic: "I see the dragon inhale. I leap in front of the wizard and raise my shield, channeling
every ounce of divine power into a barrier. The dragon fire hits me first."

GM usage:

- Ask "How do you do it?" to prompt cinematic description
- Reward creative action mechanically when appropriate
- Use cinematic actions as inspiration for complications
- Let players narrate success when they earn it
- Make combat memorable through action, not just math

## Mythic Threats and BBEG Design {#mythic-threats-and-bbeg-design}

Epic fantasy needs epic villains. The Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG) drives the campaign arc, opposes the
heroes, and represents what's at stake. Design them to be memorable, threatening, and worth
defeating.

### Threat Tiers

Epic campaigns escalate through threat tiers. Early threats introduce danger. Mid-campaign threats
challenge heroes. Final threats endanger the world.

Threat tier structure:

Tier 1 (Local): Threatens community or region

- Scale: Bandit lord, local monster, corrupt official
- Arc length: 2-4 sessions
- Resolution: Defeat or drive off threat

Tier 2 (Regional): Threatens kingdom or multiple communities

- Scale: Warlord, dragon, powerful cultist
- Arc length: 6-10 sessions
- Resolution: Major battle or quest completion

Tier 3 (World): Threatens civilization or reality

- Scale: Dark lord, ancient evil, planar entity
- Arc length: 12-20 sessions
- Resolution: Epic confrontation, legendary quest

Campaign threat progression:

- Open with Tier 1 threat (establish tone and stakes)
- Introduce Tier 2 threat as Tier 1 resolves (escalation)
- Reveal Tier 3 threat behind Tier 2 (the real enemy)
- Resolve Tier 3 threat as campaign finale

GM usage:

- Don't start with world-ending stakes; earn them
- Connect lower-tier threats to higher-tier threats
- Let early victories matter even as stakes escalate
- Use threat tiers to pace power progression
- Make each tier defeat feel complete before escalating

### BBEG Design

The BBEG is the campaign's primary antagonist. They should be memorable, motivated, and mechanically
challenging. Design them in layers: identity, motivation, methods, and minions.

BBEG design components:

Identity:

- Who are they? (background, power source, appearance)
- What makes them distinctive? (personality, abilities, aesthetic)
- Why are they formidable? (power, resources, intelligence)

Motivation:

- What do they want? (goal)
- Why do they want it? (motivation)
- What will they sacrifice for it? (commitment)

Methods:

- How do they pursue their goal? (strategy)
- What resources do they command? (minions, magic, territory)
- What are their strengths and weaknesses? (tactical profile)

Minions and Structure:

- Who serves them? (lieutenants, armies, creatures)
- Why do others follow? (fear, belief, payment)
- How is their organization structured? (hierarchy, specialization)

Example BBEG (Tier 3):

Identity: Lord Malachar, the Ashen King. Once a noble wizard-prince who sought to prevent
catastrophe. Now an undead sorcerer-lord clad in blackened armor, crowned with iron thorns. Commands
necrotic magic that withers life.

Motivation: Believes the world's cycle of suffering must end. Plans to open the Shadow Gate and
merge the material world with the Shadowfell, creating a realm without pain, emotion, or life.
Genuinely believes this is mercy.

Methods: Conquered three kingdoms using undead armies. Establishing ritual sites to weaken the
barrier between worlds. Recruiting desperate people with promises of peace. Uses spies and
infiltrators to sabotage resistance.

Minions:

- The Pale Hand: Elite undead knights, his most trusted lieutenants
- Cultists: Living followers who believe in his vision
- Shadow mages: Wizards corrupted by Shadowfell magic
- Undead armies: Endless troops raised from conquered lands
- Double agents: Placed within resistance organizations

Weaknesses:

- The Sunblade can permanently destroy his undead form
- His ritual requires seven sites; disrupting them delays his plan
- His humanity still exists buried deep; appeals to past may reach him
- Overconfident; believes himself inevitable
- Underestimates power of hope and living alliances

### Reveals and Escalation

Epic BBEGs benefit from gradual revelation. Start with minions and rumors, escalate to
confrontations, build to final battle.

Revelation structure:

1. Rumors and signs: PCs hear about threat (sessions 1-2)
2. Minion encounters: PCs fight BBEG's forces (sessions 3-6)
3. Lieutenant confrontations: PCs battle BBEG's champions (sessions 7-10)
4. Direct encounter: PCs meet BBEG but can't win yet (session 11-12)
5. Preparation: PCs gather power to match BBEG (sessions 13-16)
6. Final confrontation: PCs challenge BBEG at full power (sessions 17-20)

Escalation techniques:

- Each victory reveals more about BBEG
- BBEG responds to PC actions (countermoves)
- BBEG's plan progresses on countdown clocks
- Personal stakes develop (BBEG threatens PC bonds)
- Moral complexity emerges (BBEG's motivation revealed)

GM usage:

- Introduce BBEG early through reputation and minions
- Let PCs face BBEG before final battle (establish threat)
- Use countdown clocks to show BBEG's progress
- Make BBEG's motivation understandable if not sympathetic
- Give BBEG memorable traits (voice, appearance, phrases)
- Plan BBEG's response to major PC victories

### Countdown and Fronts

BBEGs pursue active plans on timelines. Use countdown clocks and fronts to represent BBEG progress
and create urgency.

Countdown structure:

- 8-12 segment clock representing BBEG's ultimate goal
- Advance clock on session milestones or when PCs don't interfere
- Clock completion triggers campaign crisis (gate opens, ritual completes, army marches)
- PCs can delay or reverse clock through action

Example countdown (Shadow Gate opening):

- 0 segments: BBEG begins plan; PCs unaware
- 3 segments: First ritual site established; local area shows effects
- 6 segments: Three sites active; regional darkness spreading
- 9 segments: Six sites active; barrier weakening; undead surge
- 12 segments: All seven sites active; gate opens; campaign crisis

Front structure (parallel threats):

Primary front: BBEG's ritual (countdown clock)

Secondary fronts:

- Military: Undead armies conquer territories (region control clock)
- Infiltration: Spies undermine resistance (sabotage clock)
- Recruitment: Cult grows in desperate areas (follower clock)

GM usage:

- Show clock progress to create urgency
- Let PC victories reverse or delay clocks
- Use secondary fronts to create varied challenges
- Make clock states visible in world (darkness spreads, undead increase)
- Allow campaign to continue if main clock completes (crisis, not failure)

## Worked Example: Dragon Siege Arc {#worked-example-dragon-siege-arc}

This example demonstrates epic fantasy structure, quest design, and set piece combat in a 4-session
arc.

### Arc Setup

The ancient red dragon Skaravex has awakened after centuries of slumber. She's claiming the mountain
kingdom of Ironpeak as her territory. The king has called for heroes to drive her off or slay her.
The PCs answer the call, joining other adventurers seeking glory and reward.

Epic elements:

- Scale: Kingdom-level threat, legendary creature
- Stakes: Thousands of lives, territorial sovereignty
- Heroism: PCs must prove themselves worthy of dragon-slaying
- Quest structure: Clear objective with multiple approaches

Arc structure:

- Session 1: Arrival and investigation
- Session 2: Preparation and first confrontation
- Session 3: Quest for advantage
- Session 4: Final battle

### Session 1: Arrival and Investigation

Frame: The PCs arrive at Ironpeak's capital city. Refugees flood the streets. The dragon has
destroyed three mining villages and established a lair in the mountain. The king summons the PCs to
the war council.

War council scene:

Key NPCs present:

- King Tormund: Desperate but resolute; wants to protect his people
- General Kara: Pragmatic military leader; believes fighting is suicide
- Archmage Venn: Older wizard; knows dragon lore and weaknesses
- Captain Rodric: Young officer; survived dragon attack; traumatized
- Other adventurers: Rival party seeking same glory

Information revealed:

- Skaravex is ancient and enormously powerful
- She's establishing lair in old dwarven fortress in the mountain
- She attacks anyone approaching her territory
- Traditional weapons barely scratch her scales
- The kingdom lacks resources for prolonged defense
- Refugees will starve if siege continues

The king presents options:

- Direct assault: March army to dragon's lair (likely suicide)
- Siege: Wait and prepare defenses (civilians suffer)
- Negotiation: Offer tribute to leave (kingdom impoverished)
- Champions: Send heroes to slay dragon (risky but possible)

PC choice: The PCs volunteer as champions. The king accepts but requires proof they can survive the
dragon. First test: Rescue survivors from a recent attack and gather intelligence.

Investigation and rescue mission:

The PCs travel to the most recently destroyed village. This is a horror-tinged investigation scene
showing dragon devastation.

Clues discovered:

- Core clue 1: The dragon is collecting metal, especially gold and iron
- Core clue 2: Dragon attacked when miners breached dwarven vault
- Core clue 3: Survivors report the dragon spoke, demanding "what was stolen"

Rescue challenge: Survivors trapped in collapsed mine. PCs must navigate unstable tunnels, avoid
toxic gas, and rescue civilians before dragon returns.

Session ends: PCs return with survivors and information. Archmage Venn theorizes: The dragon is
seeking something specific from the dwarven vault. This provides an advantage opportunity.

### Session 2: Preparation and First Confrontation

The PCs plan their approach. The archmage offers knowledge:

Dragon weaknesses:

- Ancient dragons resist most magic but are vulnerable to legendary weapons
- Red dragons are arrogant and can be goaded into mistakes
- Skaravex hasn't flown in the open yet (possibly injured or protecting something)
- Dragons can be bargained with if you have leverage

Preparation options:

The PCs choose how to prepare (multiple sessions possible; example uses one):

Option A: Seek legendary weapon (the Sunblade)

- Quest: Travel to temple, prove worth, claim weapon
- Benefit: Weapon can pierce dragon scales
- Cost: 2 sessions, dangerous quest

Option B: Discover what dragon seeks (investigate dwarven vault)

- Quest: Enter dangerous vault, find what dragon wants
- Benefit: Leverage for negotiation or trap opportunity
- Cost: 1 session, unknown dangers

Option C: Rally allies (gather forces and prepare battlefield)

- Quest: Convince neighboring kingdoms to send aid
- Benefit: Army support, better tactical position
- Cost: 1 session, diplomatic challenge

The PCs choose Option B (investigate vault).

Vault exploration:

The PCs enter the dwarven vault beneath the destroyed village. It's a dungeon exploration with
puzzles, traps, and ancient guardians.

Key discoveries:

- The vault contained the "Crown of the Mountain," an artifact
- Legend says the crown grants mastery over stone and metal
- The dragon didn't steal the crown; miners did before dragon attacked
- The crown is now in the capital, in the royal treasury
- The dragon will destroy the capital to reclaim it

First confrontation:

As PCs exit the vault, Skaravex arrives. This is a narrative encounter, not full combat. The PCs
cannot win but can impress or negotiate.

Dragon encounter structure:

- Round 1: Dragon lands, demands crown, gives PCs chance to speak
- Round 2: PCs respond (fight, negotiate, or flee)
- Round 3: Dragon reaction (respect, anger, or dismissal)
- Round 4: Dragon leaves (if impressed) or attacks (if angered)

Example outcome (negotiation):

PCs: "We know you seek the crown. The miners stole it, not the king. We can return it if you spare
the kingdom."

Dragon: "You dare bargain with Skaravex the Immortal? You are bold, mortals. Bring me the crown
before three suns set, or I will burn your stone halls to ash." (Flies away)

This creates countdown: 3 days (sessions) to decide and act.

### Session 3: Crown Dilemma and Quest

The PCs return with information and the dragon's ultimatum. This creates a complex choice:

Options:

1. Return crown to dragon (spares kingdom, but loses powerful artifact)
2. Keep crown and prepare for battle (kingdom at risk, but retain power)
3. Use crown as trap (lure dragon into ambush with crown as bait)
4. Seek compromise (offer tribute plus help finding other artifacts)

Each option has mechanical and narrative consequences. The PCs debate and choose.

Example choice: Use crown as trap.

The PCs propose a plan: Claim they'll return the crown in a ceremony at a prepared battlefield. Use
the crown to lure Skaravex into terrain favorable to the defenders. Spring the trap during
negotiation.

Preparation montage:

The PCs coordinate defenses with General Kara. This is a montage covering:

- Terrain modification: Prepare battlefield with ballista, barriers, and magic circles
- Force positioning: Place soldiers, mages, and artillery
- Crown preparation: Archmage Venn creates crown-based trap (magical binding)
- Contingencies: Evacuation plans if fight goes badly

This creates tactical advantages for the final battle but doesn't guarantee victory.

Moral complication:

Captain Rodric privately tells PCs his fear: "If this fails, you've just enraged the dragon with
betrayal. She'll massacre the entire kingdom for the insult. Are you certain you can win?"

This reinforces stakes and lets PCs reconsider. Their commitment to the plan defines their heroism.

### Session 4: Epic Battle

The day arrives. The dragon approaches the prepared battlefield (a valley with defensible
positions). The PCs, royal forces, and the archmage are ready.

Set piece structure:

Location: Stone valley with raised platforms, defensive walls, ballista positions, central plaza
with crown (trap bait).

Objectives:

- Primary: Defeat or drive off Skaravex
- Secondary: Protect the archmage while he activates crown trap
- Tertiary: Minimize allied casualties

Phases:

Phase 1 - Negotiation and Trap (rounds 1-3):

- Skaravex lands in plaza, approaches crown
- PCs attempt negotiation (stall while archmage prepares)
- Archmage triggers crown trap (binding spell)
- Trap partially succeeds: Dragon is weakened but not bound
- Dragon roars betrayal; combat begins

Phase 2 - Aerial Assault (rounds 4-7):

- Dragon takes flight, enraged
- Breathes fire across battlefield (area damage)
- Ballistas fire (clock: 6 segments to ground dragon)
- PCs must coordinate attacks while protecting allies
- Dragon destroys one ballista position

Phase 3 - Grounded Combat (rounds 8-11):

- Ballista clock fills; dragon crashes to ground
- Full combat: PCs vs wounded but deadly dragon
- Dragon uses tail, claws, and bite; area hazards
- Crown trap pulses: dragon takes damage each round (time pressure on dragon)
- Allied soldiers harass dragon, create openings for PCs

Phase 4 - Desperation or Victory (rounds 12+):

- If PCs are winning: Dragon attempts to flee; final push to prevent escape
- If PCs are losing: Dragon offers parley; negotiate from weakness
- Resolution: Dragon defeated, driven off, or bargain struck

Example resolution (victory):

The PCs focus fire on the dragon's wounded wing. A PC makes heroic attack (cinematic: leaps from
ballista platform onto dragon's back, drives legendary sword into weak point). Dragon roars,
thrashes, collapses.

Final choice: Kill or spare?

- Kill: Dragon slain; kingdom safe; PCs are legendary heroes; but dragon's knowledge is lost
- Spare: Dragon swears oath to leave and never return; PCs gain ancient ally; but kingdom fears
  dragon's return

PCs choose spare. Dragon acknowledges their strength: "You have proven yourselves worthy. The crown
is yours. I shall seek my treasures elsewhere. We are not enemies, champions. Remember this when
darkness comes."

Dragon flies away, wounded but alive.

### Aftermath

Victory celebration:

- King Tormund throws feast in PCs' honor
- PCs are granted titles and lands
- The Crown of the Mountain is entrusted to them (legendary item)
- General Kara offers them military commissions
- Archmage Venn invites them to study ancient magic
- Citizens cheer them as dragon-slayers

Long-term consequences:

- The kingdom recovers; refugees return home
- PCs' reputation spreads (advantage on social rolls in region)
- The dragon's warning about "darkness" foreshadows next arc
- Rival adventuring party is jealous; potential future conflict
- Dwarven descendants arrive, seeking to reclaim their vault and crown

GM usage:

This arc demonstrates:

- Epic stakes (kingdom survival) rooted in personal choice
- Quest structure with multiple approaches
- Moral complexity (betray dragon, spare or kill)
- Set piece combat with phases and objectives
- Cinematic moments and heroic choices
- Meaningful consequences and recognition
- Hook for future arc (dragon's warning)

Adapt this structure for other epic quests: siege defense, ancient evil awakening, or planar threat.
