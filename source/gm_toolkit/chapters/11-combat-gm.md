## Expansion Plan {#expansion-plan}

- Integrate core mechanics into a GM‑facing procedure for fast, fair combat.
- Add 2–3 worked beats (alley ambush, bridge fray, rooftop chase) with DC/tiers
  and tag usage.
- Provide a micro‑checklist for live use (ordering, call stakes, apply tags,
  narrate beats).

## Order & Spotlight {#order--spotlight}

### Ordering Modes {#ordering-modes}

- Conversational: ask “Who acts?”; rotate spotlight; break ties by danger/sense
- Popcorn: current actor names next; alternate sides; prevents alpha strike
- Hybrid: key beats have fixed order; between beats use conversational

Popcorn phrasing (example): “You’re up, then name who acts next.” Rotate across
sides to spread momentum.

Group Checks: Majority / All‑Must‑Succeed / Leader‑with‑Help (advantage dice up
to +2). Contests: both roll; higher total wins; ties are Partial by default.

## Action Types & Adjudication {#action-types--adjudication}

### Core Actions {#core-actions}

- Strike: contest vs defender or passive DC (14 + defense bonus)
- Maneuver: shove, trip, disarm, reposition; on Partial trade space/position
  for safety
- Set Up: create advantage or reduce DC; often applies tags/cover
- Defend/Withdraw: change position/effect; clear a minor tag; break contact

Adjudication: Pre‑state tier beats; use DC ladder (12/14/16/18/20/22); fiction
may grant Advantage/Disadvantage.

### Micro Example — Withdraw Clears Suppressed {#micro-withdraw}

You are Suppressed behind Fragile cover. On your turn, choose Withdraw: fall
back to sturdier crates (change position), clear Suppressed, and give up the
shot this pass. Next pass, a Set Up from an ally can restore a safe angle.

## Terrain, Tags, and Conditions {#terrain-tags-and-conditions}

Cover as Tag: Fragile vs Solid; Partial often degrades Fragile. Elevation,
Dim/Obscuring, Slick/Cramped: name the lever; explain its effect on
DC/Advantage. Conditions (Bleeding, Exhausted, Restrained) impose clear state
changes with obvious clears (first aid, time, leverage).

## Pacing with Clocks {#pacing-with-clocks}

Progress (wear down a notable foe or secure objective) vs Pressure
(reinforcements, collapse, fire spread). On Partial, prefer filling Pressure; on
Crit, consider ticking both. Use 4/6/8 segments based on tempo.

GM cue: On Partial, prefer ticking a pre‑stated pressure clock or degrading
Fragile cover rather than denying progress outright.

## Resolve without HP (Options) {#resolve-without-hp-options}

Resolve Clocks (by threat): T1:2–3, T2:4, T3:6, T4:8, T5:10 — filling breaks
will/position/gear. Morale & Breaks: end fights when objectives met or
opposition collapses. End early if the fiction makes continued rolling
redundant.

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

- Alley Ambush (modern)
- Bridge Fray (fantasy)
- Rooftop Pursuit (mystery)

Outline Details

- Alley Ambush: tags (Dim, Crowded); foes (T2 skirmisher + T1 thugs); examples
  of Set Up/Strike/Maneuver; Partial ticks Reinforcements; cover degrades.
- Bridge Fray: tags (Cramped, Slick); Troll (resolve clock 4); show Shove risk
  and group check to rush the gate.
- Rooftop Pursuit: tags (Elevated, Obscuring); contests for leaps,
  leader‑with‑help coordination; Partial splits team briefly; Fail triggers
  stumble clock.
