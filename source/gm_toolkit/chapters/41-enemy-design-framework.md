# Chapter 10: Enemy Design Framework {#gm-enemy-design-framework}

Enemies with motivations, weaknesses, and tactics create memorable encounters. This chapter provides frameworks for designing opposition that challenges players without reducing threats to stat blocks.

## Enemy Design Philosophy {#enemy-design-philosophy}

Enemies are characters with goals, fears, and methods. A goblin skirmisher isn't "20 HP with a knife"—they're a scrappy survivor using hit-and-run tactics because they know they can't win a fair fight. A corporate executive isn't "high social stats"—they're protecting quarterly earnings and their own position through legal threats and hired muscle.

Design from fiction first: What does this enemy want? What are they afraid of? How do they pursue goals given their capabilities? Mechanics follow from these answers.

## Core Components {#core-components}

### Motivation {#enemy-motivation}

Why does this enemy oppose the PCs? Common motivations:

**Resources**: Territory, food, treasure, or power they want to protect or acquire.

**Ideology**: Beliefs that conflict with PC goals—religious fervor, political conviction, or moral certainty.

**Fear**: Defending against perceived threats, protecting loved ones, or avoiding worse consequences.

**Orders**: Following commands from superiors, bound by duty or compulsion.

**Nature**: Acting according to instinct or fundamental being—predators hunt, elementals rage, machines execute programming.

Clear motivation informs tactics and creates negotiation opportunities. The bandit who needs food might accept payment to leave. The zealot won't.

### Weakness {#enemy-weakness}

Every enemy needs an exploitable vulnerability. Weaknesses fall into three categories:

**Tactical**: Fire stops regeneration, bright light blinds shadow creatures, flanking breaks formation.

**Narrative**: Pride prevents retreat, love for family creates leverage, vows constrain actions.

**Psychological**: Morale breaks when leaders fall, fear of specific symbols or rituals, overconfidence leads to mistakes.

Weaknesses aren't obvious—PCs discover them through observation, research, or experimentation. The first encounter reveals the threat; subsequent preparation lets PCs exploit what they've learned.

### Tactics {#enemy-tactics}

How does this enemy fight or operate? Tactics reflect motivation, capabilities, and intelligence:

**Aggressive**: Charges directly, prioritizes damage over defense, seeks quick resolution.

**Defensive**: Holds position, prioritizes survival, retreats when threatened.

**Cunning**: Uses terrain and preparation, ambushes, exploits PC weaknesses.

**Desperate**: Takes risks, unpredictable actions, escalates when cornered.

Consistent tactics create signature styles. Players learn to recognize threats and prepare accordingly.

### Environmental Synergy {#environmental-synergy}

Enemies should use their environment. The forest ambusher knows every trail and sightline. The urban sniper controls rooftops and angles. The deep-sea predator uses pressure and darkness.

Design encounters around environmental tags that favor the enemy. Make PCs work to neutralize advantages or turn terrain against their foes. A wyvern in a canyon forces PCs into exposed positions—until they use the canyon walls to deny dive attacks.

## Enemy Types {#enemy-types}

### Minions {#enemy-type-minions}

**Purpose**: Create threat through numbers; die quickly but force resource expenditure and tactical attention.

**Design Guidelines**:
- 1-2 skills reflecting their role
- Simple, exploitable weakness
- Morale breaks easily—flee when outnumbered or when leaders fall
- Single-purpose tactics—rush, harass, or defend but don't adapt much

**Example**: Goblin skirmishers with Stealth and Daggers. Tactics: Hit and run, retreat when isolated. Weakness: Break morale by catching one alone. They're dangerous in groups but individually cowardly.

### Elites {#enemy-type-elites}

**Purpose**: Provide meaningful challenge individually; require PCs to use skills and tactics to overcome.

**Design Guidelines**:
- 3-4 skills reflecting specialization
- Exploitable weakness requiring effort to discover or utilize
- Adaptable tactics—respond to PC strategies
- Distinct personality or gimmick

**Example**: Corrupted cultist with Dark Ritual, Persuasion, and Occult Lore. Tactics: Hexes from cover, uses minions as shields. Weakness: Ritual can be disrupted by breaking concentration, vulnerable while casting. Personality: Fervent belief makes them predictable but dangerous.

### Bosses {#enemy-type-bosses}

**Purpose**: Climactic encounters requiring preparation, teamwork, and multiple approaches.

**Design Guidelines**:
- 4-6 skills covering multiple domains
- Conditional weaknesses—require setup or specific circumstances
- Environmental control—use terrain, conditions, and reinforcements
- Multiple phases or tactical shifts during fight

**Example**: Necromancer with Raise Dead, Bone Prison, Soul Bolt, Arcana, Tactics, and Occult Lore. Tactics: Summons minions while maintaining distance, wards against direct assault. Weaknesses: Holy symbols disrupt concentration, exposed during complex rituals, phylactery can be destroyed to prevent recovery. Phases: Summons minions (phase 1), casts powerful hexes when minions fall (phase 2), desperate melee when cornered (phase 3).

### Environmental Threats {#enemy-type-environmental}

**Purpose**: Non-sapient dangers—storms, beasts, hazards—that create pressure without traditional combat.

**Design Guidelines**:
- Tags as primary mechanic (Hazardous, Obscuring, Difficult Terrain)
- Clock-based escalation—threat grows over time
- Minimal skills, mostly environmental effects
- Overcome through preparation or environmental manipulation rather than direct combat

**Example**: Wildfire spreading through forest. Tags: Hazardous (fire), Obscuring (smoke). Clock: "Fire Reaches Camp" (6 segments). Each turn fire advances (tick clock). PCs counter by creating firebreaks, redirecting wind, or escaping. No HP—threat ends when clock fills or PCs remove themselves from danger.

## Enemy Design Templates {#enemy-design-templates}

### Territorial Guardian {#template-territorial-guardian}

**Type**: Minion to Boss depending on scale.

**Motivation**: Defend specific location from intrusion. Not inherently hostile but reacts to trespass.

**Weakness**: Predictable patrol patterns and boundaries. Calms if threat leaves territory. Can be appeased with offerings or demonstrations of respect.

**Tactics**: Challenges intruders first, escalates to violence if ignored. Uses environmental knowledge—hidden paths, traps, terrain advantages. Pursues to territory boundary then returns.

**Skills**: Perception, Intimidation, Territory-specific combat (e.g., Forest Guardian has Archery and Survival; Bridge Troll has Club and Athletics).

**Environmental Preferences**: Chokepoints, elevated positions, familiar ground with prepared defenses.

**GM Usage**: Place guardians as obstacles that reward negotiation or clever avoidance. Make territory boundaries clear so PCs can choose engagement. Use when you want conflict to feel earned rather than inevitable.

**Example**: Ancient stone golem guarding temple entrance. Patrols courtyard, attacks trespassers but doesn't pursue beyond gates. Weakness: Deactivates if proper blessing rites are performed. Tactics: Blocks entry with massive frame, sweeping attacks in confined space.

### Desperate Scavenger {#template-desperate-scavenger}

**Type**: Minion to Elite depending on desperation and capability.

**Motivation**: Needs resources to survive—food, shelter, medicine. Will negotiate if less risky than fighting.

**Weakness**: Flees when injured or outmatched. Loyalty to group is fragile—save themselves over others. Can be bought off or convinced better opportunities exist elsewhere.

**Tactics**: Ambush from desperation, not confidence. Targets perceived weak points—supplies, isolated individuals. Retreats immediately if fight turns against them.

**Skills**: Stealth, Improvised Weapons, Streetwise.

**Environmental Preferences**: Ruins, urban alleys, forests—anywhere with cover for ambush and escape routes.

**GM Usage**: Use when you want morally complex encounters. Scavengers aren't evil, just desperate. Give PCs opportunities to resolve through aid, negotiation, or intimidation. Make consequences of violence feel weighty.

**Example**: Bandit crew blocking road, demanding toll. Leader has family to feed. Tactics: Posture aggressively but retreat if PCs fight seriously. Weakness: Accept food or coin to let PCs pass. Will share information about area if treated with dignity.

### Zealous Believer {#template-zealous-believer}

**Type**: Elite to Boss depending on rank in organization.

**Motivation**: Driven by unshakeable ideology—religious fervor, political conviction, moral certainty. Seeks converts or elimination of opposition.

**Weakness**: Predictable through belief system. Can be reasoned with if core tenets are respected or questioned effectively. Crises of faith create openings. Bound by dogma that constrains actions.

**Tactics**: Fearless aggression backed by conviction. Uses rhetoric and symbolism. Coordinates with fellow believers seamlessly. Fights to death unless faith is shaken.

**Skills**: Persuasion, Ritual or Doctrine, weapon skill reflecting culture.

**Environmental Preferences**: Sacred or ideologically significant spaces. Terrain with symbolic meaning. Places where they can preach or display power.

**GM Usage**: Create encounters where understanding the belief system provides tactical advantage. Let PCs challenge ideology through dialogue, actions, or evidence. Make true believers tragic—dangerous because they're convinced they're righteous.

**Example**: Cult acolyte spreading dark rituals. Tactics: Hexes enemies while preaching conversion. Weakness: Showing evidence their leader is false shakes conviction, disrupts spellcasting. Will protect innocents if doing so aligns with professed values—hypocrisy can be exploited.

### Calculated Hunter {#template-calculated-hunter}

**Type**: Elite to Boss depending on experience and resources.

**Motivation**: Patient pursuit of chosen prey. Treats hunting as craft—studies targets, prepares counters, waits for perfect moment.

**Weakness**: Overconfidence from preparation. If initial plans fail, takes time to regroup rather than adapting immediately. Can be baited into traps using knowledge of their methods.

**Tactics**: Observes before engaging. Exploits discovered weaknesses. Uses terrain and tools methodically. Retreats to prepare better approach if surprised or countered.

**Skills**: Perception, Tactics, Tracking, specialized weapon skill.

**Environmental Preferences**: Any terrain they've prepared. Avoids unfamiliar ground where advantage is lost.

**GM Usage**: Build tension through preparation phase—PCs notice signs of being watched, find evidence of study. First encounter showcases their preparation. Subsequent encounters become battles of preparation and adaptation. Make retreat tactical, not cowardly—they'll return more dangerous.

**Example**: Bounty hunter tracking the party. Studies their tactics from distance, sets ambush using learned patterns. Weakness: Relies on assumed patterns—unpredictable PC behavior forces adaptation. Retreats when ambush fails but leaves warnings they'll try again.

## Scaling Enemies {#scaling-enemies}

### Party Size Adjustments {#scaling-party-size}

Don't just multiply HP. Instead:

**Add Minions**: More PCs mean more minions to spread attention without making any single enemy tankier.

**Adjust Tactics**: Larger parties force enemies to adapt—use area effects, focus fire, or divide attention.

**Environmental Reinforcement**: Add terrain features that favor enemies—cover, elevation, hazards that force PCs to split up.

**Resource Pressure**: More PCs have more resources. Drain them with multiple encounters or conditions that persist.

### Tier Adjustments {#scaling-tier}

As PCs advance, enemies should challenge in new ways:

**Tier 1**: Simple tactics, straightforward weaknesses, direct threats.

**Tier 2**: Coordinated tactics, conditional weaknesses requiring setup, environmental use.

**Tier 3**: Complex strategies, weaknesses requiring research or preparation, backup plans.

**Tier 4**: Multi-phase encounters, weaknesses requiring specific conditions or items, reality-bending capabilities.

Scale by adding layers of complexity, not just bigger numbers. High-tier goblins shouldn't just have more HP—they should use traps, work in coordinated packs, and retreat to prepared positions.

### Difficulty Through Conditions and Tags {#scaling-conditions-tags}

Increase challenge by adding conditions enemies inflict or resist:

**Easy Enemy**: Deals damage.

**Moderate Enemy**: Inflicts Slowed or Weakened conditions on partial success.

**Hard Enemy**: Resists conditions PCs commonly use, inflicts stacking conditions, or creates environmental tags that persist.

This creates tactical depth without arbitrary stat inflation.

## Worked Examples {#enemy-worked-examples}

### Example One: Designing a Minion {#example-minion-design}

**Concept**: Corporate security guard defending office building.

**Type**: Minion.

**Motivation**: Following orders, protecting paycheck. Not personally invested.

**Weakness**: Non-lethal focus—will retreat rather than kill. Protocol-bound—can be confused with forged credentials.

**Tactics**: Challenge intruders, call for backup, use non-lethal weapons. Retreat when outmatched or protocols exceeded.

**Skills**: Observation, Restraint techniques.

**Tags**: Armored (light vest), Protocol-bound.

**GM Usage**: Use as early obstacles that create time pressure (backup coming) without lethal threat. Make them human—they're doing their job, not evil.

### Example Two: Designing an Elite {#example-elite-design}

**Concept**: War troll defending bridge.

**Type**: Elite.

**Motivation**: Territorial—bridge is theirs. Enjoys combat and taking tolls.

**Weakness**: Regeneration stopped by fire or acid. Overconfident—can be baited off footing. Bridge knowledge cuts both ways—predictable positioning.

**Tactics**: Sweeping attacks to push PCs into river, uses reach to control space, regenerates damage unless burned.

**Skills**: Athletics, Club/Bludgeon, Intimidation, River Navigation.

**Tags**: Huge, Regenerating, Moss-covered.

**Conditions Inflicted**: Shaken (fear of massive opponent), Prone (shoved into river).

**GM Usage**: Make the bridge itself part of the fight—narrow footing, slick planks, river below. Let PCs use fire creatively (torches, oil, magic). Troll talks during fight, building personality.
