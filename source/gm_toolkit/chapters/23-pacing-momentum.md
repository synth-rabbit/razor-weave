## Pacing Fundamentals {#pacing-fundamentals}

Pacing is the rhythm of tension and release. Good pacing alternates pressure with relief, giving
players space to breathe between hard choices while maintaining forward momentum. Pacing operates at
multiple scales: scene, session, and arc.

**Tension Curves**: Visualize tension as a curve that rises and falls over time. Scenes with high
tension (combat, critical negotiations, timed challenges) create peaks. Scenes with low tension
(planning, travel, downtime) create valleys. A well-paced session or arc includes both peaks and
valleys, preventing fatigue and monotony.

**Energy Management**: Players have finite attention and decision-making energy. Long sessions with
constant high-stakes tension exhaust players; long sessions with no tension bore them. Manage energy
by varying scene intensity and providing pressure-relief cycles.

**Momentum**: Forward narrative drive that makes players care about what happens next. Momentum
comes from unanswered questions, escalating stakes, and meaningful consequences. Loss of momentum
happens when scenes feel repetitive, stakes are unclear, or player choices do not visibly change the
situation.

Pacing is not about speed. A slow, atmospheric horror session can have excellent pacing if tension
builds steadily. A fast-paced action session can have poor pacing if tension never varies. Pacing is
about rhythm and variety.

## Scene-Level Pacing {#scene-level-pacing}

Scenes have their own internal pacing, shaped by beats, spotlight rotation, and cuts.

**Beats**: Each scene is composed of beats (see Chapter 2: Narrative Structure). Vary beat length
based on table engagement. If players are deeply engaged in a negotiation, let the scene breathe
with multiple dialogue beats. If players are disengaged or the outcome is clear, compress the scene
into fewer beats.

**Spotlight Rotation**: In ensemble scenes (combat, group planning, social events), rotate spotlight
among players to maintain engagement. Avoid long stretches where one player dominates while others
wait. Use initiative order in combat, or rotate clockwise/counterclockwise in social scenes.

**Cuts**: End scenes when stakes resolve or when continuing would repeat beats without changing
state. Cuts maintain momentum by moving to the next lever rather than dwelling on resolved
situations. Example: The negotiation succeeds and the NPC agrees to provide information. Cut to the
next scene where players use that information, rather than playing through the entire conversation's
conclusion.

**Zooming In and Out**: Adjust scene granularity based on importance and engagement. Zoom in (detail
every action, roll every check) for high-stakes moments like climactic combat or critical
negotiations. Zoom out (summarize actions, skip routine checks) for low-stakes moments like shopping
or travel.

GM usage:

- Check table engagement every 15-20 minutes; cut or extend scenes accordingly
- Rotate spotlight every 2-3 minutes in ensemble scenes
- Cut scenes early if stakes are resolved or if players are ready to move on
- Zoom in for climaxes, zoom out for routine moments

## Session-Level Pacing {#session-level-pacing}

Sessions benefit from act structure: beginning, middle, and end with distinct purposes and energy
levels.

**Act One: Setup and Hook** (30-45 minutes)

Begin with a recap of the previous session and immediate hooks. Act One establishes stakes, sets the
session's tone, and gives players their first meaningful choice. This act should answer "What are we
doing?" and "Why does it matter?"

Example: The session begins with the party receiving a contract to investigate disappearances in a
coastal village. Act One includes travel to the village, initial observations, and a first clue (a
witness who saw strange lights near the docks). Players choose whether to investigate the docks
immediately or gather more information in the village.

**Act Two: Development and Complication** (60-90 minutes)

The bulk of the session. Act Two includes multiple scenes with escalating stakes and complications.
This is where most checks happen, resources are spent, and clocks advance. Vary scene intensity to
prevent fatigue: alternate high-tension scenes (combat, chases, critical negotiations) with
medium-tension scenes (investigation, planning, social interactions).

Example: The party investigates the docks (medium tension), discovers smugglers unloading strange
cargo (complication), and chooses to ambush the smugglers (high tension combat). After combat, they
interrogate a captured smuggler (medium tension) and learn the cargo is headed to a warehouse (new
lever).

**Act Three: Climax and Resolution** (30-45 minutes)

The session's high point followed by a resolution beat. Act Three delivers on the session's stakes
and provides a sense of closure, even if larger arc questions remain unanswered. End sessions on a
clear note: a victory, a defeat, a revelation, or a new choice.

Example: The party infiltrates the warehouse and confronts the smuggler leader (climax). They
succeed, capturing the leader and securing the cargo. Resolution: They discover the cargo is cursed
artifacts tied to the larger arc's villain. They return to the village, deliver the captured
smuggler to local authorities, and receive payment. The session ends with the party deciding what to
do with the cursed artifacts.

**Pressure and Relief Cycles**: Within each act, alternate pressure (timed challenges, resource
costs, difficult checks) with relief (successes, safe spaces, moments to regroup). Act Two should
have at least two pressure-relief cycles to prevent exhaustion.

GM usage:

- Plan sessions with three acts; adjust act length based on table energy
- Start sessions with a clear hook and immediate stakes
- Alternate high-tension and medium-tension scenes in Act Two
- End sessions on resolution beats; avoid cliffhangers unless players prefer them
- Include at least two pressure-relief cycles per session

## Arc-Level Pacing {#arc-level-pacing}

Arcs span multiple sessions and require longer pacing rhythms. Arc pacing tracks rising action,
climax placement, and resolution beats across 3-8 sessions.

**Rising Action**: Each session in the arc should escalate stakes or introduce complications. Rising
action creates momentum by making each session matter to the next. Track rising action with arc
clocks: progress clocks (player goals) and pressure clocks (threats or countdowns).

Example: Session 1 introduces the smuggling conspiracy. Session 2 reveals the conspiracy is backed
by a noble house. Session 3 shows the noble house is using cursed artifacts to gain power. Each
session raises the stakes and adds complexity.

**Climax Placement**: Place the arc climax in the final or penultimate session. Climaxes need
buildup; rushing to climax too early makes later sessions feel anticlimactic. Delaying climax too
long risks losing momentum. Aim for climax in Session 5 or 6 of a 6-session arc.

**Resolution Beats**: After the climax, provide resolution: show consequences of player choices,
resolve lingering questions, and transition to the next arc or campaign phase. Resolution can be a
full session (if the arc was long or complex) or part of the climax session (if the arc was short or
the climax resolved most threads).

**Pacing Adjustments**: Not all arcs need uniform pacing. Mystery arcs might have slow buildup
(Sessions 1-4) and rapid climax (Sessions 5-6). Action arcs might have quick setup (Session 1) and
extended climax (Sessions 4-6). Adjust based on genre and table preferences.

GM usage:

- Track rising action with arc clocks; advance clocks every 1-2 sessions
- Place climax in the final or penultimate session of the arc
- Provide resolution beats after climax; do not rush immediately into the next arc
- Adjust pacing based on arc type and table engagement

## Mechanical Pacing Tools {#mechanical-pacing-tools}

Mechanics can shape pacing by creating tension, tracking progress, and introducing time pressure.

**Clocks**: Clocks (see GM Guide Chapter 6) track progress (player goals) and pressure (threats,
countdowns). Advance pressure clocks during downtime or when players delay decisions, creating
urgency. Advance progress clocks when players achieve milestones, providing momentum and
satisfaction.

Example: Run a *Villain's Ritual* pressure clock (6 segments). Advance it once per session or when
players pursue other goals. When the clock fills, the villain completes the ritual and becomes a
greater threat. This creates urgency without scripting outcomes.

**Timers**: Timers are explicit in-fiction countdowns. "You have three days before the ritual
completes" or "The guards return in ten minutes." Timers create immediate pressure and force
decisive action. Use timers sparingly; too many timers creates constant stress with no relief.

**Conditions**: Conditions (see GM Guide Chapter 6) represent character state and create resource
pressure. Accumulating conditions worsens outcomes and forces players to rest or spend resources to
recover. Conditions naturally pace sessions by encouraging rest after intense scenes.

**Montage**: Montage compresses time and skips routine actions (see Chapter 2). Use montage to pace
through low-interest moments ("You spend two days traveling and restocking; give me a Supply check
to see if you are fully prepared") and focus play on meaningful choices.

GM usage:

- Use clocks to track long-term pressure and progress
- Add timers for high-stakes scenes or arc climaxes
- Let conditions accumulate to encourage rest and relief
- Use montage to skip routine moments and maintain momentum

## Troubleshooting Pacing Problems {#troubleshooting-pacing-problems}

Common pacing problems and interventions:

**Stalled Momentum**: Players feel stuck, unsure what to do next, or trapped in analysis paralysis.

Diagnosis: No clear levers, stakes are unclear, or choices feel meaningless.

Intervention: Introduce a new lever (NPC arrives with urgent news, pressure clock advances visibly,
new complication demands response). Restate stakes clearly. Offer a choice with visible consequences
to restore agency.

**Runaway Planning**: Players spend excessive time planning without acting.

Diagnosis: Players fear failure or feel the next scene is too dangerous without perfect preparation.

Intervention: Set a soft timer ("While you plan, guards are approaching; you have a few minutes to
decide"). Offer a montage option ("You finalize the plan over the next hour; describe the key
elements and roll [relevant skill] to see how prepared you are"). Validate the plan and move to
action.

**Uneven Tension**: Sessions feel exhausting (constant tension) or boring (no tension).

Diagnosis: Scenes do not vary in intensity, or pressure-relief cycles are missing.

Intervention: After high-tension scenes, include relief scenes (safe rest, NPC downtime,
celebration). After low-tension stretches, introduce pressure (timer, threat, hard choice). Track
tension visually (notes: "high, low, medium") to ensure variety.

**Anticlimactic Resolutions**: Arc or session climaxes feel flat or rushed.

Diagnosis: Climax lacked buildup, stakes were unclear, or player choices did not matter.

Intervention: Build toward climaxes with rising action across multiple sessions. State stakes
clearly before climax scenes. Ensure player choices determine outcomes, not scripted events.

GM usage:

- Diagnose pacing problems by checking engagement and table energy
- Intervene early when momentum stalls; introduce new levers or restate stakes
- Balance tension with relief; track scene intensity in session notes
- Build toward climaxes with rising action and clear stakes

## Worked Example: Session with Three-Act Structure {#worked-example-session-with-three-act-structure}

**Session Goal**: Investigate a haunted manor and discover the ghost's unfinished business.

**Act One: Setup and Hook** (30 minutes)

Recap: Last session, the party learned of a manor haunted by a restless spirit. Locals refuse to
approach it, but a merchant hires the party to retrieve a family heirloom from inside.

Hook: The party arrives at the manor at dusk. The building is decrepit, windows shattered, vines
overgrown. As they approach, they hear a faint wailing from inside.

Stakes: Retrieve the heirloom and, if possible, help the spirit find peace. Immediate danger: the
manor is structurally unstable and the spirit may be hostile.

First Choice: Players choose an entry point (front door, side window, cellar entrance). Each option
has different risks (front door is obvious but direct; cellar is hidden but trapped; window requires
climbing).

Outcome: Players choose the cellar. They succeed on a Mobility check to navigate the unstable
stairs. Inside, they find signs of old tragedy: burned furniture, scorched walls, a child's toy.
Tension builds. Cut to Act Two.

**Act Two: Development and Complication** (75 minutes)

Scene 1 (Medium Tension): Exploring the manor. Players investigate rooms, finding clues about the
family who lived here: a husband, wife, and young daughter. The husband was an alchemist. Clues
suggest an experiment went wrong, causing a fire. Players roll Awareness to notice arcane symbols on
the walls and residual magic. Partial success: they find the symbols but trigger a magical trap,
creating eerie lights and sounds (atmosphere, minor pressure).

Scene 2 (High Tension): The spirit manifests, a spectral figure of a young girl. She does not attack
but wails and vanishes. The temperature drops. Players must choose: pursue the spirit immediately or
continue investigating. They choose to investigate further.

Scene 3 (Medium Tension): The party finds the husband's study. Inside, a journal describes his
attempt to save his daughter from illness using forbidden alchemy. The ritual failed, killing the
daughter and starting the fire. The heirloom (a locket) is on the desk. Players retrieve it. As they
do, the spirit appears again, this time clearly agitated.

Relief Beat: The party retreats to a stable room to regroup, discuss findings, and plan their next
move. This is a pressure-relief cycle: low tension, no immediate threat, time to strategize.

Scene 4 (High Tension): The party attempts to communicate with the spirit using the journal and
locket. They offer to bury the locket with her remains (if they can find them) or complete a ritual
to lay her to rest. Players roll Influence or relevant skills. Partial success: the spirit calms but
reveals her remains are in the cellar, where the fire started. The cellar is unstable and dangerous.

Complication: As they descend to the cellar, part of the floor collapses. Players must navigate
hazards (Mobility or teamwork checks). Success gets them to the remains without injury. Failure or
partial results in conditions (Injured, Exhausted).

Cut to Act Three.

**Act Three: Climax and Resolution** (30 minutes)

Climax: The party finds the daughter's remains in the cellar, badly burned. They use the locket and
perform a simple ritual (either based on the journal or improvised). Call for a final check (Lore,
Influence, or relevant skill) to determine success.

Outcome: Success means the spirit appears, thanks the party, and peacefully dissipates. The haunting
ends. Partial success means the spirit dissipates but the manor remains unsettled (future
complications). Failure means the spirit becomes hostile (brief combat or frantic escape).

Resolution: The party exits the manor, heirloom in hand. They return to the merchant, deliver the
locket, and receive payment. The merchant asks what they learned about the haunting. Players can
share the truth (earning the merchant's gratitude and potential future work) or conceal details
(keeping secrets but losing trust).

Final Beat: The session ends with the party resting at an inn. One player reflects on the tragedy,
creating a character moment. The GM hints at the next session's hook (a letter arrives requesting
the party's help with another problem).

**Pacing Breakdown**:

- Act One established stakes and tone, providing a clear hook and first choice.
- Act Two alternated tension: medium (investigation), high (spirit encounter), medium (study
  discovery), relief (planning), high (cellar hazards). Two pressure-relief cycles prevented
  fatigue.
- Act Three delivered a satisfying climax with player choice determining outcomes, followed by
  resolution and transition to the next session.
- Total session time: 135 minutes (2.25 hours), with clear act breaks for table energy management.
