## Expansion Plan {#expansion-plan}

- Define a single, repeatable sequence that covers exploration, social, combat,
  and downtime.
- Provide tiered outcomes (Full/Partial/Fail) with DC ladder cues and visible
  state updates (tags, conditions, clocks).
- Include four micro examples (one per mode) showing the loop in action.

## What the Loop Is {#what-the-loop-is}

The gameplay loop is the conversation engine of your table: players declare
intent, you judge risk, dice resolve uncertainty, and the world changes in ways
everyone can feel. The loop is fast, visible, and fair—never stalling on
binary gates. Progress and pressure move through clocks, tags, and conditions
so that success or cost always pushes the fiction forward.

GM Usage: Keep the loop explicit. Name what success looks like, what a Partial
costs, and how a Failure escalates pressure.

## The Core Cycle {#the-core-cycle}

Ask → Declare → Judge → Resolve → Update → Ask

1) Ask: “What do you do?” Focus on the present situation and objective.
2) Declare: Players state clear intent and approach; you clarify details.
3) Judge: Choose tool (skill/proficiency), pick a DC from the ladder (12 easy ·
   14 routine · 16 tough · 18 hard · 20 heroic · 22 legendary), apply
   advantage/disadvantage from fiction.
4) Resolve: Roll and interpret tiered outcomes (Full/Partial/Fail/Crit).
5) Update: Tick progress/pressure clocks; add/remove tags; impose/clear
   conditions; reveal new information.
6) Ask again: Offer a meaningful follow‑up choice to continue momentum.

Alignment note: This loop maps directly onto the
[Scene procedure](./05-scene-structure.md#frame-stakes-check)
(Frame → Stakes → Check → Narrate → React). Use the loop to pace conversation
and the scene steps to structure decisions and outcomes.

## Loop at the Table (Tip) {#loop-tip}

- Keep it short: resolve a concrete objective or escalate pressure, then ask.
- Name levers: say which tags/conditions/clocks are in play right now.
- Pre‑state beats: say Full/Partial/Fail before dice; prefer motion over stalls.
- Offer choices: every update should open at least two meaningful next actions.

## Information Flow & Stakes {#information-flow--stakes}

- Pre‑state beats: say what Full/Partial/Fail mean before rolling.
- Tick complication clocks on Partial only when you’ve pre‑stated them.
- Make costs move the story: time, noise, position, resources, attention. Avoid dead ends.
- Keep state visible: display clocks; call out tags/conditions when they change.
- Tie fiction to numbers: DCs reflect situational leverage, not hidden math.

## Loop Variants by Mode {#loop-variants-by-mode}

Exploration: Emphasize mapping, concealment, time, and environmental tags.
Progress and pressure clocks pace travel, stealth, and hazards.

Social: Emphasize leverage, credibility, and audience mood. Costs create
obligations, scrutiny, and changed access rather than hard denials.

Combat: Emphasize order/spotlight and space control. Partial results often fill
pressure clocks (reinforcements, structural collapse) or degrade cover/tags.

Downtime: Emphasize projects and recovery. Each loop pass advances a project
clock; costs introduce complications, rivals, or time slips.

## Table Cadence & Spotlight {#table-cadence--spotlight}

- Rotate cleanly: after each resolve/update, point to someone with an immediate hook.
- Group when helpful: treat a team action as one loop pass with help/aid resolving internally.
- Use popcorn ordering in tense scenes to keep urgency; anchor key beats (e.g., defenses) if needed.
- Keep loops short: resolve a concrete objective or escalate pressure, then ask again.

## Worked Micro Examples {#worked-micro-examples}

Reminder: Only tick complication clocks on Partial when you have pre‑stated
them for the scene or beat.

### Exploration — “Lantern Bridge” {#ex-lantern-bridge}

Setup: A rickety bridge spans a misty ravine at night. Objective: cross
quietly before patrols circle back.

Tags: Dim, Slick, Swaying Planks. Clocks: Progress — Crossed (4); Pressure — Patrol Returns (6).

Checks: Balance/Acrobatics (DC 16, Tough) to move safely; Stealth (DC 14,
Routine) to muffle clatter. Dim can grant Advantage to Stealth if moving
slowly.

Outcomes:

- Full: Tick Crossed 2. “You pace your steps; the boards barely whisper.”
- Partial: Tick Crossed 1 and Patrol 1; add Tag: Loose Board. “One plank
   flexes and groans—time is slipping.”
- Fail: No progress; Patrol +2; impose Condition: Shaken or Tag: Loud
   Footfalls. “A plank snaps; echoes carry into the fog.”

Follow‑up: Ask whether to press quickly (drop Advantage) or slow down (risk Patrol).

### Social — “Closed Kitchen” {#ex-closed-kitchen}

Setup: The head chef has closed the kitchen; the party needs access to prep an antidote.

Tags: Overworked Staff, Hot Line (Distracting). Clock: Pressure — Management Scrutiny (6).

Checks: Negotiation (DC 16, Tough) to secure an exception; Performance (DC 14,
Routine) to rally staff; Streetwise (DC 14, Routine) to find a sympathetic
sous‑chef.

Outcomes:

- Full: Access granted; note an ally in the brigade.
- Partial: Access with strings (tight window or a favor); tick Scrutiny 1.
- Fail: Denied for now; Scrutiny +2; add Tag: Flagged Request.

Follow‑up: Offer a tradeoff—accept a shorter window (reduced margin) or do a
quick task to clear Flagged Request.

### Combat — “Warehouse Standoff” {#ex-warehouse-standoff}

Setup: Smugglers take cover among crates; the party wants to seize the ledger.

Tags: Solid Cover (Crates), Dim, Narrow Aisles. Clocks: Progress — Secure
Ledger (4); Pressure — Reinforcements (6).

Typical Beats: Set Up (create angle), Strike (contest vs cover), Maneuver
(flank or shove), Defend/Withdraw to reset.

Checks: Set Up (DC 14, Routine) to climb a gantry for angle; Strike contests vs
defender; Maneuver (DC 16, Tough) to shove an enemy from cover.

Outcomes (example Strike):

- Full: Tick Ledger 2; degrade enemy cover (Fragile → Spent).
- Partial: Tick Ledger 1; Reinforcements +1; add Tag: Exposed Position.
- Fail: No progress; Reinforcements +2; Condition: Suppressed.

Follow‑up: Offer choices—clear Suppressed by withdrawing (time cost) or gamble
on a Set Up to flip Exposed.

### Downtime — “Decode the Ledger” {#ex-downtime-ledger}

Setup: After the standoff, the party decodes ciphered entries to expose the ring.

Project Clock: Expose Operation (6). Complication Clock: Heat (6).

Checks: Research/Cryptography (DC 16, Tough) for progress; Contacts/Streetwise
(DC 14, Routine) to source context and reduce DCs by creating advantage.

Outcomes per pass:

- Full: Tick Expose 2; note a lead.
- Partial: Tick Expose 1 and Heat 1.
- Fail: Heat +2; add Tag: Tipped Hand (future social checks start at DC +2 until cleared).

Follow‑up: Choose to pursue a side scene to clear Tipped Hand or press on and
accept future friction.
