## Narrative Layers {#narrative-layers}

Narrative structure in tabletop roleplaying works in nested layers, each with its own scope and
pacing. Understanding these layers helps you zoom in to individual moments or zoom out to see the
larger arc.

**Scene**: A single continuous unit of play in one location with one set of stakes. Scenes last
15-45 minutes and end when the immediate stakes resolve or the situation changes significantly.

**Sequence**: A group of 2-5 connected scenes with rising or falling tension. Sequences create
narrative momentum by linking scenes thematically or causally. A sequence might span one session or
bridge two sessions.

**Arc**: A complete story with setup, development, climax, and resolution, typically spanning 3-8
sessions. Arcs have central themes, escalating stakes, and clear endpoints. Think of an arc as a
season of television or a complete adventure module.

**Campaign**: Multiple arcs connected by setting, characters, and overarching themes. Campaigns can
be episodic (standalone arcs with continuity), serial (tightly connected arcs building to a finale),
or hybrid (mix of both).

This nested structure lets you compress or expand based on table interest. If players are deeply
engaged in a social conflict, expand the sequence from two scenes to four. If they want to skip
travel montage, compress three potential scenes into one narrated transition.

## Beats Within Scenes {#beats-within-scenes}

Each scene is built from beats: discrete moments that change the situation or escalate pressure. A
well-structured scene includes these beats:

**Frame**: Establish where characters are, what they are doing, and what immediate problem or
opportunity they face. Framing anchors players in the fiction and sets up the stakes.

**Stakes**: State clearly what is at risk or what can be gained in this scene. Stakes can be
immediate (escape the guards) or connected to larger arc themes (preserve your reputation).

**Action**: Players declare actions and you call for checks when outcomes are uncertain and stakes
are meaningful. Use the core resolution mechanics (see GM Guide Chapter 4) to determine success,
partial success, or failure.

**Consequence**: Narrate outcomes based on check results. Successes advance player goals, partials
succeed with cost or complication, failures introduce new problems or escalate pressure.

**Transition**: Close the scene when stakes resolve or when continuing forward would repeat beats
without changing state. Transition to the next scene by stating what changed and what new lever
players can pull.

Not every scene needs all five beats explicitly. Social scenes might loop through
Stakes-Action-Consequence several times. Exploration scenes might compress Frame and Stakes into a
single opening beat. Use these beats as a checklist, not a rigid script.

## Scene Sequences {#scene-sequences}

Scenes gain power when connected into sequences with rising or falling tension. A sequence creates
narrative momentum by making each scene matter to the next.

**Rising Tension**: Each scene in the sequence escalates stakes, introduces new complications, or
reduces player resources. Use rising tension for investigative sequences (each clue leads to a more
dangerous location) or action sequences (chase escalates to rooftop confrontation to hostage
standoff).

**Falling Tension**: Each scene in the sequence offers relief, resolution, or recovery after a
climax. Use falling tension for aftermath sequences (dealing with consequences of a heist) or
downtime sequences (celebrating victory, then discovering what was left unresolved).

Structure a sequence with clear connective tissue. The end of one scene should create a new lever or
question that pulls players into the next scene. If Scene 1 reveals a suspect's location, Scene 2 is
the confrontation at that location. If Scene 2 ends with the suspect escaping through a hidden
tunnel, Scene 3 is navigating the tunnels or discovering where they lead.

A strong sequence needs 2-5 scenes. Two scenes create a simple cause-and-effect. Three scenes allow
setup, complication, and resolution. Four or five scenes risk losing momentum unless each scene
changes state significantly.

## Story Arcs {#story-arcs}

An arc is a complete story with clear beginning, middle, and end. Arcs provide structure for 3-8
sessions and give players a sense of progress and resolution.

**Setup** (1-2 sessions): Introduce the central problem, establish stakes, and give players their
first levers. Setup scenes frame the arc's theme and let players form a plan or choose a direction.

**Development** (2-4 sessions): Escalate complications, reveal new information, and test player
plans. Development is where most play happens: investigation, negotiation, exploration, and tactical
problem-solving. Track progress with clocks and adjust pacing based on table engagement.

**Climax** (1 session): Bring the arc to a high-stakes resolution point. Climax scenes pull together
threads from setup and development, giving players a chance to use what they have learned and built.
Climaxes are not always combat; they can be social confrontations, heists, or critical decisions.

**Resolution** (1 session or part of the climax session): Show the consequences of player choices
and close open loops. Resolution provides emotional payoff and transitions to the next arc or
campaign phase.

Not every arc needs equal weight in each phase. Mystery arcs might spend more time in development
(investigation) than setup. Action arcs might compress setup into a single scene and focus on a
multi-scene climax.

## Campaign Structure {#campaign-structure}

Campaigns organize multiple arcs into larger patterns. Choose a campaign structure based on your
group's preferences and the kind of stories you want to tell.

**Episodic**: Each arc stands alone with minimal continuity between arcs. Players might face
different challenges each arc, with recurring characters or setting but no overarching plot.
Episodic campaigns are flexible and forgiving; missing a session or adding new players is easy.

**Serial**: Arcs build toward a long-term goal or confrontation. Each arc advances an overarching
plot or reveals part of a larger mystery. Serial campaigns create strong narrative momentum but
require consistent attendance and careful continuity tracking.

**Hybrid**: Some arcs are standalone; others connect to an overarching plot. Hybrid campaigns
balance flexibility with long-term payoff. Use standalone arcs to explore new themes or locations,
and serial arcs to advance the central storyline.

Choose your campaign structure at Session Zero (see Chapter 8) and communicate it clearly to
players. If you start episodic and discover players want long-term plot, you can pivot by
introducing recurring NPCs or faction clocks that bridge arcs.

## Compression and Expansion {#compression-and-expansion}

Adjust narrative scope dynamically based on table interest and pacing needs. Compression and
expansion techniques let you speed through routine moments or dwell on meaningful choices.

**Montage**: Summarize a series of actions or scenes with a single narration or check. Use montage
for travel, downtime projects, or repetitive tasks. Example: "You spend three days gathering
supplies and repairing the ship. Give me a Supply check to see if you are fully stocked or need to
improvise." Montages keep momentum without skipping narrative consequences.

**Flashback**: Introduce a scene from the past to answer a present question or provide context.
Flashbacks can be player-initiated ("I want to flashback to when I studied that sigil in the
library") or GM-framed ("You recognize this trap; you have seen it before. Let's flashback to that
moment"). Use flashbacks sparingly to avoid disrupting present tension.

**Time Jumps**: Skip forward days, weeks, or months between arcs or during resolution. Time jumps
let campaigns breathe and reset stakes without playing through every day. Example: "Three months
pass. Your wounds heal, the city rebuilds, and rumors spread about your role in stopping the cult.
We pick up as you are summoned to the palace."

When players are deeply engaged, expand. Add extra scenes, zoom in on character moments, or let a
single scene breathe with multiple beats. When momentum lags, compress. Cut to the next lever,
montage the journey, or transition quickly to the next stakes.

## Worked Example: Three-Scene Sequence {#worked-example-three-scene-sequence}

**Sequence Goal**: Investigate a warehouse used by a smuggling ring, rising tension from stealthy
reconnaissance to direct confrontation.

**Scene 1: Waterfront Surveillance** (Rising Tension: Setup)

Frame: The party watches the warehouse from a dockside tavern at dusk. Dock workers finish their
shifts; a few cloaked figures slip inside the warehouse after dark.

Stakes: Identify patterns, routines, or vulnerabilities without alerting the smugglers.

Action: Players declare surveillance approaches (watching from the tavern, scouting the perimeter,
bribing a dock worker). Call for Awareness or Influence checks.

Consequence: Success reveals guard rotations and a sewer entrance. Partial reveals the entrance but
also that the guards are alert and suspicious. Failure means guards notice surveillance and increase
patrols.

Transition: Players have enough information to plan entry. They move to Scene 2.

**Scene 2: Sewer Infiltration** (Rising Tension: Complication)

Frame: The party enters through the sewer grate. The tunnel is narrow, damp, and dark. They hear
voices and footsteps from above.

Stakes: Reach the warehouse interior without raising an alarm or getting trapped in the tunnels.

Action: Players navigate the sewer (Mobility checks), listen for guard positions (Awareness), and
find the interior access point.

Consequence: Success gets them inside undetected with a positional advantage. Partial gets them
inside but a guard hears noise and investigates. Failure triggers an alarm or reveals that the sewer
entrance is trapped.

Transition: Players are now inside the warehouse but in a precarious position. They move to Scene 3.

**Scene 3: Warehouse Confrontation** (Rising Tension: Climax)

Frame: Inside, the warehouse is stacked with crates. A group of smugglers counts coin at a central
table. The party has surprise if they succeeded in Scene 2, or the smugglers are alert if Scene 2
was a partial or failure.

Stakes: Capture or interrogate the smuggler leader to learn who is funding the operation, or defeat
the smugglers and secure evidence.

Action: Players choose their approach (ambush, negotiation, stealth extraction). Use combat
mechanics (GM Guide Chapter 11) or social conflict (Chapter 11 of this guide).

Consequence: Success captures the leader and evidence. Partial achieves one goal but the other
escapes or is destroyed. Failure means the smugglers flee, destroy evidence, or reinforcements
arrive.

Transition: Scene resolves with players gaining new information or complications. Transition to the
next sequence or arc based on what they learned and what new levers emerged.

This three-scene sequence demonstrates rising tension: each scene escalates stakes and narrows
player options. The consequence of Scene 1 sets up Scene 2; the consequence of Scene 2 shapes the
stakes of Scene 3. If players were deeply engaged, you could expand Scene 2 into two scenes
(navigating tunnels, then bypassing a trapped door). If they wanted faster pacing, compress Scenes 1
and 2 into a single reconnaissance montage and start at Scene 3.
