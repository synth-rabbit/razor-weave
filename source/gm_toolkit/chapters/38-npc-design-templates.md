# NPC Design and Templates {#gm-npc-design-templates}

Non-Player Characters are the supporting cast that brings your world to life. They provide hooks, advance plots through secrets and agendas, create meaningful relationships with PCs, and serve as windows into your setting's culture and conflicts. This chapter provides role-based frameworks for creating NPCs quickly and effectively, from five-minute throwaways to complex recurring characters.

## NPC Design Philosophy {#npc-design-philosophy}

Great NPCs don't need complex stat blocks. They need purpose, personality, and a reason to matter. When designing an NPC, focus on four core elements:

**Purpose**: What role does this NPC serve in your story? Are they a quest-giver, information source, obstacle, ally, or complication? Purpose determines how much detail you need and which template to use.

**Personality**: Give each important NPC 2-3 distinctive traits that shape how they interact with PCs. A greedy merchant haggles differently than a generous one. A cautious guard asks different questions than a bold one. Personality creates consistency and memorability.

**Goals**: Every NPC wants something, even if it's just to finish their shift without trouble. Goals create hooks for PC interaction and give you clear leverage points for negotiation, conflict, or alliance.

**Secrets**: What does this NPC know, hide, or want that isn't immediately visible? Secrets create depth and provide narrative payoffs when revealed. Even minor NPCs can carry useful secrets—the baker knows who meets behind the mill, the guard is in debt, the scholar reads banned texts.

These four elements give you everything needed to run an NPC consistently at the table. Skills and mechanical details matter less than knowing what drives the character and how they'll react to PC actions.

## When to Create NPCs {#when-to-create-npcs}

Not every character needs full development. Use this guidance to match detail level to narrative importance:

**Full NPC Templates** (20-minute creation): Use for recurring characters who will appear multiple times, have significant impact on the plot, or develop ongoing relationships with PCs. Examples include faction leaders, quest-givers, mentors, major rivals, and recurring antagonists. These NPCs deserve goals, secrets, personality traits, skills, and relationship dynamics.

**Quick NPCs** (5-10 minutes): Use for characters who appear in 1-3 scenes but serve a specific narrative function. Examples include merchants with critical information, guards blocking a gate, witnesses to crimes, hireling specialists, or one-time allies. These NPCs need a clear role, one distinctive trait, and a simple goal or secret.

**Generic Templates** (instant): Use for background characters who exist to populate scenes but don't drive plot. Examples include tavern crowds, market vendors, random guards, servants, or bystanders. Give them a profession and one sentence of description. If PCs engage deeply with a generic NPC, promote them to quick NPC status on the fly by adding a goal and secret.

**Important vs Memorable**: An NPC's importance to the plot doesn't always match their memorability. A one-scene informant with a vivid personality can be more memorable than a recurring quest-giver with bland presentation. Invest personality into NPCs you want players to remember, regardless of their plot significance.

## Role-Based Templates {#role-based-templates}

NPCs naturally fall into five core roles based on how they relate to PCs. Each role has distinct functions, typical goals, and relationship dynamics. Understanding these roles helps you create NPCs that serve clear narrative purposes.

### Ally {#role-ally}

**Function**: Allies support PCs with resources, information, connections, or direct assistance. They share goals with the party or have complementary interests that align for mutual benefit.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Helpful but not subservient**: Allies have their own priorities and limits. They help because it serves their interests or values, not because PCs demand it.
- **Provide resources or access**: Allies offer what PCs can't easily obtain themselves—safe houses, political connections, specialized knowledge, equipment, healing, or introductions.
- **Create investment**: The best allies give PCs something to protect or lose. When allies face danger, PCs care about the outcome.

**Template Structure**:
- **Personality Traits** (2-3): Choose traits that explain why they help and how they interact. Examples: loyal, pragmatic, idealistic, protective, generous, cautious.
- **Goal**: What do they want that makes them willing to help PCs? Examples: protect their community, advance a cause, gain allies against a threat, fulfill an oath.
- **Secret**: What do they hide that could complicate the alliance? Examples: divided loyalties, past failures, hidden vulnerabilities, compromising debts.
- **Skills** (2-3): Capabilities they can offer PCs. Examples: Hospitality, Medicine, Persuasion, Streetwise, Crafting, Research.
- **Notable Trait**: One distinctive feature that makes them memorable. Examples: speaks in metaphors, always carries tea, has burn scars from saving others.

**Evolving Ally Relationships**:
- Start with limited trust and gradually increase investment as PCs prove reliable
- Give allies challenges PCs can help solve, creating reciprocal support
- Threaten allies to raise stakes or force PCs to make hard choices
- Allow allies to disagree with PC methods while maintaining shared goals
- Consider promoting long-term allies to PC-like complexity with character arcs

**Examples Across Genres**:
- **Cozy**: Village baker who feeds travelers and shares gossip; goal is community harmony, secret is knows who sneaks around at night
- **Fantasy**: Grizzled mercenary who respects competence; goal is one last score before retirement, secret is protecting a war orphan
- **Horror**: Trauma support group leader who helps survivors; goal is prevent more victims, secret is witnessed the entity firsthand
- **Modern**: Street medic who treats anyone without questions; goal is save lives, secret is avoiding medical board suspension
- **Sci-Fi**: Ship's engineer who keeps systems running; goal is protect the crew, secret is patched a critical flaw that could fail catastrophically

### Rival {#role-rival}

**Function**: Rivals compete with PCs for goals, resources, or recognition but aren't outright enemies. They create tension and stakes through opposition without necessarily being antagonistic.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Competing interests**: Rivals want the same things PCs want—treasure, reputation, contracts, promotions, romantic interests, or victories.
- **Not hostile**: Rivalry involves competition, not destruction. Rivals might obstruct PCs but generally play fair or at least stay within understood boundaries.
- **Respect and friction**: The best rivals acknowledge PC competence while still trying to outperform them. There's often grudging respect beneath the competition.

**Template Structure**:
- **Personality Traits** (2-3): Competitive, skilled, prideful, ambitious, honorable, petty.
- **Competing Goal**: What specific thing are they trying to achieve that conflicts with PC goals? Be concrete—"win the tournament," "secure the contract," "impress the sponsor."
- **Hidden Respect or Envy**: What do they secretly admire or resent about the PCs? This creates complexity and potential for relationship evolution.
- **Skills** (2-3): Capabilities that make them credible competition. Often overlaps with PC skills.
- **Notable Trait**: Something that differentiates their approach or makes encounters distinctive.

**Making Rivals Interesting Without Hostility**:
- Frame rivalry as "we both want to win" rather than "I want you to lose"
- Give rivals their own allies and resources, making competition feel fair
- Allow rivals to occasionally help PCs when larger threats emerge
- Create scenarios where PCs and rivals must cooperate temporarily
- Reward players for creative competition rather than just defeating the rival

**Evolving Rival Relationships**:
- Escalate rivalry through a series of competitions or confrontations
- Introduce complications that force cooperation or reveal shared enemies
- Allow rivalry to transform into alliance, grudging friendship, or genuine enmity based on PC actions
- Use rivals to create urgency—if PCs delay, the rival might succeed first

**Examples Across Genres**:
- **Cozy**: Rival shopkeeper competing for best seasonal display; respects quality but hates losing, secretly admires PC creativity
- **Fantasy**: Scheming noble competing for royal favor; politically savvy and ambitious, envies PC direct approach to problems
- **Horror**: Skeptical detective investigating the same case; values evidence over intuition, slowly convinced by PC discoveries
- **Modern**: Investigative journalist chasing the same story; wants the scoop, can be convinced to collaborate for bigger impact
- **Sci-Fi**: Smuggler captain competing for trade routes; respects competence, rivalry could turn to partnership

### Mentor {#role-mentor}

**Function**: Mentors teach, guide, or sponsor PCs, offering wisdom, training, or protection. They represent what PCs might become and often serve as moral or skill-based role models.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Knowledge to share**: Mentors possess skills, experience, or wisdom PCs lack and need.
- **Investment in PC growth**: Mentors care about PC development, whether from duty, affection, or seeing potential.
- **Limitations or flaws**: To avoid overshadowing PCs, mentors must have clear boundaries—they can't solve every problem themselves.

**Template Structure**:
- **Personality Traits** (2-3): Patient, wise, demanding, protective, eccentric, world-weary.
- **Wisdom to Share**: What specific knowledge, skill, or perspective can they teach? Be concrete about what they offer.
- **Limitation or Flaw**: What prevents them from solving problems directly? Examples: physical frailty, political constraints, past failures, limited time, ethical boundaries.
- **Skills** (2-3): Areas of expertise they can teach or demonstrate. These should be high competency in fields PCs need.
- **Notable Trait**: Something that makes their mentorship distinctive—teaching style, philosophy, or memorable quirk.

**Avoiding Overshadowing PCs**:
- Make mentors advisors, not protagonists. They guide but don't act unless PCs are truly stuck.
- Give mentors responsibilities that keep them from accompanying PCs on every adventure.
- Create situations where mentor knowledge must be applied by PCs in the field.
- Allow PCs to surpass their mentor in specific areas, showing growth.
- Endanger mentors to raise stakes or force PCs to act independently.

**Evolving Mentor Relationships**:
- Begin with formal teaching and gradually shift to peer collaboration
- Create tests or challenges mentors set for PCs to prove growth
- Reveal mentor flaws or past mistakes that complicate the relationship
- Allow PCs to eventually protect or rescue their mentors, reversing the dynamic
- Consider mentors retiring, moving on, or being removed to force PC independence

**Examples Across Genres**:
- **Cozy**: Retired artisan teaching traditional crafts; patient and skilled, limitation is aging body can't do the work anymore
- **Fantasy**: Court wizard offering magical guidance; powerful but cryptic, limitation is fears knowledge will die with them
- **Horror**: Occult scholar who knows forbidden lore; warns of dangers, limitation is sanity fraying from exposure
- **Modern**: Veteran investigator teaching tradecraft; experienced and tactical, limitation is past mistakes haunt them
- **Sci-Fi**: Ship's engineer teaching system maintenance; gruff but caring, limitation is bound to the ship and can't leave

### Antagonist {#role-antagonist}

**Function**: Antagonists oppose PCs with clear goals and methods, creating conflict through competing interests, ideology, or direct obstruction. Unlike enemies, antagonists are characters with complex motivations, not just obstacles.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Clear opposing goals**: Antagonists want specific things that conflict with PC objectives. The conflict should be understandable even if not sympathetic.
- **Methods and resources**: Antagonists have plans, allies, and means to pursue their goals. They act, not just react.
- **Vulnerability or weakness**: What makes the antagonist defeatable? Every antagonist needs exploitable weaknesses—pride, loyalties, limited resources, legal constraints.

**Template Structure**:
- **Personality Traits** (2-3): Ruthless, idealistic, charismatic, paranoid, calculating, passionate.
- **Goal Conflicting with PCs**: Be specific about what they want and why it opposes the party.
- **Vulnerability**: What emotional, tactical, or structural weakness can PCs exploit? Examples: family loyalty, public image concerns, overconfidence, limited funds.
- **Skills** (2-3): Capabilities that make them formidable opposition. Often includes social manipulation, tactical planning, or specialized expertise.
- **Notable Trait**: Something that makes them distinctive and memorable as opposition.

**Making Antagonists Sympathetic or Complex**:
- Give them understandable motivations even if methods are wrong
- Show them caring about something or someone beyond their goals
- Create situations where PCs and antagonists could cooperate against greater threats
- Allow antagonists to respect or admire PC capabilities
- Provide opportunities for redemption, alliance, or compromise if PCs pursue them

**Evolving Antagonist Relationships**:
- Escalate conflict through a series of confrontations with rising stakes
- Reveal layers of motivation that complicate initial impressions
- Allow PCs to discover antagonist vulnerabilities through investigation
- Create pressure points PCs can use to negotiate or manipulate
- Consider whether antagonists can be defeated, converted, or bargained with

**Examples Across Genres**:
- **Cozy**: Mysterious stranger disrupting town peace; unclear motives, vulnerable to community pressure and isolation
- **Fantasy**: Scheming noble seeking political power; ambitious and connected, vulnerable through family reputation
- **Horror**: Cult recruiter offering answers; charismatic and persuasive, vulnerable when exposed or separated from followers
- **Modern**: Corporate executive prioritizing profit over safety; ruthless but professional, vulnerable to legal exposure or scandal
- **Sci-Fi**: Corporate agent enforcing company interests; efficient and well-resourced, vulnerable to being reasoned with if logic favors compromise

### Informant {#role-informant}

**Function**: Informants provide information, often transactionally or reluctantly. They know things PCs need and can be convinced, coerced, or paid to share that knowledge.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Valuable knowledge**: Informants possess specific information PCs need—locations, secrets, identities, plans, or context.
- **Transactional relationships**: Information has a price, whether money, favors, protection, or something else the informant values.
- **Reliability concerns**: Informants may have incomplete knowledge, hidden agendas, or reasons to mislead. Trust is always a question.

**Template Structure**:
- **Personality Traits** (2-3): Cautious, greedy, nervous, connected, discrete, opportunistic.
- **What They Know**: Be specific about the information they possess and its value.
- **What They Want**: The price for their information. Examples: payment, protection from threats, favors owed, reputation management, immunity from consequences.
- **Skills** (2-3): Often includes Streetwise, Gossip, Research, Perception, or specialized knowledge.
- **Notable Trait**: Something that makes interactions distinctive—mannerisms, meeting preferences, verification methods.

**Managing Information Flow Through Informants**:
- Portion information across multiple informants to avoid single info-dumps
- Give informants partial or flawed knowledge that requires verification
- Create urgency by making informants time-limited or threatened
- Allow PCs to build long-term informant relationships through repeated fair dealing
- Use informants to introduce new plot threads or complications

**Evolving Informant Relationships**:
- Start with expensive, limited information and gradually build trust
- Create situations where informants need PC help, reversing the dynamic
- Threaten informants to raise stakes or force PCs to provide protection
- Allow reliable informants to become allies if PCs invest in the relationship
- Introduce competing informants with conflicting information

**Examples Across Genres**:
- **Cozy**: Nosy neighbor who knows local secrets; wants to feel important, knows who sneaks around at night
- **Fantasy**: Wandering bard collecting rumors; wants good stories to tell, knows political gossip and local legends
- **Horror**: Haunted witness with traumatized memory; wants to forget, knows crucial details about the entity
- **Modern**: Hacker contact with digital access; paranoid and cautious, wants payment or favors
- **Sci-Fi**: Alien diplomat with cultural knowledge; wants peaceful contact, knows protocols and hidden tensions

## Quick NPC Creation Procedures {#quick-npc-creation}

When you need an NPC immediately, use these time-boxed procedures to create characters with appropriate detail levels.

### 5-Minute NPC {#five-minute-npc}

**Use For**: Background characters who might matter but don't yet. Vendors, guards, witnesses, service providers.

**Procedure**:
1. **Name**: Pick or generate a name appropriate to setting
2. **Role**: Choose from the five core roles (Ally, Rival, Mentor, Antagonist, Informant)
3. **One Trait**: Pick a single distinctive personality trait that guides interaction
4. **One Goal**: State what they want in this moment or generally

**Example**: Guard Captain Rusk (Informant). Overworked and practical. Wants help covering a staffing shortfall.

**At the Table**: You know enough to roleplay consistent responses and improvise details. If the NPC becomes important, promote them to 10-minute detail level.

### 10-Minute NPC {#ten-minute-npc}

**Use For**: NPCs who will appear in multiple scenes or have specific plot importance. Quest-givers, recurring contacts, minor faction representatives.

**Procedure**:
1. **Name and Role**: As above
2. **Personality** (2-3 traits): Choose traits that create internal consistency
3. **Goal**: What do they want, and why does it matter?
4. **Secret**: One hidden fact, motivation, or complication
5. **Skills** (2-3): From Mechanics Guide, representing what they can offer or threaten

**Example**: Sister Morwen (Ally). Devout, practical, unnervingly calm. Wants to protect her community from occult threats. Secret: touched a cursed artifact and still hears it whispering. Skills: Ritual Knowledge, Composure, Occult Lore.

**At the Table**: You have enough to run multiple encounters, create hooks from their goal and secret, and know what they're competent at mechanically.

### 20-Minute NPC {#twenty-minute-npc}

**Use For**: Major recurring NPCs with significant plot impact. Faction leaders, primary quest-givers, important antagonists, long-term allies.

**Procedure**:
1. Complete the full role template for their category
2. Add **Relationships**: How do they connect to 1-2 other NPCs, factions, or PCs?
3. Add **Arc Potential**: How might this NPC change based on PC actions? What evolution feels natural?
4. Add **Visual/Behavioral Details**: Distinctive appearance, mannerisms, speech patterns, signature items

**Example**: Archivist Lysa (Informant/Ally). Curious, absent-minded, protective of knowledge. Goal: ensure dangerous knowledge is preserved but controlled. Secret: maintains a hidden ledger of banned titles and who reads them. Skills: Research, History, Appraisal. Relationships: answers to Head Librarian (antagonist to free information), secretly helps young scholar (potential ally). Arc Potential: could become full ally if PCs prove trustworthy with secrets, or antagonist if PCs abuse knowledge access. Details: ink-stained fingers, constantly adjusting spectacles, tucks hair behind ear when lying, office smells of old paper and mint tea.

**At the Table**: You can run this NPC across entire campaigns, evolving their relationships and pursuing their goals dynamically.

## NPC Relationship and Motivation Tools {#npc-relationship-tools}

Use these tools to track how NPCs relate to PCs and how those relationships evolve through play.

### NPC Attitude Table {#attitude-table}

**Hostile**: Actively opposes PCs. Will obstruct, attack, or undermine. Requires significant incentive or pressure to cooperate.

**Unfriendly**: Distrusts or dislikes PCs. Won't help without clear benefit. Might provide minimal cooperation if forced.

**Neutral**: No strong opinion. Transactional and professional. Will help if fairly compensated or if it aligns with their interests.

**Friendly**: Likes or respects PCs. Provides reasonable help without requiring payment. Won't take significant personal risk unless relationship deepens.

**Allied**: Trusts PCs and shares goals. Will take risks to help. Expects reciprocal support.

**Usage**: Start most NPCs at Neutral unless context dictates otherwise. Adjust attitude based on PC actions—successful Persuasion, fulfilling promises, or helping with NPC goals shifts toward Friendly or Allied. Breaking trust, threats, or opposing NPC goals shifts toward Unfriendly or Hostile.

### Influence Tracking {#influence-tracking}

Track PC influence with important NPCs using a simple clock or point system:

**Influence Clock** (4-6 segments): Each positive interaction or favor completed fills a segment. When full, the NPC shifts attitude one step toward Allied or provides a significant benefit (information, resource access, protection).

**Negative Influence**: Betrayals, failed promises, or opposition can drain influence or shift attitudes backward.

**Usage**: This creates visible progress in relationships and gives players concrete feedback on social investment. Particularly effective for faction representatives or recurring allies where relationship building matters.

### NPC Evolution Guidance {#npc-evolution}

NPCs should change based on PC actions and campaign events. Use these principles:

**React to PC Behavior**: NPCs notice how PCs treat them and others. Consistent respect builds trust. Casual disregard breeds resentment. Let attitudes shift naturally.

**Pursue Goals Actively**: NPCs don't wait for PCs to act. Advance NPC goals in the background. If PCs ignore an ally's request for help, that ally might solve it themselves, hire someone else, or face consequences.

**Create Pressure Points**: Give NPCs things they care about that PCs can threaten or protect—family, reputation, resources, ideals. This creates leverage and stakes.

**Allow Transformation**: Rivals can become allies when facing common threats. Informants can evolve into friends if treated fairly. Antagonists can be redeemed or defeated and replaced. Allies can become rivals if PCs repeatedly ignore their needs.

**Mark Milestones**: When significant events occur (PC saves NPC's life, NPC betrays PC trust, shared victory, tragic loss), mark it and adjust the relationship accordingly.
