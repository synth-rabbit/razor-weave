## Session Zero Agenda {#session-zero-agenda}

- Safety check‑in: lines/veils, tone, red card protocol
- Theme & tone: supported playstyles; examples of scenes we want/avoid
- Table cadence: spotlight rotation, rulings (stakes before dice), visible state
- Advancement expectations: pace and what “getting stronger” looks like here
- Scheduling and logistics: session length, recap rhythm, notes

## Party Composition {#party-composition}

Coverage and spotlight

- Roles and coverage: can the party pursue plans without a single gate?
- Spotlight rules: rotate; invite quieter players first after resets
- Safety valve: define how the party retreats or trades time for safety

GM usage

- Ask for a party statement: “What do you do well together?”
- If a gap is risky (e.g., no social leverage), plan an early hook to cover it

## Character Build Flow {#character-build-flow}

Walk players through choices; confirm what you need to adjudicate fairly.

Checklist

- Concept → Role at the table
- Skills/Proficiencies: what they’re best at; what’s weak
- Tags/Conditions they bring or resist (e.g., Night‑Sight, Cloistered)
- Gear/resources that change position (climbing kit, smoke, rally horn)
- Flag: a personal hook the GM may pull (owed favor, rival, goal)

## Linking PCs {#linking-pcs}

Create two links per PC: one practical, one personal.

Prompts

- You owe them: debt, teaching, shared loss
- You trust them for: a skill, a secret, a promise
- You fear for them because: a weakness or enemy

GM usage

- Turn links into immediate advantages (advantage on aid) or costs (Heat +1)

## First Adventure Hooks {#first-adventure-hooks}

Pick 3–5 hooks and tailor to the chosen tone.

- The Festival Permit: save the parade (Social/Logistics)
- The Sunken Cloister: retrieve the reliquary before tide (Exploration)
- Warehouse Ledger: seize and decode a smuggling ledger (Combat/Downtime)
- Bridge Gate Push: force the gate to protect evacuees (Set Piece)
- Threading the Heist: invite → infiltrate → extract (Multi‑Scene)
