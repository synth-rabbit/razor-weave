## Welcome to Narrative Craft {#welcome-to-narrative-craft}

The Storyteller Guide teaches you to craft compelling narratives at the table. While the GM Guide
focuses on mechanics, procedures, and rulings, this guide focuses on the narrative tools that
transform individual scenes into meaningful stories: theme, pacing, character arcs, and campaign
structure.

Storytelling in tabletop roleplaying is a collaborative craft. You are not writing a novel or
scripting a screenplay. You are creating a framework that allows player choices to matter, weaving
their actions into coherent arcs with rising tension, meaningful stakes, and satisfying resolutions.
This guide gives you the tools to do that work confidently and flexibly.

Think of the Storyteller Guide as your narrative toolkit. Where the GM Guide answers "How do I run
this scene?" and "What does this mechanic do?", this guide answers "How do I structure this arc?",
"What makes this moment meaningful?", and "How do I maintain momentum across six sessions?"

You do not need to read this guide cover to cover. Each chapter is designed to stand alone and
address specific narrative challenges. Use the reading paths below to find the chapters that match
your current needs, then integrate those techniques into your table practice.

## What's in This Guide {#whats-in-this-guide}

This guide is organized into three major sections:

**Narrative Foundations** (Chapters 1-6): Core storytelling concepts including narrative structure,
theme, character arcs, pacing, and campaign frameworks. Start here if you are new to narrative GMing
or want to strengthen your foundational techniques.

**Advanced Techniques** (Chapters 7-12): Specialized tools including mechanics as story devices,
improvisation, mysteries, social conflict, and faction dynamics. Use these chapters to deepen your
craft and tackle specific campaign challenges.

**Genre-Specific Guidance** (Chapters 13-15): Tailored advice for horror, cozy, and epic fantasy
campaigns. Each genre chapter includes worked examples, pacing considerations, and mechanical
adjustments.

**Planning & Troubleshooting** (Chapters 16-18): Practical tools for arc planning, troubleshooting
common problems, and quick reference sheets. Keep these chapters handy during prep and between
sessions.

Unlike the GM Guide, which emphasizes mechanical procedures and rulings, the Storyteller Guide
emphasizes narrative craft: structure, meaning, and collaborative storytelling. Unlike the Player
Guide, which focuses on character creation and player-facing mechanics, this guide focuses on the
GM's unique narrative responsibilities: framing scenes, managing pacing, and weaving player choices
into coherent arcs.

## How to Use This Guide {#how-to-use-this-guide}

Choose a reading path based on your current needs:

**New to Narrative GMing**: Start with Chapters 2 (Narrative Structure), 3 (Theme, Stakes, and
Meaning), and 5 (Pacing and Momentum). These three chapters give you a solid foundation for
structuring scenes, sequences, and arcs. Then read Chapter 8 (Session Zero) before your first
session.

**Experienced GM Seeking Campaign Tools**: Start with Chapter 6 (Campaign Frameworks) to choose a
campaign structure, then read Chapter 16 (Campaign Arc Planning) for practical planning tools. Add
Chapter 4 (Character Arcs) and Chapter 12 (Faction Dynamics) to support player-driven narrative.

**Building Mystery or Intrigue Campaigns**: Read Chapter 10 (Mysteries and Intrigue), Chapter 11
(Social Conflict and Negotiation), and Chapter 12 (Faction Dynamics) in sequence. These chapters
build on each other to create information-driven, social-focused campaigns.

**Running Genre-Specific Campaigns**: Start with your genre chapter (13 for Horror, 14 for Cozy, 15
for Epic Fantasy), then read Chapter 7 (Mechanics as Story Tools) to customize mechanics for your
genre. Add Chapter 6 (Campaign Frameworks) to choose your structural approach.

**Troubleshooting Stalled Campaigns**: Read Chapter 17 (Storytelling Troubleshooting) for diagnostic
questions and intervention techniques. Then revisit Chapters 5 (Pacing) and 4 (Character Arcs) to
re-engage player interest.

## Integration with Other Guides {#integration-with-other-guides}

The Storyteller Guide integrates with the other core books:

**GM Guide**: Provides mechanical procedures and scene-level guidance. When the Storyteller Guide
discusses narrative structure, consult the GM Guide for the mechanical procedures that support each
scene (see GM Guide Chapter 5: Scene Structure and Chapter 6: Mechanics Overview).

**Player Guide**: Defines character creation, progression, and player-facing mechanics. When
designing character arcs (Chapter 4), reference Player Guide Chapter 6 (Progression) for mechanical
milestones and Chapter 5 (Character Creation) for flags and bonds.

**Mechanics Reference**: Comprehensive rules for tags, conditions, clocks, and advanced systems.
When using mechanics as story tools (Chapter 7), consult the Mechanics Reference for detailed rules
and edge cases.

Use this guide alongside the GM Guide during prep. The GM Guide tells you how to run individual
scenes; this guide tells you how to connect those scenes into meaningful arcs. Use the Player Guide
during Session Zero to align character creation with campaign themes. Use the Mechanics Reference
when you need to customize or extend the core mechanics for narrative purposes.

## Example Signals {#example-signals}

Throughout this guide, you will encounter these signals:

**Worked Examples**: Complete scenarios showing techniques in practice. Each example includes setup,
execution, and outcomes. Use these as templates for your own table.

**GM Usage**: Practical bullet points for immediate table use. These are the "how to use this now"
takeaways for each technique.

**Cross-References**: Links to related chapters and other core books. Follow these to deepen your
understanding or find related techniques.

**Callouts**: Brief asides highlighting common pitfalls, advanced techniques, or table-tested tips.
Read these for nuance and troubleshooting.

**Templates and Checklists**: Ready-to-use tools for prep and play. Print these or keep them on
screen for quick reference during sessions.

The Storyteller Guide is a living document. As you use these techniques at your table, you will
discover what works for your group and develop your own narrative style. Treat this guide as a
starting point, not a prescription. The best storytelling emerges from understanding principles and
adapting them to your table's unique needs.
