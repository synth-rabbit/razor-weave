## What You Must Know {#what-you-must-know}

- The loop: Ask → Declare → Judge → Resolve → Update → Ask.
- Pick DCs from fiction: leverage, risk, tools, tags.
- Pre‑state stakes: Full/Partial/Fail beats before rolling.
- Always move forward: failures change state; they do not stall.
- Keep state visible: clocks, tags, conditions on the table.

## The Dice System {#the-dice-system}

This game uses **4d6** (four six-sided dice) as its core resolution mechanic. Here's what you need to know as GM:

**Basic Roll**: Player rolls 4d6, sums all dice, adds relevant bonus, compares to DC you set. The roll averages 14 (before bonuses), creating a bell curve where most results cluster near the middle while extremes remain rare.

**Advantage/Disadvantage**: These modify the dice pool, not the DC.

- **Advantage** comes in two levels: +1 (roll 5d6, keep best 4) or +2 (roll 6d6, keep best 4)
- **Disadvantage** comes in two levels: -1 (roll 5d6, keep worst 4) or -2 (roll 6d6, keep worst 4)
- Multiple sources net out, capping at ±2 levels. If a character has both, they cancel (e.g., +1 advantage and -1 disadvantage = roll normally)

**Outcome Tiers by Margin**: Calculate Roll - DC to get the margin:

- **Critical Success**: Margin ≥+5 (spectacularly exceeded)
- **Full Success**: Margin ≥0 (cleanly achieved)
- **Partial Success**: Margin -1 to -2 (achieved with cost)
- **Failure**: Margin ≤-3 (goal not achieved, situation escalates)
- **Critical Failure**: Margin ≤-7 OR all 1s rolled (disaster)

**GM Usage**: You never roll for the world—you set DCs and interpret results. When players roll, you translate margins into fiction. A margin of +8 isn't "you rolled high"—it's "you pick the lock silently, find a hidden compartment, and recognize the maker's mark."

**Detailed rules**: See [Rolling Dice](../mechanics_reference/chapters/02-core-concepts.md#rolling-dice) in Mechanics Reference for complete mechanics with examples.

## DC Ladder & Outcome Tiers {#dc-ladder--outcome-tiers}

DC cues (pick what the fiction suggests)

- 12 Easy: safe, aided, trivial with time
- 14 Routine: standard challenge, normal tools
- 16 Tough: notable risk, bad angle, poor tools
- 18 Hard: steep odds, strong opposition, tight window
- 20 Heroic: exceptional, stacked against, slim margin
- 22 Legendary: near impossible without setup or luck

Outcome tiers (translate into fiction)

- Full: objective achieved cleanly; tick progress or gain position
- Partial: progress with cost; fill pressure you pre‑stated or apply a tag
- Fail: no progress; escalate danger; reveal a new obstacle or cost
- Crits: amplify change; on crit success consider clearing a minor tag

## Advantage/Disadvantage & Position {#advantagedisadvantage--position}

Grant Advantage when approach, tools, or setup meaningfully help. Impose
Disadvantage when space, time, or attention meaningfully hinder. Position
describes how safe and effective a move is; shift position first, then pick
numbers. Create Advantage by setting up, controlling space, or getting help.

Micro cues

- Advantage: elevated angle, quiet space, expert tools, ally assist
- Disadvantage: cramped footing, loud crowd, bad light, rushed timing

## Tags & Conditions as Levers {#tags--conditions-as-levers}

Tags describe the environment or temporary states (Dim, Slick, Cramped, Fragile
Cover). Conditions change a character’s capabilities (Exhausted, Restrained,
Bleeding). Apply them when outcomes change reality; show clear ways to clear or
mitigate.

GM usage

- Name 1–2 meaningful tags per scene; make effects explicit
- On Partial, prefer adding a tag or ticking pressure over denial
- Offer clears: first aid, time, leverage, change of approach

## Clocks & Resources {#clocks--resources}

Use paired clocks to pace progress and pressure. Pick sizes from tempo (4/6/8).
Fill progress on Full; tick pressure on Partial/Fail as pre‑stated. Resources
(gear, spell slots, favors) are levers: spend to change position or DCs.

Patterns

- Short scenes: 4 progress, 4 pressure
- Standard scenes: 6 progress, 6 pressure
- Set pieces: 8 progress, 6 pressure (pressure resolves faster)

## Group Checks & Contests {#group-checks--contests}

Group checks

- Majority: succeed if most do; Partial if split
- All‑Must‑Succeed: use when a single failure breaks the attempt
- Leader‑with‑Help: leader rolls; up to +2 aid dice from helpers

Contests

- Both sides roll; higher total wins; ties are Partial by default
- Pre‑state what Full/Partial/Fail mean for each side

## GM Usage Quicklist {#gm-usage-quicklist}

- Say stakes before dice; pick DC from fiction
- Map tier to fiction; update tags, conditions, clocks
- Prefer costs that move the story; offer clears
- Rotate spotlight; keep passes short; ask again
