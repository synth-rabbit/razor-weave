## Exploration — The Sunken Cloister {#ex-sunken-cloister}

Setup: A flooded cloister lies beneath a ruined chapel. The party seeks a
sealed reliquary before the night tide seals the passages.

Tags: Dim, Waist‑Deep Water, Slick Stone. Clocks: Progress — Reliquary Found
(6); Pressure — Tide & Vermin (6).

Framing: “Full: you chart a safe path and reach the reliquary quickly. Partial:
you advance, but time and noise draw vermin. Fail: you lose time or footing,
and the cloister fights back.” GM Callout: name the water and stone as levers
that shift Advantage/Disadvantage between stealth and movement.

Checks (examples)

- Survey/Navigation (DC 16, Tough): read stonework and currents
- Stealth (DC 14, Routine): keep kit from clanking and splashing
- Athletics (DC 16, Tough): lift a fallen beam in the passage

Outcomes (Survey/Navigation)

- Full: Tick Reliquary 2; note a pattern of carved fish pointing the way
- Partial: Tick Reliquary 1 and Tide & Vermin 1; add Tag: Off‑Route
- Fail: No progress; Tide & Vermin +2; Condition: Soaked or Strap Snapped

GM Usage: Dim can grant Advantage to stealth at the cost of speed; Off‑Route
offers a later clear on a critical success. On Partial, tick the pre‑stated
pressure; avoid dead ends. Follow‑up: “Press quickly with noise, or slow your
breathing and lose time?”

## Social — The Minister’s Audience {#ex-ministers-audience}

Setup: The party needs an emergency export waiver from the Trade Minister. The
antechamber is crowded; aides guard the schedule.

Tags: Crowded, Formal Protocol. Clock: Pressure — Scrutiny (6).

Framing: “Full: you earn a same‑day waiver. Partial: you get a waiver with
strings (narrowed scope or a favor). Fail: your request is flagged and stalled.”
GM Callout: invite setup actions to reduce noise or gain a vouching ally before
the main ask.

Checks (examples)

- Negotiation (DC 16, Tough): case for urgency and fairness
- Streetwise (DC 14, Routine): locate a friendly aide who can vouch
- Event Planning (DC 14, Routine): present a route and safety contingencies

Outcomes (Negotiation)

- Full: Waiver granted; note an aide contact for future pulls
- Partial: Waiver granted with strings; Scrutiny +1
- Fail: Waiver delayed; Scrutiny +2; Tag: Flagged Request

GM Usage: Crowded raises DCs for serious asks unless space is controlled or a
vouch is secured. Offer clear tradeoffs: accept a narrower window for speed, or
do a small favor to clear Flagged Request. Follow‑up: “Secure a quiet alcove or
work the line for a vouch?”

## Combat — Rail Yard Skirmish {#ex-rail-yard-skirmish}

Setup: Smugglers scatter among freight and ladders at a midnight rail yard. The
party wants to seize a shipment ledger before reinforcements arrive.

Tags: Solid Cover (Freight), Elevated, Dim. Clocks: Progress — Ledger Secured
(4); Pressure — Reinforcements (6).

Ordering: Use popcorn to keep tension high; declare who follows after each
action. Invite Set Up to create angles and degrade cover.

Checks (examples)

- Set Up (DC 14, Routine): climb a ladder for an angle or swing a lamp for light
- Maneuver (DC 16, Tough): shove or flank to break a screen
- Strike (contest): attack from angle vs cover and defender

Outcomes (Strike from angle)

- Full: Tick Ledger 2; Fragile cover degrades to Spent
- Partial: Tick Ledger 1; Reinforcements +1; Tag: Exposed Position
- Fail: No progress; Reinforcements +2; Condition: Suppressed

GM Usage: Telegraph how to flip levers (light, height, cover). On Partial,
prefer pressure or state changes over denial. Follow‑up: “Withdraw to clear
Suppressed, or press with a Set Up to flip Exposed?”

## Downtime — Workshop Season {#ex-workshop-season}

Setup: Between missions, the party works to restore a storm‑damaged workshop.
They also gather intel on the ledgers.

Project Clock: Workshop Restored (6). Complication Clock: Heat (6).

Checks (per pass)

- Craft/Repair (DC 16, Tough): progress on the restoration
- Research (DC 14, Routine): decode a symbol and reduce future DCs via notes
- Contacts (DC 14, Routine): find a discreet buyer for the seized ledgers

Outcomes per pass

- Full: Tick Workshop 2; note a useful tool or safety improvement
- Partial: Tick Workshop 1 and Heat 1 (pre‑stated complication)
- Fail: Heat +2; Tag: Tipped Hand (social checks +2 DC until cleared)

GM Usage: Offer options to clear complications: a side scene to reduce Heat or
to spend favors on repairs. Follow‑up: “Press the build this week, or take a
meeting to cool Heat?”

## Multi‑Scene — Threading the Heist {#ex-threading-the-heist}

Setup: A three‑beat heist: acquire an invite, infiltrate during a gala, and
extract with the ledger intact. Show clean transitions and visible state.

Beat 1 — Acquire the Invite (Social)

Tags: Crowded, Music. Clock: Scrutiny (6).

Checks: Performance (DC 14) to impress; Negotiation (DC 16) for the ask;
Streetwise (DC 14) to find a sympathetic usher.

Outcomes (Negotiation)

- Full: Clean invite; usher friend noted
- Partial: Invite with strings (time‑boxed or access limited); Scrutiny +1
- Fail: No invite now; Scrutiny +2; Tag: Flagged

Transition: The invite’s limit sets a time window for infiltration; show Scrutiny on the table.

Beat 2 — Infiltration (Exploration/Stealth)

Tags: Dim, Crowded Corridors. Clocks: Progress — Vault Reached (6); Pressure —
Attention (6).

Checks: Stealth (DC 14) to move through the crowd; Survey (DC 16) to map a
short path; Set Up (DC 14) to create a diversion.

Outcomes (Stealth)

- Full: Tick Vault 2; pass unnoticed
- Partial: Tick Vault 1 and Attention 1; Tag: Exposed Position
- Fail: No progress; Attention +2; Condition: Winded

Transition: At vault, resolve access using setup from Beat 1; Exposed Position
lingers unless cleared.

Beat 3 — Extraction (Combat/Pursuit)

Tags: Elevated Walkway, Fragile Cover. Clocks: Progress — Extraction (4);
Pressure — Reinforcements (6).

Note: If Exposed Position remains from prior beats, apply its effect to the
first contest until cleared by fiction.

Checks: Maneuver (DC 16) to leap between cars; Strike (contest) to break a
screen; Defend/Withdraw to reset.

Outcomes (Maneuver)

- Full: Tick Extraction 2; gain cover
- Partial: Tick Extraction 1; Reinforcements +1; Tag: Off‑Balance
- Fail: No progress; Reinforcements +2; Condition: Shaken

GM Usage: Keep clocks visible across beats; let prior tags/conditions carry
forward unless cleared by fiction. Offer an exit at Extraction 3+: “Slip away
now or push for the full clear?”
