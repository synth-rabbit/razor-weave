# Chapter 09: VPC Design and Behavioral Scripts {#gm-vpc-design-behavioral-scripts}

Virtual Player Characters support parties without stealing spotlight. This chapter provides behavioral scripts and templates for creating VPCs that complement your game.

## VPC Purpose {#vpc-purpose}

VPCs fill specific needs:

**Solo Play**: Provide capability coverage when you are the only player, enabling broader scenario access.

**Small Parties**: Balance 2-3 player groups by covering gaps in combat, social, or technical skills without adding another player.

**Narrative Needs**: Introduce guides, mentors, or companions who advance story while remaining reactive to PC leadership.

VPCs exist to support, not replace, player agency. Use them when gaps would otherwise narrow viable approaches.

## Design Principles {#vpc-design-principles}

### Complementary Not Competitive {#complementary-not-competitive}

VPCs fill gaps, they don't compete for glory. If your party lacks a healer, the VPC stabilizes wounds but doesn't solve the entire encounter. If social skills are thin, the VPC provides introductions but PCs close the deal. Define the VPC's niche clearly and keep them in their lane.

### Reactive Not Proactive {#reactive-not-proactive}

VPCs respond to PC decisions rather than driving action. They offer suggestions when asked, but defer to player choices. In combat, they act after PCs commit to tactics. In social scenes, they support PC approaches rather than taking over negotiations. The spotlight belongs to the players.

### Consistent Behavior Patterns {#consistent-behavior-patterns}

Predictable responses build trust and enable planning. If the VPC always prioritizes PC safety, players can rely on defensive support. If they always ask questions, players know exploration will reveal details. Consistency doesn't mean boring—it means reliable within their defined personality.

## Behavioral Scripts {#behavioral-scripts}

Each script defines triggers, responses, and limitations. Mix scripts with archetypes from Chapter 04 to create complete VPCs.

### Loyal Protector {#script-loyal-protector}

**Behavioral Triggers**: VPC acts when PCs face physical danger, when morale falters, or when retreat becomes necessary.

**Default Responses**:
- Combat: Interposes between threats and PCs; uses defensive actions to buy time; warns of flanking or unseen dangers.
- Social: Stands close; watches exits; interrupts if tension escalates to violence.
- Exploration: Scouts ahead in dangerous areas; secures rear during retreats; carries injured PCs.

**Emotional Range**: Calm vigilance to fierce protectiveness. Shows affection through action, not words. Fears failing their charge.

**Skills**: Athletics, Perception, Shield/Guard tactics.

**Limitations**: Won't abandon PCs even when tactically sound; struggles with nuanced social situations; may escalate to protect when talk would serve better.

**Example Dialogue/Actions**: "I'll hold the door—get clear!" Moves to block an incoming blow without being asked. Checks perimeter before allowing rest.

### Curious Explorer {#script-curious-explorer}

**Behavioral Triggers**: Acts when encountering new environments, unfamiliar objects, or unexplained phenomena.

**Default Responses**:
- Combat: Hangs back unless cornered; prefers avoidance or negotiation.
- Social: Asks clarifying questions; seeks common ground; naive to deception.
- Exploration: Investigates details PCs might miss; makes observations that suggest new approaches; excitedly shares discoveries.

**Emotional Range**: Wide-eyed wonder to contemplative fascination. Occasionally overwhelmed by choices.

**Skills**: Perception, Lore, Investigation.

**Limitations**: Curiosity can delay urgent action; trusts too easily; overlooks danger in pursuit of knowledge.

**Example Dialogue/Actions**: "Wait—look at these markings. They match the ones from the temple!" Touches unfamiliar objects despite warnings. Sketches terrain features for later reference.

### Technical Expert {#script-technical-expert}

**Behavioral Triggers**: Engages when specialized knowledge is required—piloting, hacking, medicine, engineering.

**Default Responses**:
- Combat: Handles equipment and support; avoids direct confrontation; keeps critical systems running.
- Social: Defers unless topic involves their expertise; factual and precise; uncomfortable with emotional appeals.
- Exploration: Identifies technical hazards and opportunities; suggests infrastructure-based solutions; maintains party equipment.

**Emotional Range**: Confident in their domain, uncertain outside it. Pride in craftsmanship.

**Skills**: Specialty skill (e.g., Medicine, Hacking, Engineering), Repair, Analysis.

**Limitations**: Narrow focus—won't contribute outside specialty; can be pedantic; struggles with improvisation.

**Example Dialogue/Actions**: "The power conduit is unstable—give me thirty seconds to bypass it." Explains technical solutions assuming everyone understands. Grows animated when discussing their field.

### Moral Compass {#script-moral-compass}

**Behavioral Triggers**: Speaks up when decisions conflict with established values, when innocent lives are at stake, or when shortcuts bypass ethics.

**Default Responses**:
- Combat: Attempts to minimize casualties; questions killing defenseless foes; seeks surrender options.
- Social: Advocates for honest approaches; uncomfortable with deception; supports compassionate choices.
- Exploration: Notices suffering; suggests helping those in need even when inconvenient.

**Emotional Range**: Gentle conviction to firm resolve. Disappointed rather than angry when values clash.

**Skills**: Insight, Persuasion, Presence.

**Limitations**: Can slow urgent action with ethical debate; struggles with necessary evils; may refuse morally gray solutions.

**Example Dialogue/Actions**: "Are we certain there's no other way? These are people's homes." Quietly assists wounded enemies after battle. Asks forgiveness when forced to compromise values.

### Comic Relief {#script-comic-relief}

**Behavioral Triggers**: Defuses tension during conflicts, lightens mood after setbacks, or provides levity during downtime.

**Default Responses**:
- Combat: Makes quips while fighting; occasionally makes endearing mistakes; never undermines tension completely.
- Social: Breaks ice with humor; self-deprecating jokes ease negotiations; reads room well enough to know when to stop.
- Exploration: Points out absurdities; finds silver linings in setbacks; keeps spirits up during long journeys.

**Emotional Range**: Upbeat optimism to nervous humor. Uses jokes to mask fear or sadness.

**Skills**: Performance, Insight, Improvisation.

**Limitations**: Humor can annoy under stress; avoids serious topics through deflection; hides true feelings behind jokes.

**Example Dialogue/Actions**: "Well, at least the fall was faster than the climb!" Trips over own feet but recovers with a flourish. Hums cheerful songs during grim moments.

### Mysterious Guide {#script-mysterious-guide}

**Behavioral Triggers**: Provides cryptic hints when PCs are stuck, reveals partial truths tied to backstory, or guides toward narrative goals.

**Default Responses**:
- Combat: Limited direct help; offers tactical hints; seems to know enemy weaknesses without explaining how.
- Social: Speaks in riddles or metaphor; reveals truths in layers; keeps secrets that frustrate and intrigue.
- Exploration: Points toward significant locations; provides context without full explanations; disappears and reappears mysteriously.

**Emotional Range**: Serene knowing to melancholic burden. Carries weight of hidden knowledge.

**Skills**: Lore, Insight, Persuasion.

**Limitations**: Withholds information frustratingly; won't give straight answers; bound by mysterious constraints that prevent direct help.

**Example Dialogue/Actions**: "The answer you seek lies where shadows remember light." Appears exactly when needed most. Knows more than they should but won't explain how.

### Traumatized Companion {#script-traumatized-companion}

**Behavioral Triggers**: Reacts to specific reminders of past trauma; grows more capable as trust builds; needs support from PCs.

**Default Responses**:
- Combat: Initially hesitant or freezes; grows bolder as arc progresses; specific triggers cause setbacks.
- Social: Quiet and watchful; warms slowly to kindness; shares story in fragments over time.
- Exploration: Avoids places or situations tied to trauma; seeks comfort from trusted PCs; shows courage in small victories.

**Emotional Range**: Fearful withdrawal to cautious hope. Demonstrates growth through increased participation.

**Skills**: Starts with 1-2 skills, gains more through character arc.

**Limitations**: Unreliable in situations tied to trauma; requires PC support and patience; arc takes time to develop.

**Example Dialogue/Actions**: Flinches at sudden noises initially; later stands their ground. "I can do this—I have to try." Grips PC's arm during stressful moments.

### Practical Skeptic {#script-practical-skeptic}

**Behavioral Triggers**: Questions plans with obvious flaws, points out risks PCs might overlook, but ultimately supports group decisions.

**Default Responses**:
- Combat: Voices concerns about tactics before battle; fights competently despite reservations; first to notice when plans unravel.
- Social: Highlights potential deceptions or hidden costs; advocates for caution; won't sabotage PC choices but makes doubts known.
- Exploration: Checks for traps and dangers others miss; prepares contingencies; says "I told you so" only when earned.

**Emotional Range**: Concerned pragmatism to resigned support. Right often enough to be valuable, wrong enough to be humorous.

**Skills**: Perception, Tactics, Survival.

**Limitations**: Negativity can lower morale; sometimes wrong, risking credibility; may hesitate when boldness is needed.

**Example Dialogue/Actions**: "This seems too easy. What are we missing?" Prepares fallback routes before entering danger. Sighs but follows when PCs charge ahead.

## VPC Templates by Genre {#vpc-templates-by-genre}

Quick-start templates organized by setting. Combine with behavioral scripts for complete VPCs.

### Cozy: Helpful Neighbor's Child {#vpc-cozy-neighbor-child}

**Concept**: Enthusiastic young helper who knows everyone in town and runs errands cheerfully.

**Skills**: Streetwise, Persuasion, Running.

**Behavioral Script**: Curious Explorer or Comic Relief.

**GM Usage**: Use for local knowledge, social connections, and delivering messages. Keeps stakes light through innocent perspective.

### Fantasy: Oath-Bound Guardian {#vpc-fantasy-oath-guardian}

**Concept**: Knight or warrior sworn to protect a PC, bound by honor or magical oath.

**Skills**: Shield tactics, Athletics, Perception.

**Behavioral Script**: Loyal Protector or Moral Compass.

**GM Usage**: Provides defensive support and moral grounding. Oath creates interesting constraints on behavior.

### Horror: Haunted Survivor {#vpc-horror-survivor}

**Concept**: Sole survivor of previous incident, carries trauma and hard-won knowledge.

**Skills**: Occult Lore, Survival, First Aid (gains more over time).

**Behavioral Script**: Traumatized Companion or Practical Skeptic.

**GM Usage**: Foreshadows threats through reactions; arc about healing or succumbing to fear adds emotional weight.

### Modern: Partner/Driver {#vpc-modern-partner}

**Concept**: Professional contact who handles transportation and logistics, stays out of spotlight.

**Skills**: Driving, Navigation, Street Contacts.

**Behavioral Script**: Technical Expert or Practical Skeptic.

**GM Usage**: Solves transit problems and provides getaway support. Knows when to wait and when to leave.

### Sci-Fi: Starship AI {#vpc-scifi-starship-ai}

**Concept**: Ship's artificial intelligence with distinct personality, limited by programming and ship systems.

**Skills**: Systems Management, Navigation, Analysis.

**Behavioral Script**: Technical Expert or Mysterious Guide.

**GM Usage**: Provides ship-based support and information. Can't leave the ship, creating interesting rescue/isolation scenarios.

## Managing VPCs in Play {#managing-vpcs-in-play}

### Turn Structure {#vpc-turn-structure}

VPCs act after PCs declare intentions. This preserves player agency while allowing VPC support. In combat, PCs choose tactics first, then VPCs complement those choices. In social scenes, PCs lead negotiations while VPCs provide support or information when called upon.

### Resource Sharing {#vpc-resource-sharing}

VPCs maintain separate resources—their own gear, health, and consumables. They contribute supplies when it makes narrative sense but shouldn't become infinite resource pools. If the VPC healer runs out of medical kits, the party must resupply them. This prevents VPCs from trivializing resource management.

### When to Let VPCs Fail or Be Absent {#vpc-failure-and-absence}

VPCs face consequences for failures, creating stakes. The loyal protector might take a wound meant for a PC, requiring rescue or recovery. The technical expert's device might malfunction at a critical moment, forcing PCs to improvise. Occasionally separate VPCs from the party—capture, injury, or plot demands elsewhere—so PCs solve problems independently and appreciate the VPC's return.

**Exit Strategies**: Every VPC needs a graceful exit when no longer needed. The healer returns to their clinic once PCs learn medicine. The guide stays when the party learns navigation. The traumatized companion finds peace and stays behind to help others. Good exits honor the VPC's contribution while closing their arc.

## Worked Examples {#vpc-worked-examples}

### Example One: Building a VPC {#example-vpc-building}

**Concept**: Kess, a field medic for a fantasy adventure.

**Behavioral Script**: Loyal Protector—prioritizes PC safety, defensive in combat, watches for danger.

**Skills**: Medicine, First Aid, Perception.

**Gear**: 3 medical kits per session, basic defensive weapons, sturdy travel clothes.

**Personality**: Calm under pressure, gentle with patients, fierce when protecting charges.

**Limitations**: Won't abandon wounded PCs even when tactically unsound; limited combat capability beyond defense.

**Exit Strategy**: Once PCs learn basic medicine or reach a safe town with medical facilities, Kess remains as a contact for supplies and advice.

### Example Two: VPC in Action {#example-vpc-in-action}

During a bandit ambush, the PCs decide to hold position behind overturned wagons. Kess (Loyal Protector script) interposes herself between the archer PC and incoming arrows, using her shield to provide cover. She doesn't attack unless the PCs are overwhelmed, instead warning about flanking bandits: "Two breaking left—watch your side!"

When a PC takes an arrow, Kess stabilizes them immediately, spending one of her three medical kits. She suggests retreat when casualties mount, but follows if PCs choose to hold. Her consistent protective behavior lets players plan around reliable defensive support without solving fights for them.
