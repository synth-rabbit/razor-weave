## Mystery Design Fundamentals {#mystery-design-fundamentals}

Mystery campaigns are about revelation and discovery.
Players gather information, connect dots, and uncover truths.
Designing mysteries for TTRPGs differs from novels: players must feel clever,
and the path to revelation must be robust enough to survive improvisation and failed checks.

Two principles underpin good mystery design:

1. **The Three-Clue Rule**: Every critical revelation needs at least three independent paths
   leading to it. If players miss one clue, two others remain. This prevents single points of
   failure.
2. **Node-Based Design**: Structure mysteries as webs of interconnected information nodes
   (locations, NPCs, clues), not linear sequences. Players can approach nodes in any order,
   discovering different clues depending on their path.

### The Three-Clue Rule {#the-three-clue-rule}

The Three-Clue Rule is a safety net.
Critical information must have multiple paths to discovery.
If learning "the mayor is the killer" requires only one clue (a journal in the mayor's office),
and players never search the office, the mystery stalls.

**How to Apply**:

1. **Identify Critical Revelations**: What must players learn to progress?
   (Example: The killer's identity, the artifact's location, the cult's goal.)
2. **Create Three Paths**: For each revelation, create three independent clues or sources.
   Spread them across different locations, NPCs, or investigation types.
3. **Test Independence**: Ensure each clue is findable independently.
   If Clue A requires finding Clue B first, they are not independent.

**Example**: Critical revelation: The mayor is the killer.

- **Clue 1**: A witness saw someone matching the mayor's description near the crime scene.
- **Clue 2**: The murder weapon (a rare dagger) matches one missing from the mayor's collection.
- **Clue 3**: A coded letter found at the victim's home, when deciphered, references "the town's
  leader."

Players can find any one, two, or all three clues. Each points to the mayor. Missing one does not
derail the mystery.

### Node-Based Mystery Structure {#node-based-mystery-structure}

Node-based mysteries structure information as interconnected nodes. Each node (location, NPC, event)
contains clues or leads to other nodes. Players explore nodes in any order, discovering information
non-linearly.

**Nodes Include**:

- **Locations**: Crime scenes, suspects' homes, public places, hidden sites.
- **NPCs**: Witnesses, suspects, informants, investigators.
- **Events**: Auctions, meetings, confrontations, discoveries.

**Connections**: Nodes link to other nodes via leads. A clue at Node A points to Node B. An NPC at
Node C provides access to Node D. Players follow leads, building their understanding.

**Example Structure**:

- **Node A** (Crime Scene): Contains clues pointing to Node B (suspect's home) and Node D (witness).
- **Node B** (Suspect's Home): Contains clues pointing to Node C (hidden meeting place) and confirms
  suspicions from Node A.
- **Node C** (Hidden Meeting Place): Contains clues revealing the conspiracy and pointing to Node E
  (mastermind).
- **Node D** (Witness): Provides leads to Node A (crime scene details) and Node E (saw the
  mastermind).
- **Node E** (Mastermind): Final node where confrontation or revelation occurs.

Players can explore nodes in many orders: A → B → C, A → D → E, D → A → B → C → E. The web structure
supports exploration and prevents railroading.

GM usage:

- Design mysteries with three independent clues for each critical revelation
- Use node-based structures to allow non-linear investigation
- Ensure nodes connect via leads; no isolated or unreachable nodes
- Test your mystery: Can players reach critical revelations via multiple paths?
- Embrace player-driven exploration; let them choose which leads to follow

## Clue Types and Information Flow {#clue-types-and-information-flow}

Not all clues are equal. Different clue types serve different purposes. Understanding clue types
helps you pace information flow and create satisfying revelations.

### Core Clues {#core-clues}

**Core clues** are essential to solving the mystery. They point directly to critical revelations.
Core clues must be discoverable through multiple paths (Three-Clue Rule).

**Example Core Clues**:

- The murder weapon found at the scene (points to the killer's identity).
- A coded message revealing the conspiracy's goal.
- A witness who saw the culprit's face.

**Delivery**: Core clues should be easy to find if players investigate relevant nodes. Do not hide
core clues behind difficult checks or obscure reasoning. Use fail-forward design (see below): even
failed checks reveal core clues, possibly with complications.

### Supporting Clues {#supporting-clues}

**Supporting clues** add detail, confirm theories, or provide context. They are not essential but
enrich the mystery and make revelations more satisfying.

**Example Supporting Clues**:

- Background on the victim (motive, relationships, secrets).
- Details about the murder method (expertise required, timing).
- Evidence of the killer's movements (footprints, receipts, alibis).

**Delivery**: Supporting clues reward thorough investigation. They can be gated behind successful
checks or clever player questions. Missing supporting clues does not derail the mystery but reduces
confidence in conclusions.

### Red Herrings {#red-herrings}

**Red herrings** are false leads that misdirect players temporarily. Used carefully, they create
suspense and make revelations more satisfying. Overused, they frustrate players.

**Good Red Herrings**:

- Have plausible explanations when revealed as false.
- Lead somewhere interesting even if not to the solution (a red herring suspect has their own
  secrets).
- Do not waste excessive player time; reveal them as false relatively quickly.

**Example**: A suspect has no alibi and acts suspiciously. Players investigate and discover they
were smuggling contraband (illegal but unrelated to the murder). The red herring is resolved, and
players refocus on the real killer.

**Bad Red Herrings**:

- Have no explanation or payoff (arbitrary misdirection).
- Waste excessive time with no narrative benefit.
- Make players feel cheated when revealed.

**Usage**: Use red herrings sparingly. One or two per mystery adds complexity. Too many creates
frustration.

### Leads {#leads}

**Leads** are clues that point to other nodes. They guide investigation by suggesting where to go
next.

**Example Leads**:

- A business card found on the victim (points to an NPC node).
- A reference to a location (points to a location node).
- An NPC mentions another NPC (points to an interview node).

**Delivery**: Leads are abundant. Provide multiple leads at each node so players have choices. Let
players decide which leads to follow first.

GM usage:

- Distribute core clues across multiple paths; ensure they are discoverable
- Use supporting clues to reward thorough investigation and add depth
- Use red herrings sparingly; ensure they lead somewhere interesting
- Provide multiple leads at each node to guide player choices
- Balance information flow: reveal enough to maintain momentum without overwhelming players

## Investigation Structures {#investigation-structures}

Investigations can be structured as linear, node-based, or open. Each structure suits different
campaign styles and player preferences.

### Linear Investigations {#linear-investigations}

**Linear investigations** follow a sequence: Clue A leads to Clue B leads to Clue C leads to the
solution. Linear structure is simple and clear but risks railroading and single points of failure.

**When to Use**:

- One-shot mysteries with limited time.
- Introductory mysteries for new players.
- Tight, authored narratives with specific story beats.

**How to Mitigate Railroading**:

- Apply the Three-Clue Rule to each step.
- Use fail-forward design to prevent stalls.
- Allow player creativity to skip or reorder steps.

**Example**: The party investigates a theft. Clue A (witness description) leads to Clue B (suspect's
hideout) leads to Clue C (stolen goods) leads to the culprit's arrest. If players miss Clue A,
alternate paths (investigating the crime scene, asking informants) provide Clues B or C directly.

### Node-Based Investigations {#node-based-investigations}

**Node-based investigations** (described above) allow non-linear exploration. Players follow leads
in any order, discovering clues dynamically. This structure is flexible and robust.

**When to Use**:

- Campaign mysteries spanning multiple sessions.
- Mysteries emphasizing player-driven investigation.
- Complex conspiracies or multi-layered plots.

**How to Manage**:

- Map nodes and connections before play; use visual diagrams.
- Provide multiple leads at each node; let players choose direction.
- Track which nodes players have explored and which clues they have found.

**Example**: See the worked example (Node-Based Murder Mystery) below.

### Open Investigations {#open-investigations}

**Open investigations** are unstructured. Players investigate freely without predefined nodes or
leads. The GM improvises clues and leads based on player actions.

**When to Use**:

- Emergent, player-driven campaigns.
- Experienced players comfortable with open-ended exploration.
- Mysteries where the GM improvises solutions based on player theories.

**How to Manage**:

- Maintain flexible prep: NPC and location banks, modular clues.
- Listen to player theories; incorporate plausible ones into the solution.
- Use the Three-Clue Rule even when improvising; ensure revelations have support.

**Example**: Players investigate a haunting with no predefined solution. The GM listens to player
theories (ghost of a murder victim, residual magic, cursed artifact) and chooses the most
interesting one, then improvises clues supporting it.

GM usage:

- Choose investigation structures based on campaign style and player preferences
- Use linear structures for simplicity and tight narratives
- Use node-based structures for flexibility and player-driven investigation
- Use open structures for improvisation and emergent narrative
- Apply the Three-Clue Rule and fail-forward design across all structures

## Revelation Pacing {#revelation-pacing}

Revelation pacing determines when and how players learn answers. Good pacing maintains tension and
rewards investigation without withholding information arbitrarily.

### When to Reveal {#when-to-reveal}

**Early Revelations**: Reveal minor mysteries or partial answers early to build momentum and
confidence. Example: Session One reveals the victim's identity and basic motive; Session Three
reveals the killer's identity; Session Five reveals the larger conspiracy.

**Mid-Mystery Revelations**: Reveal critical information in the middle to shift focus or escalate
stakes. Example: Players discover the killer's identity mid-arc but learn they are a pawn in a
larger conspiracy. The mystery evolves from "whodunit" to "who is behind this?"

**Late Revelations**: Reserve final revelations for climactic moments. The ultimate truth, the
mastermind's identity, or the conspiracy's goal are revealed in the final confrontation or session.

**Layered Mysteries**: Design mysteries with layers. Each revelation answers one question and raises
new ones. Example: Layer One: Who killed the merchant? Layer Two: Why? Layer Three: Who ordered it?

### How to Deliver Revelations {#how-to-deliver-revelations}

Revelations should feel earned, not arbitrary. Tie revelations to player actions and investigation
efforts.

**Methods**:

- **Discovery**: Players find physical evidence (documents, artifacts, crime scenes).
- **Interview**: NPCs provide information through conversation or interrogation.
- **Deduction**: Players connect clues and deduce conclusions. The GM confirms or complicates their
  theory.
- **Event**: Revelations occur during dramatic events (confrontations, chases, ambushes). Example:
  The mastermind reveals themselves during a climactic confrontation.

**Avoid**:

- **Unprompted Exposition**: NPCs spontaneously reveal everything without player effort.
- **Arbitrary Gating**: Withholding information without fictional justification.

GM usage:

- Pace revelations across the arc; early reveals build momentum, late reveals deliver climax
- Design layered mysteries where each revelation raises new questions
- Tie revelations to player actions; make them feel earned
- Use varied delivery methods (discovery, interview, deduction, events)
- Avoid arbitrary withholding or unprompted exposition

## Fail-Forward Mystery Design {#fail-forward-mystery-design}

Fail-forward design ensures failed checks do not stall mysteries. Players always learn something;
failures add complications, not dead ends.

### Outcome Tiers in Mysteries {#outcome-tiers-in-mysteries}

Use outcome tiers (see GM Guide Chapter 6) to structure clue delivery:

- **Full Success**: Players learn the clue clearly and without complication. They may learn
  supporting clues as well.
- **Partial Success**: Players learn the clue but with cost or complication. Examples: It takes
  longer (pressure clock advances), they attract attention (new complication), or the clue is
  incomplete (requires follow-up).
- **Failure**: Players learn the clue but with significant complication or alternative information.
  Example: They learn the clue but alert enemies, or they learn misleading information requiring
  correction later.

**Example**:

Players investigate a crime scene, searching for clues about the killer.

- **Full Success**: They find the murder weapon (core clue) and notice distinctive boot prints
  (supporting clue). Both point clearly to the killer.
- **Partial Success**: They find the murder weapon but disturb the scene, alerting the local guard.
  Now they must deal with the guard's questions (complication).
- **Failure**: They miss the murder weapon but notice boot prints leading away from the scene.
  Following them leads to a red herring (innocent bystander) but also reveals a secondary clue
  (witness saw someone fleeing).

In all cases, players learn something useful. Failures create complications but do not halt
progress.

### Never Gate Core Clues Behind Single Checks {#never-gate-core-clues-behind-single-checks}

Do not require a single successful check to find a core clue. Use the Three-Clue Rule to provide
alternate paths. If players fail to find Clue A, Clues B and C remain.

**Example**: The murder weapon (core clue) can be found by:

1. Searching the crime scene (Awareness check).
2. Interviewing a witness who saw it discarded (Influence check).
3. Checking with local blacksmiths who might recognize it (Investigation check).

If players fail the crime scene search, they can still learn about the weapon through interviews or
investigation.

### Complications Over Blockages {#complications-over-blockages}

When players fail, add complications rather than blocking progress.

**Complications**:

- Time pressure (clocks advance).
- Alerting enemies (new threats appear).
- Social costs (reputation damage, suspicion).
- Incomplete information (requires follow-up or cross-referencing).

**Example**: Players fail to pick a lock on a suspect's office. Instead of "You do not get in," the
GM says: "You get in, but it takes longer than expected. The suspect returns home early and is
climbing the stairs. You have moments to search. What do you do?"

GM usage:

- Use outcome tiers to deliver clues at all success levels
- Never gate core clues behind single checks; provide alternate paths
- Frame failures as complications, not blockages
- Advance clocks or introduce threats when players fail
- Ensure players always learn something, even on failures

## Intrigue and Social Mysteries {#intrigue-and-social-mysteries}

Social mysteries focus on intrigue, secrets, leverage, and trust. Players navigate webs of
relationships, uncover hidden motives, and manipulate social dynamics.

### Leverage and Secrets {#leverage-and-secrets}

**Leverage** is information or resources used to influence NPCs. In social mysteries, leverage is
currency. Discovering secrets grants leverage over those who hold them.

**Example**: Players discover a noble is embezzling funds. This secret is leverage: they can
blackmail the noble, trade the information to rivals, or use it to force cooperation.

**Designing Leverage**:

1. **Give NPCs Secrets**: Every major NPC has something to hide (crime, scandal, forbidden
   relationship, hidden goal).
2. **Make Secrets Discoverable**: Secrets are nodes in the investigation. Clues point to them.
3. **Let Players Use Leverage**: When players gain leverage, allow them to spend it. Leverage
   creates new options and choices.

### Social Clocks {#social-clocks}

**Social clocks** track relationship dynamics, reputation, or intrigue progress.

**Examples**:

- **Earn NPC's Trust** (progress clock): Advances when players help the NPC or share valuable
  information.
- **Suspicion Grows** (pressure clock): Advances when players act suspiciously or are caught in
  lies.
- **Scandal Spreads** (pressure clock): Advances when secrets are revealed publicly or rumors
  spread.

Social clocks make abstract social dynamics tangible and create stakes.

### Intrigue Structures {#intrigue-structures}

Structure social mysteries similarly to investigation mysteries: node-based design with NPCs as
nodes.

**NPC Nodes**:

- Each major NPC is a node containing secrets, goals, and connections.
- Players interact with NPCs to learn secrets or gain leverage.
- NPCs provide leads to other NPCs (alliances, rivalries, past relationships).

**Example Intrigue Web**:

- **NPC A** (Noble): Secretly funding rebels. Allied with NPC C. Rivals with NPC B.
- **NPC B** (Merchant): Smuggling contraband. Connected to NPC D. Seeking leverage over NPC A.
- **NPC C** (Rebel Leader): Coordinating with NPC A. Distrusts NPC D.
- **NPC D** (City Guard): Investigating NPC B. Has secrets NPC B could exploit.

Players navigate this web, gathering leverage and choosing alliances. Each interaction reveals new
connections and secrets.

GM usage:

- Give major NPCs secrets; make secrets discoverable and valuable
- Use leverage as currency in social mysteries
- Track social dynamics with clocks (trust, suspicion, reputation, scandal)
- Structure intrigue as webs of NPC nodes connected by relationships
- Let players use leverage to create new options and reshape social dynamics

## Worked Example: Node-Based Murder Mystery {#worked-example-node-based-murder-mystery}

**Mystery Premise**: A wealthy merchant, Aldric Marrow, is found dead in his study. The cause:
poisoning. The suspect pool includes his business partner, his estranged daughter, a rival merchant,
and his personal secretary. Players must uncover the killer and their motive.

### Critical Revelations {#critical-revelations}

**Revelation 1**: Aldric was poisoned with rare venom (not common poison).

**Revelation 2**: The killer had access to Aldric's private study.

**Revelation 3**: The killer is the secretary, Lenara. Motive: Aldric discovered she was embezzling
funds and threatened to report her.

### Three-Clue Rule Application {#three-clue-rule-application}

**Revelation 1** (Rare Venom):

- **Clue A**: The coroner's report identifies the venom type.
- **Clue B**: An alchemist in town recently sold this venom; records show the buyer.
- **Clue C**: A witness saw someone matching the killer's description purchasing venom.

**Revelation 2** (Access to Study):

- **Clue A**: The study door was locked; only a few people have keys.
- **Clue B**: The window was locked from inside; entry was via the door.
- **Clue C**: A servant mentions who had access to the study keys.

**Revelation 3** (Lenara is the Killer):

- **Clue A**: Financial records show embezzlement; Lenara managed the books.
- **Clue B**: A threatening letter from Aldric to Lenara found in her quarters.
- **Clue C**: A witness saw Lenara entering the study shortly before Aldric's death.

### Node Map {#node-map}

#### Node 1: Crime Scene (Aldric's Study)

- **Description**: Aldric slumped at his desk, a wine glass nearby. The room is locked from inside.
- **Core Clues**: Wine glass contains venom residue (Revelation 1, Clue A). Door and window locked
  from inside (Revelation 2, Clue B).
- **Supporting Clues**: Aldric's last journal entry mentions "dealing with a betrayal."
- **Leads**: Investigate the coroner (Node 2), talk to the household staff (Node 3), search Lenara's
  quarters (Node 5).

#### Node 2: Coroner's Report

- **Description**: The city coroner examined the body.
- **Core Clues**: Coroner identifies the venom as rare and expensive (Revelation 1, Clue A).
- **Leads**: Check local alchemists who sell rare poisons (Node 4).

#### Node 3: Household Staff Interviews

- **Description**: Servants, guards, and household members.
- **Core Clues**: A servant mentions Lenara, Aldric's business partner, and his daughter all had
  keys to the study (Revelation 2, Clue C).
- **Supporting Clues**: A maid mentions Lenara seemed nervous recently. A guard saw Lenara entering
  the study shortly before Aldric's body was discovered (Revelation 3, Clue C).
- **Leads**: Investigate Lenara (Node 5), talk to the business partner (Node 6), talk to the
  daughter (Node 7).

#### Node 4: Alchemist Shop

- **Description**: A shady alchemist who sells rare ingredients and poisons.
- **Core Clues**: Records show a customer matching Lenara's description bought the venom a week ago
  (Revelation 1, Clue B).
- **Supporting Clues**: The alchemist remembers the buyer seemed anxious and paid in cash.
- **Leads**: Investigate Lenara (Node 5).

#### Node 5: Lenara's Quarters

- **Description**: Lenara's private rooms in Aldric's estate.
- **Core Clues**: Financial ledgers hidden in her room show embezzlement (Revelation 3, Clue A). A
  threatening letter from Aldric: "I know what you have done. We will discuss this tomorrow. If you
  do not confess, I will report you" (Revelation 3, Clue B).
- **Supporting Clues**: A vial (empty) matching the venom description.
- **Leads**: Confront Lenara (Node 8).

#### Node 6: Business Partner Interview

- **Description**: Aldric's business partner, a rival merchant named Torian.
- **Red Herring**: Torian has no alibi and benefits from Aldric's death (inherits business share).
  Investigation reveals Torian was meeting with investors at the time of death (alibi confirmed).
  Torian is not the killer but becomes a future ally or complication.
- **Supporting Clues**: Torian mentions Aldric was worried about financial irregularities recently.
- **Leads**: Check financial records (leads to Node 5).

#### Node 7: Daughter Interview

- **Description**: Aldric's estranged daughter, Mira. She and Aldric argued frequently.
- **Red Herring**: Mira had motive (inheritance) and access (has a key). Investigation reveals she
  was out of town during the murder (confirmed by travel records and witnesses).
- **Supporting Clues**: Mira mentions Lenara was "too loyal, almost obsessive" about Aldric's
  finances.
- **Leads**: Investigate Lenara (Node 5).

#### Node 8: Confrontation with Lenara

- **Description**: Players confront Lenara with evidence.
- **Outcome**: Lenara confesses or attempts to flee/fight, depending on evidence presented and
  player approach. If overwhelming evidence, she confesses: she embezzled funds to pay personal
  debts, Aldric discovered it, and she panicked and poisoned him.
- **Resolution**: Players decide Lenara's fate: turn her over to authorities, blackmail her for
  information, or let her escape in exchange for leverage.

### Investigation Flow Examples {#investigation-flow-examples}

#### Path 1: Crime Scene → Coroner → Alchemist → Lenara's Quarters → Confrontation

Players investigate the crime scene, learn about the venom, trace it to the alchemist, discover
Lenara bought it, search her quarters, find evidence of embezzlement and the threatening letter,
confront her. Revelations discovered in order.

#### Path 2: Staff Interviews → Lenara's Quarters → Coroner → Confrontation

Players talk to staff first, learn Lenara acted suspiciously, search her quarters, find the ledgers
and letter, confirm venom via coroner, confront her. Revelations discovered out of order but lead to
same conclusion.

#### Path 3: Business Partner → Daughter → Staff → Lenara's Quarters → Confrontation

Players investigate red herrings first (Torian and Mira), rule them out, talk to staff, learn about
Lenara, investigate her, confront her. Red herrings resolved before discovering the real killer.

All paths lead to Lenara. The Three-Clue Rule ensures players find enough evidence regardless of
path. Node structure supports non-linear exploration.

### GM Prep and Play {#gm-prep-and-play}

**Prep**:

1. Map nodes visually (draw diagram showing connections).
2. Write clues for each node on index cards or digital notes.
3. Track which nodes players explore and which clues they discover.
4. Prepare Lenara's stats and tactics for potential confrontation or escape.

**During Play**:

1. Let players choose investigation paths; do not railroad.
2. Deliver clues based on player actions and checks (use outcome tiers).
3. Advance a "Suspicion Grows" clock if players are careless or Lenara realizes she is being
   investigated. When the clock fills, Lenara flees or prepares defenses.
4. Use red herrings (Torian, Mira) to add complexity but resolve them relatively quickly.
5. Build toward the confrontation; make it climactic and allow player choice in resolution.

**Resolution**:

Players confront Lenara with evidence. Possible outcomes:

- Lenara confesses and is arrested. Players are rewarded by Torian (new business partner) or Mira
  (grateful daughter).
- Lenara flees; players pursue (chase scene or future complication).
- Lenara attacks; players subdue her (combat encounter).
- Players strike a deal with Lenara for information or future leverage (intrigue path).
