## How Solo Adapts the Loop {#how-solo-adapts-the-loop}

You still use the table loop (Ask → Declare → Judge → Resolve → Update → Ask),
but you ask an oracle instead of a GM when you need outside input. Keep a short
journal: write questions, answers, and what changed. Prefer visible state (tags,
conditions, clocks) over secret notes.

Principles

- Ask concrete questions (“Does the guard leave?”)
- Pick odds before rolling (Very Unlikely → Very Likely)
- Keep results visible: update clocks and note tags/conditions

## Solo Scene Procedure {#solo-scene-procedure}

1) Frame: set objective, name 1–2 tags, state stakes
2) Ask: when fiction is unclear, ask the oracle; otherwise proceed
3) Check: pick tool and DC from fiction; pre‑state Full/Partial/Fail
4) Resolve: roll; interpret tier; update state (clocks/tags/conditions)
5) Log: write a brief note of what changed and any new hooks
6) Ask again: choose your next action based on the new state

## Oracles & Prompts {#oracles--prompts}

Yes/No Oracle (choose odds, then roll 4d6)

- Very Unlikely: yes on 20+
- Unlikely: yes on 18+
- 50/50: yes on 14+
- Likely: yes on 10+
- Very Likely: yes on 8+

**Note**: This uses the standard 4d6 roll (average 14) to determine yes/no outcomes. The thresholds create roughly the odds you'd expect for each category.

Detail Prompts (roll d6 twice or choose)

- Theme: Debt • Trust • Escape • Intrigue • Mercy • Betrayal
- Texture: Crowded • Quiet • Rain • Firelight • Gritty • Ornate

GM usage (solo)

- If a roll suggests trouble, introduce a pressure clock or tag
- If you need a nudge, pick a prompt and tie it to your current tags/clocks

## Clocks, Tags, Conditions {#clocks-tags-conditions}

Use the same levers as at the table. Pair progress/pressure clocks (sizes 4/6/8)
to pace scenes. Only tick complication clocks on Partial when you’ve pre‑stated
them for the scene or beat.

Patterns

- Full: tick progress; consider clearing a minor tag on crit
- Partial: tick pre‑stated pressure; add a tag or minor condition
- Fail: no progress; escalate pressure; reveal a complication

## Safety & Scope {#safety--scope}

Timebox scenes (20–30 minutes). When you feel drift, restate stakes and theme,
or end the scene on the next meaningful change. Use lines/veils for tone; avoid
dwelling on unwanted content—summarize and move on.

## Worked Mini Example {#worked-mini-example}

Setup: You search the Sunken Cloister for a reliquary before the tide.

Tags: Dim, Waist‑Deep Water. Clocks: Progress — Reliquary (6); Pressure — Tide
(6).

Frame: “Full: find a safe route and advance 2; Partial: advance 1 and Tide 1;
Fail: Tide +2 and a minor condition.”

Ask: Is there a safe ledge route? (50/50 → roll 12: Yes)

Check: Survey (DC 16, Tough) to trace carvings under the waterline.

Resolve:

- Full: Tick Reliquary 2; note a carved fish path
- Partial: Tick Reliquary 1 and Tide 1; Tag: Off‑Route
- Fail: No progress; Tide +2; Condition: Soaked or Snagged Strap

Log: “Carved fish marks; progress 1; Tide 1; Off‑Route applied.” Next, ask if a
side chamber offers a shortcut (Unlikely).
