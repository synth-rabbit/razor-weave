## NPC Roles & Goals {#npc-roles--goals}

- Ally: provides aid, asks for help, changes with favors
- Patron: resources and pressure; sets objectives
- Foil: competes for the same goals; raises stakes without direct violence
- Antagonist: actively opposes; pressures clocks; punishes stalling

## Fast NPC Template {#fast-npc-template}

- Name, Role, Goal, Leverage
- Hooks (easy/risky):
  - Easy: the favor they’ll do if it costs little
  - Risky: the favor they’ll do if you pay a price
- Weakness: what flips them (greed, pride, duty)
- Tag/Condition: a lever they bring (Guarded, Overworked)
- GM Usage: how they move scenes forward

Example: Clerk Sessa (Patron‑adjacent)

- Hooks: Easy — stamp routine papers off‑hours; Risky — expedite a late permit
- Weakness: pride in being fair; don’t insult their duty
- Tag: Overworked (Crowded raises DCs unless space is controlled)

## Running NPCs {#running-npcs}

- State what they want right now; update when facts change
- Use Hooks to turn talk into action; offer price for risky favors
- On Partial, change what they watch or demand (Scrutiny +1; Flagged Request)

## Maintenance {#maintenance}

- Session log: note goal shifts, new leverage, and changed tags
- Flags: record player promises and debts
- Evolution: promote/demote roles as the campaign shifts
