## Character Arc Types {#character-arc-types}

Character arcs describe how characters change (or resist change) over the course of a story.
Understanding arc types helps you create situations that support character development without
scripting player choices.

**Growth Arc**: The character overcomes a flaw, learns a lesson, or develops a new capability.
Growth arcs move from weakness to strength, ignorance to understanding, or isolation to connection.
Example: A cynical mercenary learns to trust their companions.

**Fall Arc**: The character succumbs to temptation, loses something vital, or becomes the thing they
opposed. Fall arcs create tragedy and explore what happens when characters compromise core values.
Example: A noble knight becomes ruthless in pursuit of justice.

**Flat Arc**: The character does not change internally; instead, they change the world around them
by maintaining their principles. Flat arcs are heroic and aspirational; the character is already who
they need to be. Example: A loyal guardian protects their charge despite overwhelming pressure to
abandon them.

**Ensemble Arc**: Multiple characters share an arc, changing together through shared experiences.
Ensemble arcs emphasize group dynamics and collective growth. Example: A fractured party learns to
work as a cohesive unit.

Not every character needs a defined arc, and arcs can shift mid-campaign based on player choices.
Some players prefer reactive characters who respond to events without deep internal change. Other
players want transformative arcs with clear emotional beats. Check with players at Session Zero to
gauge their interest in character arcs.

## Flags, Bonds, and Hooks {#flags-bonds-and-hooks}

Flags, bonds, and hooks are player-authored tools that invite you to engage character backstory and
goals. They give you permission to create scenes that test, complicate, or advance character
concerns.

**Flags**: Explicit statements of what a player wants to explore. Flags can be thematic ("I want
scenes where my loyalty to the crown is tested"), mechanical ("I want to use my disguise abilities
in social infiltration"), or emotional ("I want moments where my character confronts their fear of
failure"). Collect flags at Session Zero and revisit them every few sessions.

**Bonds**: Relationships or obligations that tie characters to NPCs, factions, or places. Bonds
create recurring story hooks and give you levers for complicating choices. Example: A bond to a
mentor NPC lets you create scenes where the mentor asks for help or their safety is threatened.
Bonds are mechanical in some systems (see Player Guide Chapter 5) and purely narrative in others.

**Hooks**: Unresolved backstory elements or character mysteries that players signal they want
addressed. Hooks are questions without answers: Who killed my family? Why was I exiled? What is the
artifact I carry? Hooks give you permission to introduce revelations, complications, or choices
related to those questions.

Use flags, bonds, and hooks as session prep tools. Choose one or two per session to engage directly,
and sprinkle references to others in narration or NPC dialogue. This ensures every player feels seen
without overwhelming any single session with character focus.

GM usage:

- At Session Zero, collect 2-3 flags or hooks per player
- Track bonds in your campaign notes; update when bonds form or break
- Choose one flag or hook to spotlight per session
- Revisit flags every 3-4 sessions to see if player interests have shifted

## Authored Moments vs Emergent Narrative {#authored-moments-vs-emergent-narrative}

Balancing authored moments (scenes you design to engage character arcs) with emergent narrative
(arcs that arise from player choices) is central to supporting character development without
railroading.

**Authored Moments**: Pre-designed scenes or encounters that engage a character's flag, bond, or
hook. Example: You know a player wants their character to confront their estranged sibling, so you
introduce the sibling as an NPC in a planned scene. Authored moments give you control over pacing
and setup, ensuring key beats happen.

**Emergent Narrative**: Arcs that develop organically from player choices and table dynamics.
Example: A player repeatedly chooses to protect innocents even when tactically disadvantageous, so
you build that pattern into a narrative arc by introducing NPCs who recognize and test that heroism.
Emergent narrative feels organic and player-driven but requires attentiveness and improvisation.

Both approaches are valid and complementary. Use authored moments for major character beats
(confronting a nemesis, choosing between two loyalties) and emergent narrative for developing
patterns and unexpected turns.

The key is consent and flexibility. Authored moments work when you check with players beforehand ("I
am thinking of introducing your sibling as an NPC next session. Is that interesting to you?").
Emergent narrative works when you follow player cues without forcing outcomes ("I notice you keep
protecting innocents; I will create situations that test that value").

Avoid scripting outcomes. Authored moments should present situations, not dictate results. If you
introduce a sibling NPC, do not script reconciliation or conflict; let the player's choices
determine the outcome.

GM usage:

- Ask players at Session Zero if they want authored character moments or prefer emergent arcs
- For authored moments, check with players before introducing major backstory NPCs or revelations
- For emergent narrative, take notes on repeated player choices and build on them
- Never script outcomes; design situations and let players choose

## Arc Milestones and Progression Triggers {#arc-milestones-and-progression-triggers}

Character arcs often align with mechanical progression (see Player Guide Chapter 6), but they can
also operate independently as narrative milestones.

**Narrative Milestones**: Key moments that mark character development. Examples: "Confront your
fear," "Reconcile with an estranged ally," "Choose between two loyalties," "Achieve a long-term
goal." Narrative milestones do not grant mechanical benefits; they provide emotional payoff and
story closure.

**Mechanical Progression Triggers**: Moments when character growth translates into new abilities,
tags, or mechanical advancement. Example: After a character overcomes their fear in a climactic
scene, they gain a new tag (*Fearless*) or remove a limiting condition (*Haunted by Doubt*).

Align narrative and mechanical milestones when possible. A character who completes a growth arc by
learning to trust might gain a new bond or lose a negative tag at the same moment. This reinforces
the connection between story and mechanics.

Not all milestones need mechanical rewards, and not all mechanical progression needs narrative
justification. Some players care deeply about aligning story and mechanics; others prefer to keep
them separate. Check player preferences and adjust accordingly.

GM usage:

- Identify 2-3 narrative milestones per character arc
- Offer mechanical progression triggers when milestones align with arc beats
- Let players define their own milestones if they prefer emergent arcs
- Celebrate milestones with in-fiction recognition (NPC reactions, world changes)

## Ensemble Balancing {#ensemble-balancing}

Balancing spotlight across multiple characters is essential for ensemble play. Every player should
feel their character matters, even when a specific session focuses on another character's arc.

**Spotlight Rotation**: Plan sessions to rotate spotlight across characters. Session 1 focuses on
Character A's flag; Session 2 engages Character B's bond; Session 3 is ensemble-focused with no
single character spotlight. This ensures fairness without making any session feel fragmented.

**Shared Arcs**: Create arcs where multiple characters have stakes or connections. Example: The
party investigates a conspiracy; each character has a personal reason to care (one seeks a missing
sibling, another wants to clear their name, a third owes a debt to a victim). Shared arcs let you
engage multiple characters simultaneously.

**Supporting Roles**: When a session spotlights one character, give other characters supporting
roles that matter. Example: Session 3 focuses on Character A confronting their mentor. Character B
provides tactical support, Character C negotiates with a rival faction to create an opening, and
Character D gathers intelligence. Everyone contributes even when the emotional focus is on Character
A.

**Ensemble Beats**: Include ensemble beats in every session: moments where the group dynamic matters
more than individual characters. Examples: Shared victories, group decisions, moments of collective
tension or relief. Ensemble beats reinforce group cohesion and give quieter players chances to
contribute.

Track spotlight over time. If a character has not been spotlighted in 3-4 sessions, prioritize their
flag or bond in the next session. If a player seems disengaged, check in privately to see if they
feel overlooked or if their interests have shifted.

GM usage:

- Track spotlight in session notes; aim for every character to be spotlighted every 3-4 sessions
- Design shared arcs where multiple characters have personal stakes
- Give supporting roles to non-spotlighted characters
- Include at least one ensemble beat per session

## Worked Example: Growth Arc Across Six Sessions {#worked-example-growth-arc-across-six-sessions}

**Character**: Kael, a former soldier haunted by a battlefield failure that cost lives. Kael's flaw:
avoids leadership roles and hesitates to make hard tactical calls.

**Arc Goal**: Kael learns to trust their judgment and accepts leadership responsibility despite past
failure.

**Session 1: Introduction** (Setup)

The party faces a tactical challenge (ambush or complex combat). Another character naturally takes
the lead, but their plan is flawed. Kael notices the flaw but stays silent, deferring to the other
character. The plan partially succeeds but with avoidable costs. After the scene, an NPC or another
player asks why Kael did not speak up. This establishes Kael's flaw narratively and mechanically
(Kael has a *Haunted by Failure* condition that imposes disadvantage on Leadership checks).

**Session 2: First Test** (Development)

The party is hired to escort a caravan through dangerous terrain. The employer assumes Kael, as the
experienced soldier, will lead the escort. Kael is uncomfortable but agrees. During the journey,
bandits attack. Kael must make a tactical call under pressure: fight or retreat to defensible
ground. Player chooses to retreat (a sound call). The choice succeeds and the caravan is saved, but
Kael second-guesses the decision afterward, wondering if fighting would have been bolder.

**Session 3: Complication** (Development)

An NPC from Kael's military past appears, someone who survived the battlefield failure. The NPC is
bitter and blames Kael for the deaths. This scene tests Kael emotionally: does Kael accept the
blame, deflect it, or try to reconcile? Player chooses to accept responsibility and apologize, but
the NPC does not forgive. This reinforces Kael's internal conflict and deepens the arc.

**Session 4: Support** (Development)

The party faces a non-combat challenge requiring tactical planning (heist, negotiation, or
exploration). Another character explicitly asks Kael to lead the planning. Kael makes a plan, and
the party executes it. The plan succeeds (full or partial), and party members vocally appreciate
Kael's leadership. This session provides positive reinforcement and begins shifting Kael's
self-perception.

**Session 5: Climactic Test** (Climax)

The party faces a major conflict where Kael must make a high-stakes leadership call: sacrifice a
tactical advantage to save innocents, or prioritize mission success. The choice echoes Kael's
original failure. Player chooses to save the innocents, accepting the tactical cost. The mission
succeeds but barely, and lives are saved. After the scene, the NPC from Session 3 reappears,
witnessing Kael's choice. The NPC acknowledges Kael has changed and offers forgiveness.

**Session 6: Resolution** (Resolution)

Kael's *Haunted by Failure* condition is removed and replaced with a new tag: *Tested Leader*. The
party celebrates their victory, and an NPC or faction offers Kael a formal leadership role (command
of a militia, leadership of the party, or a position of responsibility). Player chooses whether to
accept. The arc concludes with Kael having proven their growth, and the player decides how that
growth manifests going forward.

**Arc Structure**: Each session built on the previous one, testing Kael's flaw in different contexts
(tactical, emotional, ethical). The arc allowed player choice at every stage (Kael could have
rejected leadership, deflected blame, or chosen differently in Session 5). Authored moments (NPC
from the past, climactic choice) were balanced with emergent development (party members' organic
support). The arc aligned narrative growth with mechanical progression (*Haunted by Failure*
removed, *Tested Leader* gained).
