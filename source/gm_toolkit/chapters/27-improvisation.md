## Improvisation Foundations {#improvisation-foundations}

Improvisation is the art of building narrative collaboratively in the moment. No amount of
preparation eliminates improvisation; players will always surprise you. Embracing improvisation
makes your game flexible, responsive, and alive.

Good improvisation is not making things up randomly. It is building on established fiction,
listening to player input, and using frameworks to guide choices. Improvisation requires
preparation: not rigid plans, but flexible tools and prompts.

### Yes-And {#yes-and}

**Yes-And** is the foundational improvisation technique. When a player proposes something, your
default response is to accept it (Yes) and build on it (And).

**Yes**: Accept the player's contribution as true within the fiction. If a player says, "I search
the desk for secret compartments," they are proposing that secret compartments might exist. Yes
means acknowledging the possibility.

**And**: Build on the contribution. Add complexity, consequence, or connection. "Yes, you find a
secret compartment, and inside is a coded letter. The handwriting matches the mayor's."

**When to Say No**: Yes-And is not absolute. Say No when the contribution breaks established
fiction, contradicts core premises, or undermines safety (crosses lines or veils). When you say No,
offer an alternative: "No, the castle is not made of glass (that contradicts the medieval setting),
but it could have stained glass windows famous throughout the land."

**Practicing Yes-And**: Train yourself to default to acceptance. Before saying No, ask: Does this
break anything essential? If not, say Yes-And. Players will surprise you with brilliant ideas if you
let them.

### Reframe {#reframe}

**Reframing** is adjusting a player contribution to fit the fiction without rejecting it outright.

**Example**: Player: "I convince the guard to let us in." GM: "He is loyal and does not budge, but
he mentions that the side gate is less guarded. You could reframe your approach or try a different
angle."

Reframing honors player intent while steering toward fictional consistency. It is a softer tool than
No.

### Build on Player Input {#build-on-player-input}

Players constantly provide input: through questions, speculation, character actions, and table talk.
Mine this input for improvisational gold.

**Listen for Questions**: Player questions reveal interest. If a player asks, "Is the innkeeper
acting nervous?" they are interested in the innkeeper. Make the innkeeper significant, even if you
had not planned it.

**Listen for Speculation**: When players speculate about the plot, they are offering ideas. If a
player says, "What if the mayor is secretly funding the bandits?" and it does not contradict your
prep, consider adopting it. Players feel brilliant when their speculations come true.

**Listen for Actions**: Player actions reveal priorities. If players spend time investigating the
docks despite your planned noble intrigue plot, the docks matter to them. Adjust accordingly.

GM usage:

- Default to Yes-And when players contribute ideas
- Reframe contributions that do not fit, rather than rejecting outright
- Listen actively to player questions, speculation, and actions
- Use player input to guide improvisation
- Say No only when necessary; offer alternatives when you do

## Reincorporation and Callbacks {#reincorporation-and-callbacks}

**Reincorporation** is bringing back earlier details in new contexts. **Callbacks** are explicit
references to past events. Both techniques create cohesion and reward player attention.

### Reincorporation {#reincorporation}

Reincorporation makes seemingly minor details significant. A throwaway NPC mentioned in Session One
becomes crucial in Session Three. A random clue becomes the key to the mystery. Reincorporation
creates the feeling of a planned, interconnected world, even when improvised.

**How to Reincorporate**:

1. **Take Notes**: During sessions, jot down details players notice or ask about. These are seeds
   for reincorporation.
2. **Review Between Sessions**: Before the next session, review notes and identify details to
   reincorporate.
3. **Elevate Minor Details**: Take a minor detail and give it new significance. The bartender
   mentioned once becomes an informant. The strange symbol noticed in Session One appears again, now
   with meaning.

**Example**: Session One: Players pass through a market and notice a merchant selling unusual
charms. The GM notes this. Session Three: Players need information about a magical artifact. The GM
reincorporates: "You remember the merchant in the market who sold unusual charms. Perhaps they know
something about magical artifacts."

### Callbacks {#callbacks}

Callbacks are explicit references to past events, reinforcing continuity and player impact.

**Types of Callbacks**:

- **Character Callbacks**: NPCs remember past interactions. "You helped my village. I will not
  forget that."
- **Location Callbacks**: Returning to locations shows change. "The inn you saved from the fire has
  been rebuilt. The owner greets you warmly."
- **Consequence Callbacks**: Past choices have present effects. "The bandit you spared has joined
  the city guard. He recognizes you and nods in thanks."

**How to Create Callbacks**:

1. **Track Player Choices**: Note decisions with potential long-term consequences.
2. **Show Change**: When players return to a location or meet an NPC affected by past actions, show
   how things have changed.
3. **Reward or Complicate**: Callbacks can reward (allies remember kindness) or complicate (enemies
   remember slights).

GM usage:

- Take detailed session notes; minor details become reincorporation seeds
- Review notes between sessions to identify reincorporation opportunities
- Elevate minor details by giving them new significance
- Use callbacks to show player impact and reinforce continuity
- Balance rewarding callbacks and complicating callbacks

## Emergent Narrative from Mechanics {#emergent-narrative-from-mechanics}

Mechanics generate narrative. Dice results, conditions, clocks, and tags create prompts for
improvisation. Rather than fighting mechanical outcomes, use them to drive story.

### Failures as Prompts {#failures-as-prompts}

Failed checks are not dead ends; they are complications and new directions. When a player fails,
ask: What interesting consequence moves the story forward?

**Example**: A player fails to pick a lock. Instead of "You do not open it," the GM says: "You open
it, but it takes too long. You hear footsteps approaching. What do you do?"

Failures create urgency, introduce new problems, or reveal information. Use the outcome tiers (see
GM Guide Chapter 6): Fail means complication, not blockage.

### Partials as Opportunities {#partials-as-opportunities}

Partial successes offer built-in improvisation: success with cost or complication. Use partials to
introduce interesting choices or narrative twists.

**Example**: A player partially succeeds at persuading a merchant. GM: "He agrees to provide the
supplies, but he wants a favor in return: deliver a package to someone in the next town. He will not
say what is inside."

Partials add texture and consequence. They create new levers for future scenes.

### Conditions as Story Prompts {#conditions-as-story-prompts}

Conditions (Injured, Exhausted, Suspicious, etc.) are narrative hooks. When a player gains a
condition, describe it fictionally and use it to shape scenes.

**Example**: A character gains the Exhausted condition. GM: "You are exhausted. Your hands shake as
you try to prepare the ritual. How does this exhaustion manifest? What are you thinking about?"

Conditions invite player collaboration in describing their character's state. They create
opportunities for character moments.

### Clocks as Narrative Drivers {#clocks-as-narrative-drivers}

When clocks advance, describe the change in the fiction. Clocks create visible momentum and prompt
improvisation.

**Example**: The "Villain's Ritual" pressure clock advances. GM: "As you rest, you feel a tremor.
The sky darkens briefly. Whatever the cultists are doing, it is progressing. Locals are starting to
panic."

Advancing clocks force decisions and create urgency. They turn abstract threats into immediate
concerns.

GM usage:

- Use failures to introduce complications or urgency, not blockage
- Frame partials as successes with interesting costs or choices
- Treat conditions as narrative prompts; describe them fictionally
- When clocks advance, describe the change in the world
- Let mechanics drive narrative rather than resisting mechanical outcomes

## Converting Player Ideas to Mechanics {#converting-player-ideas-to-mechanics}

Players propose actions or ideas that do not map neatly to existing mechanics. Improvise mechanics
on the fly to support player creativity.

### Creating On-the-Fly Tags {#creating-on-the-fly-tags}

When a player describes a creative action, create a tag to represent it.

**Example**: Player: "I spend the evening studying the guard patrol routes." GM: "Great. Roll
Awareness. Success: You create the tag 'Studied the Routes,' which you can invoke later for
advantage during infiltration."

On-the-fly tags reward preparation and clever thinking. They create setup-payoff moments.

### Improvising Clocks {#improvising-clocks}

When a player pursues a long-term goal not covered by existing clocks, create one.

**Example**: Player: "I want to earn the blacksmith's trust so he will share information about the
strange metal." GM: "Good plan. I am creating a 'Earn Blacksmith's Trust' progress clock with 4
segments. Each time you help him or share something valuable, we will advance it."

Clocks make abstract goals tangible and track progress.

### Generating NPCs on the Spot {#generating-npcs-on-the-spot}

When players ask about an NPC you have not prepared, improvise.

**Quick NPC Framework**:

1. **Name**: Use a name generator or pick something simple.
2. **Trait**: One defining trait (nervous, greedy, kind, suspicious).
3. **Want**: What does this NPC want right now?
4. **Connection**: How does this NPC connect to the larger situation?

**Example**: Player: "Is there anyone in the tavern who looks like they know about the ruins?" GM
(improvising): "Yes, an old woman sits in the corner. She is called Mara. She is wary but not
hostile. She wants to warn people away from the ruins, but she also wants to know why you are
interested. She lost her son in the ruins twenty years ago."

Quick NPCs can be detailed later. Get them into play and refine as needed.

### Modular Scenes and Encounters {#modular-scenes-and-encounters}

Prepare modular content: scenes, NPCs, or encounters not tied to specific locations or times. When
players take unexpected directions, deploy modular content.

**Example**: You prepared a market encounter where players meet an informant. Players skip the
market. The informant can appear at the tavern instead. Modular content is flexible.

GM usage:

- Create tags on the fly to reward creative player actions
- Improvise clocks for player-initiated goals
- Use quick NPC frameworks to generate NPCs in the moment
- Prepare modular scenes and encounters deployable anywhere
- Record improvised content (tags, clocks, NPCs) in notes for consistency

## Handling Unexpected Directions {#handling-unexpected-directions}

Players will take unexpected directions. They will ignore hooks, pursue tangents, or invent new
goals. Handling unexpected directions gracefully is essential to improvisation.

### Pivot Techniques {#pivot-techniques}

When players take an unexpected direction, pivot your prep rather than railroading them back.

**Technique 1: Relocate Prep**: Move prepared content to the new location. If players go to the
docks instead of the noble's estate, the clue you placed at the estate appears at the docks instead.

**Technique 2: Adjust NPCs**: Change which NPC delivers information or provides hooks. If players
befriend the bartender instead of the guard captain, the bartender becomes the information source.

**Technique 3: Reframe Stakes**: If players ignore the main plot, make the main plot come to them.
The cultists they ignored attack the tavern. The noble they avoided sends an assassin. Consequences
create re-engagement.

### Ask Questions {#ask-questions}

When players take an unexpected direction, ask questions to understand their goals.

**Examples**:

- "What are you hoping to find by investigating the docks?"
- "Why is earning the merchant's trust important to you?"
- "What is your character's goal here?"

Player answers reveal intent. Once you understand intent, you can build content that satisfies it.

### Offer Choices {#offer-choices}

When the path forward is unclear, offer choices to players.

**Example**: GM: "You have learned the cult meets in either the warehouse district or the old
temple. Time is short. Where do you go?"

Offering choices restores player agency and allows the GM to focus prep on chosen paths.

### Retcon Protocols {#retcon-protocols}

Sometimes improvisation creates contradictions or mistakes. Retconning (retroactively changing
established facts) is acceptable if done carefully.

**When to Retcon**:

- When an improvised detail contradicts core fiction or themes
- When a mistake breaks internal consistency
- When the table agrees a change improves the story

**How to Retcon**:

1. Acknowledge the issue: "I realize I said the vault was locked, but I forgot the rogue has the
   key. Let us rewind."
2. Propose the retcon: "Instead of locked, let us say it is trapped. Does that work?"
3. Confirm with the table: "Everyone okay with that adjustment?"

Retcons are tools, not failures. Use them to maintain consistency, not to take back player
victories.

GM usage:

- Pivot prep rather than railroading players back to planned content
- Relocate prepared scenes, adjust NPCs, or reframe stakes to fit new directions
- Ask players questions to understand unexpected actions and goals
- Offer choices when paths are unclear
- Use retcons carefully to maintain consistency; confirm with the table

## Preparation for Improvisation {#preparation-for-improvisation}

Improvisation requires preparation. The paradox of improvisation: the more you prepare, the easier
it is to improvise. Prepare flexible tools, not rigid scripts.

### Flexible Prep {#flexible-prep}

Flexible prep includes:

- **NPCs Not Tied to Locations**: Create NPCs with goals and personalities, but do not lock them to
  specific places. They can appear wherever players go.
- **Modular Encounters**: Prepare encounters (social, combat, exploration) deployable in multiple
  contexts.
- **Clue Lists**: Prepare clues for mysteries, but do not tie them to specific locations. Deploy
  them wherever players investigate.
- **Situation, Not Plot**: Prepare situations (conflicts, threats, opportunities) rather than plots.
  Situations react to player actions; plots railroad.

**Example**: Instead of "Players infiltrate the estate, find the clue in the study, and confront the
noble," prepare: "The noble is hiding evidence of their involvement. The evidence could be in the
estate, with an ally, or in a safe deposit. Players choose how to investigate."

### NPC Banks {#npc-banks}

Create an NPC bank: a list of 5-10 NPCs with names, traits, and wants. When you need an NPC, pull
from the bank.

**NPC Bank Template**:

- **Name**: [Name]
- **Trait**: [One defining trait]
- **Want**: [What they want]
- **Connection**: [How they connect to the setting or plot]

**Example NPC Bank Entry**:

- **Name**: Joran the Fence
- **Trait**: Greedy but reliable
- **Want**: Wants to expand his smuggling operation
- **Connection**: Has contacts in the city guard; can provide information or illegal goods

### Location Banks {#location-banks}

Create a location bank: a list of interesting locations with brief descriptions. When players go
somewhere unexpected, pull from the bank.

**Location Bank Template**:

- **Name**: [Location name]
- **Description**: [One-sentence description]
- **Notable Feature**: [One interesting detail]
- **Potential Hook**: [How this location could matter]

**Example Location Bank Entry**:

- **Name**: The Drowned Pier
- **Description**: An abandoned pier, half-collapsed into the bay
- **Notable Feature**: Local rumor says smugglers use it at night
- **Potential Hook**: Could contain smuggled goods, a hidden meeting place, or clues about missing
  cargo

### Scenario Frameworks {#scenario-frameworks}

Use frameworks to structure improvisation. Frameworks provide guardrails without scripting outcomes.

**Mystery Framework**: Three-clue rule (see Chapter 10). Players need three paths to each key
revelation. Prepare clues, not solutions. Let players connect dots.

**Social Framework**: Goals, leverage, costs (see Chapter 11). Each NPC has a goal, leverage to
offer or withhold, and costs they will pay. Improvise dialogue but stick to framework.

**Combat Framework**: Environment, enemies, objectives (see GM Guide Chapter 11). Prepare set pieces
with interesting terrain and clear objectives. Improvise tactics based on player actions.

GM usage:

- Prepare flexible, modular content not tied to specific sequences
- Create NPC and location banks for quick deployment
- Use frameworks (mystery, social, combat) to structure improvisation
- Prepare situations and stakes, not rigid plots
- Review and refine banks and frameworks between sessions

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: Player Invents an NPC {#example-1-player-invents-an-npc}

**Setup**: The party is investigating disappearances in a city. They decide to visit the docks to
gather information. The GM has not prepared dock NPCs.

**Player Action**: "I approach a dockworker and ask if they have seen anything strange. Maybe
someone who works here regularly would know?"

**Improvisation in Action**:

1. **Yes-And**: The GM accepts the proposal. "Yes, there is a dockworker who has been here for
   years. Let me create them."

2. **Quick NPC Creation**:
   - **Name**: The GM quickly picks "Tam."
   - **Trait**: Nervous and observant (fits the mystery tone).
   - **Want**: Tam wants to avoid trouble but is worried about the disappearances.
   - **Connection**: Tam saw something but is afraid to speak openly.

3. **Introduce the NPC**: GM: "You see Tam, a dockworker unloading crates. He is nervous, glancing
   around frequently. When you approach, he tenses but does not run."

4. **Build on Player Input**: The player rolls Influence (social skill). Partial success. GM: "Tam
   is reluctant but talks. He says he saw a ship unload strange cargo late at night three days ago.
   Hooded figures, no insignia. He did not ask questions; people who ask questions around here
   disappear. He will say no more unless you promise to protect him."

5. **Create a Hook**: Tam becomes a recurring NPC. If players promise protection, Tam provides more
   information later. If players ignore him, Tam might disappear next, escalating stakes.

**Outcome**: The GM improvised an NPC in the moment using a quick framework. The NPC feels real and
connected to the plot. The player's idea (talking to a dockworker) created a new lead and potential
ally. The improvisation honors player agency and moves the story forward.

### Example 2: Failed Check Creates New Direction {#example-2-failed-check-creates-new-direction}

**Setup**: The party is infiltrating a mansion to steal a document. The rogue attempts to pick the
lock on the study door.

**Player Action**: The player rolls to pick the lock. Result: Fail.

**Improvisation in Action**:

1. **Failure as Complication**: The GM does not say "You fail to pick the lock, and nothing
   happens." Instead: "The lock is more complex than expected. You struggle with it, and it takes
   longer than planned. You hear footsteps approaching down the hall. Someone is coming. What do you
   do?"

2. **Create Urgency**: The failed check introduces a complication: time pressure. The party must
   decide quickly: hide, bluff, fight, or flee.

3. **Build on Player Response**: The players decide to hide in a side room. They roll Stealth.
   Partial success. GM: "You hide, but one of you knocks over a vase. It clatters. The approaching
   guard pauses. 'Who is there?' he calls out. He is cautious but investigating."

4. **Emergent Narrative**: The guard was not part of the original plan. The failed lock pick created
   him. Now the players must deal with the guard: distract him, ambush him, talk their way out, or
   wait for him to leave. The story branches in an unplanned but interesting direction.

5. **Advance a Clock**: The GM advances the "Mansion Security Alert" pressure clock. If it fills,
   the entire mansion goes on lockdown. The failure has consequences beyond the immediate scene.

**Outcome**: The failed check created new tension and narrative branches. The GM used the failure to
introduce a complication (guard approaching) and long-term consequence (clock advancement). The
story is now more dynamic and unpredictable. The players must improvise solutions, and the GM
improvises responses.

### Example 3: Players Ignore the Hook {#example-3-players-ignore-the-hook}

**Setup**: The GM prepared a session where a mysterious stranger offers the party a job to retrieve
an artifact from dangerous ruins. The GM expects players to accept and go to the ruins.

**Player Action**: The party listens to the stranger's offer and declines. They are more interested
in investigating recent disappearances in town, a side plot the GM mentioned in passing.

**Improvisation in Action**:

1. **Do Not Railroad**: The GM resists the urge to force the players to accept the job. Instead:
   "Alright, you decline. The stranger looks disappointed but leaves. You turn your attention to the
   disappearances. What is your first move?"

2. **Pivot Prep**: The GM has prepared ruins content (maps, encounters, clues). Instead of
   abandoning it, they pivot. The disappearances lead to an underground hideout. The ruins map
   becomes the hideout. The encounters fit thematically (cultists instead of ruin guardians). The
   artifact the stranger wanted is connected to the disappearances.

3. **Reframe Stakes**: The GM makes the main plot come to the players. As they investigate
   disappearances, they discover the kidnapped victims are being used in a ritual requiring the
   artifact from the ruins. The players' investigation and the stranger's job are now connected. The
   stakes are higher: people are dying.

4. **Ask Questions**: The GM asks: "You are investigating the disappearances. Where do you start?
   The families of the missing, the city guard, the locations they were last seen, or somewhere
   else?" This clarifies player intent and helps the GM focus improvisation.

5. **Deploy Modular Content**: The GM deploys a modular NPC from their bank: a grieving mother who
   provides leads. They also deploy a modular encounter: discovering a hidden basement with evidence
   of the ritual.

**Outcome**: The GM improvised a new session structure by pivoting prep, reframing stakes, and
deploying modular content. The players felt heard and empowered: their choice to investigate
disappearances mattered. The GM connected the ignored hook to the players' chosen path, creating a
richer narrative. The session succeeded despite the unexpected direction.
