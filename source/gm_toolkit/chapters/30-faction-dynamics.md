## Faction Design {#faction-design}

Factions are groups with goals, resources, and agency. They are not static background elements; they
act, react, and change based on player choices and world events. Factions create a living world
where the setting evolves with or without player intervention.

Factions can be organizations (guilds, governments, cults), communities (villages, tribes,
districts), or abstract forces (nature, cosmic entities, ideological movements). Factions drive
emergent narrative: their goals and conflicts create opportunities, threats, and hooks.

### Faction Template {#faction-template}

Design factions using this template:

**Name**: The faction's identity.

**Goals**: What the faction wants (short-term and long-term). Goals drive faction actions.

**Assets**: Resources, strengths, or advantages. What makes this faction powerful or influential?

**Weaknesses**: Vulnerabilities or limitations. What can undermine this faction?

**Key NPCs**: Leaders, agents, or representatives. Faces for the faction that players can interact
with.

**Hooks**: Story opportunities tied to the faction. What might draw players to interact with this
faction?

#### Example Faction: The Silver Compact (Merchant Guild)

- **Name**: The Silver Compact
- **Goals**: Control trade routes in the region; increase profits; gain political influence in the
  city council.
- **Assets**: Wealth, trade network, bribes and leverage over city officials, skilled negotiators
  and spies.
- **Weaknesses**: Greedy; vulnerable to rivals undercutting prices; internal corruption creates
  distrust.
- **Key NPCs**: Guildmaster Elara Voss (shrewd, calculating); Trade Captain Jareth (loyal but
  secretly embezzling).
- **Hooks**: Players need rare supplies only the Compact can provide; the Compact hires players to
  eliminate a rival merchant; Jareth's embezzlement threatens to expose the Compact's corruption.

### Goals and Motivations {#goals-and-motivations}

Faction goals create narrative drive. Goals should be clear, actionable, and conflicting with other
factions or player interests.

**Short-Term Goals**: Achievable within 1-3 sessions. Example: Secure a contract, eliminate a rival,
recruit new members.

**Long-Term Goals**: Achievable over an arc or campaign. Example: Control the region's economy,
overthrow the government, summon a deity.

**Conflicting Goals**: Factions with conflicting goals create natural tension and intrigue. Example:
The Merchant Guild wants to open trade with a neighboring kingdom; the Isolationist Council wants to
close borders.

### Assets and Weaknesses {#assets-and-weaknesses}

Assets make factions formidable. Weaknesses create opportunities for players (or rival factions) to
undermine them.

**Assets** (Examples):

- **Resources**: Wealth, weapons, magic, information.
- **Influence**: Political power, public support, blackmail.
- **Personnel**: Skilled agents, loyal followers, powerful leaders.
- **Territory**: Controlled regions, fortified locations, strategic positions.

**Weaknesses** (Examples):

- **Internal Conflicts**: Corruption, betrayal, rival subfactions.
- **External Pressure**: Rivals, enemies, resource scarcity.
- **Moral Limits**: Unwillingness to use certain tactics, adherence to codes.
- **Public Perception**: Unpopular, distrusted, vulnerable to scandal.

GM usage:

- Design 3-5 major factions per campaign or arc
- Give each faction clear goals, assets, and weaknesses
- Create key NPCs to personify factions
- Ensure faction goals conflict with each other or player interests
- Use assets to create faction power; use weaknesses to create player opportunities

## Faction Clocks {#faction-clocks}

**Faction clocks** track faction progress toward goals, escalating conflicts, or changing states.
Clocks make faction activity visible and create dynamic, evolving worlds.

### Types of Faction Clocks {#types-of-faction-clocks}

**Progress Clocks**: Track faction goals. When a progress clock fills, the faction achieves
something.

**Examples**:

- **The Thieves' Guild Consolidates Power** (8 segments): When filled, the Guild controls the city's
  underworld completely.
- **The Cult Summons the Demon** (6 segments): When filled, the demon is summoned.
- **The Rebellion Recruits Support** (10 segments): When filled, the rebellion has enough support to
  launch an uprising.

**Pressure Clocks**: Track threats or countdowns affecting factions. When a pressure clock fills,
something bad happens to the faction.

**Examples**:

- **The Merchant Guild's Corruption Exposed** (4 segments): When filled, the corruption becomes
  public and the Guild collapses.
- **The Kingdom's Food Supply Depleted** (6 segments): When filled, famine begins.
- **The Alliance Fractures** (5 segments): When filled, the alliance dissolves into infighting.

**Conflict Clocks**: Track escalating tensions between factions. When a conflict clock fills, open
conflict (war, duel, coup) erupts.

**Examples**:

- **Guild War Brewing** (6 segments): When filled, the two guilds go to war.
- **Noble Houses Clash** (8 segments): When filled, civil war begins.

### Advancing Faction Clocks {#advancing-faction-clocks}

Advance faction clocks based on:

- **Time Passing**: Advance clocks when in-game time passes (days, weeks, sessions). Factions act
  even when off-screen.
- **Faction Actions**: Advance clocks when factions successfully pursue their goals (NPCs complete
  missions, acquire resources, etc.).
- **Player Inaction**: Advance pressure or conflict clocks when players ignore threats or faction
  activities.
- **Player Actions**: Players can advance or reverse clocks through direct intervention. Helping a
  faction advances their progress clocks. Hindering a faction reverses their clocks or advances
  pressure clocks against them.

**Visibility**: Clocks can be visible (players know the cult is summoning a demon and see the clock
advancing) or hidden (players sense something is happening but do not know details). Use visible
clocks for known threats; hidden clocks for mysteries or slow-building danger.

GM usage:

- Create clocks for major faction goals and threats
- Advance clocks between sessions or when in-game time passes
- Let player actions affect clocks: helping or hindering factions matters
- Make some clocks visible, others hidden, based on player knowledge
- When clocks fill, show consequences in the fiction: factions succeed or fail visibly

## Inter-Faction Dynamics {#inter-faction-dynamics}

Factions do not exist in isolation. They interact: forming alliances, competing, or fighting.
Inter-faction dynamics create complexity and emergent narrative.

### Faction Relationships {#faction-relationships}

Map relationships between factions:

- **Allies**: Factions cooperate toward shared goals. Alliances can be stable or fragile.
- **Rivals**: Factions compete for resources, influence, or territory. Rivalry is tense but not
  violent (yet).
- **Enemies**: Factions actively oppose each other, often violently.
- **Neutral**: Factions have no strong relationship; they coexist without cooperation or conflict.

**Relationship Shifts**: Relationships change based on events, player actions, or faction goals.
Allies can become rivals. Rivals can become enemies. Enemies can forge temporary alliances against
greater threats.

**Example Relationship Map**:

- **The Silver Compact (Merchant Guild)** and **The Ironclad Union (Labor Guild)**: Rivals. The
  Compact exploits workers; the Union demands better conditions.
- **The Ironclad Union** and **The Reformist Council (Political Faction)**: Allies. Both seek to
  limit the Compact's power.
- **The Silver Compact** and **The Shadow Syndicate (Criminal Network)**: Neutral but tense. The
  Compact hires the Syndicate for dirty work but distrusts them.
- **The Reformist Council** and **The Shadow Syndicate**: Enemies. The Council seeks to eliminate
  crime; the Syndicate undermines reform efforts.

### Faction Conflicts {#faction-conflicts}

Conflicts between factions create dramatic stakes and player opportunities.

**Types of Conflicts**:

- **Economic**: Trade wars, price manipulation, resource competition.
- **Political**: Elections, coups, influence over authorities.
- **Territorial**: Disputes over land, borders, or strategic locations.
- **Ideological**: Opposing beliefs, values, or goals.
- **Violent**: Skirmishes, assassinations, open warfare.

**Escalation**: Conflicts escalate over time. Start with tension (rivals), escalate to sabotage
(covert actions), then open conflict (violence or war). Use conflict clocks to track escalation.

**Player Role**: Players can take sides, mediate, manipulate factions against each other, or remain
neutral. Player choices affect conflict outcomes.

GM usage:

- Map faction relationships (allies, rivals, enemies, neutral)
- Let relationships shift based on events and player actions
- Create conflicts between factions (economic, political, territorial, ideological, violent)
- Use conflict clocks to track escalation
- Let players intervene, take sides, or mediate conflicts

## Player Interaction with Factions {#player-interaction-with-factions}

Players interact with factions in multiple ways: joining, opposing, manipulating, or mediating.
Player-faction interaction drives emergent narrative.

### Joining Factions {#joining-factions}

Players can align with factions, gaining benefits but also obligations.

**Benefits**:

- **Resources**: Access to faction assets (gear, money, information, safe houses).
- **Support**: NPCs assist players (provide backup, intel, introductions).
- **Reputation**: Improved standing with the faction and its allies.
- **Missions**: Faction provides hooks and goals aligned with their interests.

**Obligations**:

- **Loyalty**: Players are expected to support faction goals.
- **Missions**: Factions assign tasks; refusal damages reputation.
- **Conflicts**: Aligning with one faction creates tension with rivals or enemies.

**Mechanics**: Track faction reputation with clocks or scales (see Chapter 11: Social Conflict).
High reputation grants benefits; low reputation imposes costs.

**Example**: Players join the Reformist Council. Benefit: The Council provides safe houses and
political support. Obligation: The Council expects players to undermine the Silver Compact and
Shadow Syndicate. If players refuse or act against Council interests, reputation falls.

### Opposing Factions {#opposing-factions}

Players can oppose factions, hindering their goals and creating enemies.

**Methods**:

- **Sabotage**: Disrupt faction operations (destroy supplies, steal assets, expose secrets).
- **Assassination**: Eliminate key NPCs (leaders, agents).
- **Propaganda**: Damage faction reputation publicly.
- **Alliances**: Join rival factions or form coalitions against the target faction.

**Consequences**:

- Factions retaliate: sending agents to attack, hiring assassins, or using political pressure.
- Faction goals are delayed or reversed (clocks are reduced or stalled).
- Reputation with the faction becomes hostile; players are marked as enemies.

**Example**: Players sabotage the Silver Compact's trade shipments. Consequence: The Compact's
"Control Trade Routes" clock is reduced by 2 segments. Retaliation: The Compact hires the Shadow
Syndicate to eliminate the players.

### Manipulating Factions {#manipulating-factions}

Players can manipulate factions, playing them against each other or steering them toward desired
outcomes.

**Methods**:

- **Deception**: Provide false information to provoke faction actions.
- **Leverage**: Use secrets or blackmail to force faction cooperation or inaction.
- **Mediation**: Broker alliances or peace between factions for player benefit.

**Example**: Players leak false information to the Silver Compact that the Shadow Syndicate plans to
betray them. The Compact attacks the Syndicate, weakening both factions and creating opportunities
for the players.

### Remaining Neutral {#remaining-neutral}

Players can avoid faction entanglements, remaining neutral and unaligned.

**Benefits**:

- Freedom to work with any faction without obligation.
- No enemies created by factional allegiances.
- Flexibility to choose missions and goals.

**Costs**:

- No faction support or resources.
- Factions may not trust neutral parties or may try to recruit or coerce them.
- Harder to gain reputation or influence without alignment.

GM usage:

- Let players join factions; grant benefits but impose obligations
- Let players oppose factions; show consequences and retaliation
- Let players manipulate factions; reward clever strategies but create risks
- Respect player neutrality but create pressure to choose sides
- Advance or reverse faction clocks based on player actions

## Emergent World Changes {#emergent-world-changes}

Faction activity creates emergent world changes. The world evolves based on faction successes,
failures, and conflicts. Emergent changes make the world feel alive and responsive.

### Clock-Driven Narrative {#clock-driven-narrative}

When faction clocks fill, the world changes visibly.

**Examples**:

- **The Cult Summons the Demon** (clock fills): A demon manifests in the city. The city descends
  into chaos. New factions form (demon worshippers, demon hunters). The campaign's tone and stakes
  shift.
- **The Rebellion Launches Uprising** (clock fills): The rebellion attacks the capital. The
  government mobilizes forces. Players must choose sides or flee. The map changes as territories
  shift.
- **The Merchant Guild's Corruption Exposed** (clock fills): The Guild collapses. Rival merchants
  seize control. Prices fluctuate wildly. NPCs associated with the Guild flee or seek revenge.

Clock-driven changes are not scripted outcomes; they are consequences of faction activity and player
choices. Players can prevent, delay, or accelerate clock fills through intervention.

### Faction Victories and Defeats {#faction-victories-and-defeats}

When factions achieve goals or are defeated, the world reflects the outcome.

**Faction Victories**:

- Faction gains power, influence, or territory.
- New opportunities arise (the victorious faction offers missions, alliances).
- Other factions react (rivals plan retaliation; allies seek to benefit).

**Faction Defeats**:

- Faction loses power, collapses, or is absorbed by rivals.
- Power vacuums create new conflicts (other factions compete to fill the void).
- NPCs associated with the defeated faction seek revenge, flee, or join new factions.

**Example**: The Silver Compact achieves its goal: controlling all trade routes. Victory: The
Compact dominates the economy. Prices rise. Rival merchants are forced out. The Ironclad Union
(labor guild) intensifies protests. New hook: The Union hires the players to sabotage the Compact.

**Example**: The Shadow Syndicate is defeated by the Reformist Council. Defeat: The Syndicate
collapses. Crime drops temporarily. Power vacuum: A new criminal organization rises to fill the
void, more brutal and organized. New hook: The Council asks players to investigate the new threat.

### Living World Principles {#living-world-principles}

**Principle 1: Factions Act Off-Screen**: Factions pursue goals even when players are not present.
Advance clocks between sessions. Show faction activity through NPC reports, rumors, or visible
changes (new guards, closed shops, burned buildings).

**Principle 2: Player Choices Matter**: Player actions affect faction success or failure. Helping a
faction advances their clocks. Opposing a faction delays them. Ignoring a faction allows them to act
unopposed.

**Principle 3: Consequences Ripple**: Faction changes affect other factions and the world. A faction
victory creates new tensions. A faction defeat creates power vacuums. Changes cascade.

**Principle 4: No Scripted Outcomes**: Do not script faction outcomes. Let clocks, player actions,
and faction interactions determine results. Be prepared to improvise when factions succeed or fail
unexpectedly.

GM usage:

- Advance faction clocks between sessions; show off-screen activity
- When clocks fill, show visible world changes
- Let faction victories and defeats reshape the world
- Create ripple effects: changes affect other factions and NPCs
- Embrace emergent outcomes; do not script faction success or failure

## Fronts and Countdowns {#fronts-and-countdowns}

**Fronts** are large-scale threats or campaigns with countdowns. Fronts represent faction-driven
dangers that escalate over time, forcing players to prioritize and act.

### Front Structure {#front-structure}

A front is a major threat with:

- **Name**: The threat's identity.
- **Goals**: What the front aims to achieve (catastrophic or world-changing outcomes).
- **Stages**: Phases of escalation (3-5 stages). Each stage represents progress toward the goal.
- **Countdown Clock**: A clock tracking front progress. When it fills, the front achieves its goal.
- **Portents**: Signs or events indicating front progress. Portents create tension and inform
  players.
- **Impending Doom**: What happens if the front succeeds. The catastrophic outcome.

#### Example Front: The Devouring Plague

- **Name**: The Devouring Plague
- **Goals**: Spread across the region; consume all life; transform the land into a blighted
  wasteland.
- **Stages**:
  1. Isolated outbreaks in remote villages.
  2. Plague spreads to towns; refugees flee.
  3. Major cities affected; quarantine fails.
  4. Plague mutates; infected become monstrous.
  5. The region is overrun; civilization collapses.
- **Countdown Clock**: 10 segments (advances 1 segment per session or when players ignore it).
- **Portents**:
  - Stage 1: Rumors of illness in a distant village.
  - Stage 2: Refugees arrive, carrying infection.
  - Stage 3: City gates close; supplies run low.
  - Stage 4: Infected creatures attack settlements.
  - Stage 5: The land itself withers; sky darkens.
- **Impending Doom**: The region becomes uninhabitable. Survivors flee or die. The campaign setting
  is destroyed.

### Running Fronts {#running-fronts}

**Advance the Front**: Progress the countdown clock based on time or player inaction. Advance
portents as the clock fills. Describe changes in the world to create urgency.

**Player Intervention**: Players can slow or stop fronts through direct action (research a cure,
destroy the source, rally defenses). Each success reduces the clock or delays advancement.

**Multiple Fronts**: Run 2-3 fronts simultaneously. Players must prioritize: stop the plague,
prevent the war, or thwart the cult? Choices have consequences; ignored fronts progress.

**Resolution**: Fronts resolve when players defeat them (clock is stopped or reversed) or when the
countdown fills (impending doom occurs). Either way, the world changes.

**Example Front Resolution**:

- **Success**: Players discover the plague's source (a corrupted magical artifact) and destroy it.
  The plague's clock stops at 7/10 segments. The plague is contained but not eradicated. Some towns
  are lost; others recover. Players are hailed as heroes.
- **Failure**: Players focus on other threats. The plague clock fills (10/10 segments). Impending
  doom occurs: the region collapses. Players must flee or adapt to a post-apocalyptic setting.

GM usage:

- Design fronts for major threats or campaigns
- Use countdown clocks and portents to create escalating tension
- Advance fronts based on time or player inaction
- Let players intervene to slow or stop fronts
- Run multiple fronts to force prioritization and hard choices
- Resolve fronts with visible consequences: success or catastrophic failure

## Worked Example: Three-Faction Intrigue Web {#worked-example-three-faction-intrigue-web}

**Campaign Setup**: The city of Greyhaven is a hub of trade, politics, and crime. Three factions vie
for control: The Silver Compact (merchants), The Reformist Council (politicians), and The Shadow
Syndicate (criminals). Players are independent operatives who can ally with, oppose, or manipulate
factions.

### Faction Profiles {#faction-profiles}

#### Faction 1: The Silver Compact (Merchant Guild)

- **Goals**: Control all trade routes; gain seats on the city council; maximize profits.
- **Assets**: Wealth, bribes, trade network, skilled negotiators.
- **Weaknesses**: Internal corruption (embezzlement); public perception (greedy, exploitative);
  rivals (Ironclad Union labor guild).
- **Key NPCs**: Guildmaster Elara Voss (shrewd, ruthless); Trade Captain Jareth (secretly embezzling
  funds).
- **Clocks**:
  - **Control Trade Routes** (progress, 8 segments): When filled, the Compact monopolizes trade.
  - **Corruption Exposed** (pressure, 4 segments): When filled, the Compact's corruption becomes
    public and the Guild collapses.

#### Faction 2: The Reformist Council (Political Faction)

- **Goals**: Limit corporate power; improve labor conditions; eliminate organized crime.
- **Assets**: Popular support, political influence, grassroots network.
- **Weaknesses**: Fractured leadership (internal disagreements); vulnerable to bribes and blackmail;
  idealistic (unwilling to compromise).
- **Key NPCs**: Councilor Mira Thane (idealistic reformer); Captain Aric Dray (city guard allied
  with Council).
- **Clocks**:
  - **Pass Reform Legislation** (progress, 6 segments): When filled, the Council enacts reforms
    limiting the Compact's power.
  - **Council Fractures** (pressure, 5 segments): When filled, internal disagreements split the
    Council; reform efforts stall.

#### Faction 3: The Shadow Syndicate (Criminal Network)

- **Goals**: Control the underworld; expand smuggling and extortion; corrupt city officials.
- **Assets**: Spies, assassins, blackmail material, fear and intimidation.
- **Weaknesses**: Hunted by the Council and city guard; internal power struggles (rival gangs);
  public hatred.
- **Key NPCs**: The Viper (mysterious crime lord, identity unknown); Shade (enforcer, loyal to the
  Viper).
- **Clocks**:
  - **Corrupt City Officials** (progress, 6 segments): When filled, the Syndicate controls key
    officials; Council reforms are blocked.
  - **Syndicate Hunted** (pressure, 4 segments): When filled, the Council and guard launch a major
    crackdown; Syndicate is driven underground or destroyed.

### Faction Relationships {#faction-relationships-1}

- **The Silver Compact** and **The Reformist Council**: Enemies. The Council seeks to limit the
  Compact's power. The Compact bribes officials to block reforms.
- **The Reformist Council** and **The Shadow Syndicate**: Enemies. The Council seeks to eliminate
  crime. The Syndicate sabotages reform efforts.
- **The Silver Compact** and **The Shadow Syndicate**: Neutral but tense. The Compact hires the
  Syndicate for dirty work (sabotaging rivals, intimidating labor organizers) but distrusts them.

### Interlocking Clocks {#interlocking-clocks}

The factions' clocks are interconnected:

- If the Compact's **Control Trade Routes** clock fills, the Council's **Pass Reform Legislation**
  clock slows (disadvantage; the Compact has too much power).
- If the Council's **Pass Reform Legislation** clock fills, the Compact's **Control Trade Routes**
  clock is reduced (reforms limit the Compact's monopoly).
- If the Syndicate's **Corrupt City Officials** clock fills, the Council's **Pass Reform
  Legislation** clock is blocked (corrupt officials sabotage reforms).
- If the Council's **Syndicate Hunted** clock fills, the Syndicate's **Corrupt City Officials**
  clock is reduced (Syndicate loses influence).

### Player Hooks {#player-hooks}

**Hook 1 (Compact)**: Guildmaster Elara Voss hires the players to eliminate a rival merchant
(secretly a Council ally). Payment: 500 gold and trade connections. Complication: If players accept,
the Council becomes hostile.

**Hook 2 (Council)**: Councilor Mira Thane asks the players to investigate the Compact's corruption.
Payment: Political favor and public recognition. Complication: The Compact retaliates if players are
discovered.

**Hook 3 (Syndicate)**: The Viper (through an intermediary) offers the players a job: smuggle cursed
artifacts into the city. Payment: 300 gold and Syndicate protection. Complication: The artifacts are
dangerous and illegal.

**Hook 4 (Neutral)**: A labor organizer (Ironclad Union) begs the players to protect workers from
Syndicate intimidation. Payment: None (they are poor), but the Union's gratitude and moral
satisfaction. Complication: The Syndicate targets the players.

### Campaign Flow (Sessions 1-6) {#campaign-flow-sessions-1-6}

#### Session 1: Introduction

- Players arrive in Greyhaven. They witness a protest (Ironclad Union vs Compact). They are
  approached by multiple factions offering jobs (hooks above).
- Players choose which hook to pursue. Their choice determines initial faction alignment.
- GM advances all faction clocks by 1 segment (off-screen activity).

#### Session 2: First Mission

- Players complete their chosen mission (smuggle artifacts, investigate corruption, eliminate rival,
  or protect workers).
- Outcome determines faction clock advancement: helping a faction advances their progress clocks;
  opposing a faction advances their pressure clocks.
- Example: If players investigate the Compact's corruption, they find evidence (Trade Captain Jareth
  is embezzling). The Compact's **Corruption Exposed** clock advances by 2 segments.

#### Session 3: Faction Reacts

- The faction players opposed retaliates. Example: If players exposed Jareth's embezzlement, the
  Compact hires the Syndicate to assassinate the players.
- Players must respond: fight, negotiate, or flee.
- GM advances clocks: Compact's **Control Trade Routes** (1 segment), Syndicate's **Corrupt City
  Officials** (1 segment), Council's **Pass Reform Legislation** (1 segment, but slowed by Syndicate
  corruption).

#### Session 4: Escalation

- Multiple clocks are filling. Tension rises. The Compact and Council clash publicly (debate in the
  city square). The Syndicate assassinates a Council member.
- Players must choose: intensify efforts with their allied faction, switch sides, or manipulate
  factions against each other.
- Example: Players leak the Compact's corruption evidence to the public. The **Corruption Exposed**
  clock fills (4/4 segments). The Compact collapses (Elara Voss flees; Jareth is arrested). The
  Council celebrates; the Syndicate moves to fill the power vacuum.

#### Session 5: Power Vacuum

- The Compact's collapse creates new conflicts. The Syndicate expands operations (**Corrupt City
  Officials** clock advances by 2 segments). The Council struggles to maintain order (**Council
  Fractures** clock advances by 1 segment due to disagreements on how to manage the transition).
- New hooks: The Council asks players to stop the Syndicate's expansion. The Syndicate offers
  players a deal: join them or be eliminated.
- Players choose their endgame strategy.

#### Session 6: Climax and Resolution

- Final confrontations. Players either help the Council eliminate the Syndicate or join/manipulate
  the Syndicate to control the city.
- **Possible Outcomes**:
  - **Council Victory**: The Council's **Pass Reform Legislation** clock fills. Reforms are enacted.
    The Syndicate is driven underground (**Syndicate Hunted** clock fills). Greyhaven becomes a
    reformed, lawful city. Players are hailed as heroes.
  - **Syndicate Victory**: The Syndicate's **Corrupt City Officials** clock fills. The Syndicate
    controls the city through corruption. The Council fractures (**Council Fractures** clock fills).
    Greyhaven becomes a criminal haven. Players are either powerful allies or enemies of the new
    order.
  - **Stalemate**: No faction fully wins. The city remains in tense balance. Players become power
    brokers, mediating conflicts and managing faction dynamics indefinitely.

### GM Preparation {#gm-preparation}

**Prep Before Play**:

1. Map faction clocks and relationships visually (draw diagram).
2. Prepare key NPCs (stats, goals, personalities).
3. Design hooks for each faction.
4. Prepare modular encounters (assassinations, investigations, chases, debates) deployable based on
   player choices.

**During Play**:

1. Track faction clocks each session. Advance based on time and player actions.
2. Let players choose faction alliances freely; do not railroad.
3. Show faction activity off-screen (NPCs report developments; visible changes in the city).
4. Adjust faction tactics based on player actions (factions react intelligently).
5. Build toward climax as clocks fill; make final sessions dramatic and consequential.

**Post-Campaign**:

- Reflect on faction outcomes. Which faction won? How did players' choices shape the city?
- Use outcomes as the foundation for future campaigns or arcs. Example: A Syndicate-controlled city
  becomes the setting for a rebellion campaign.
