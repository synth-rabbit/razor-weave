## Narrative Structure Layers {#narrative-structure-layers}

Quick reference for nested narrative structure and scope.

| Layer | Duration | Purpose | Components | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| Beat | 5-15 minutes | Single narrative moment | Frame → Stakes → Action → Consequence → Transition | "You approach the guard, explain your business, roll Persuasion, succeed, enter the mansion" |
| Scene | 20-45 minutes | Complete situation with stakes | 2-5 beats, location, present NPCs, immediate stakes | "Infiltrate the mansion through social engineering" |
| Sequence | 1-2 sessions | Mini-arc with rising tension | 2-5 connected scenes, escalating complications | "Investigate the murder: question suspects, search mansion, confront killer" |
| Arc | 3-8 sessions | Complete story with resolution | Setup → Development → Climax → Resolution, central conflict | "Stop the assassination plot against the duke" |
| Campaign | 10-50+ sessions | Collection of connected arcs | Multiple arcs, overarching themes, evolving world | "Prevent the return of the dark lord through connected quests" |

### Usage at Table

Scene opening:

- Frame location and present NPCs
- State immediate stakes clearly
- Ask players for intentions

Scene closing:

- Resolve immediate stakes
- Transition to next location or time
- Advance relevant clocks

Arc tracking:

- Check arc outline at session start
- Note milestones achieved
- Adjust remaining sessions as needed

## Scene Beats Quick Reference {#scene-beats-quick-reference}

Standard beat structure for any scene type.

### Five-Beat Structure

1. Frame: Establish location, NPCs, situation
2. Stakes: State what's at risk or what can be achieved
3. Action: Players declare intentions and roll if needed
4. Consequence: Narrate outcomes based on results
5. Transition: Connect to next beat or scene

### Scene Types and Beats

Investigation Scene:

- Frame: Location with clues or information sources
- Stakes: What information advances the arc
- Action: Searching, questioning, examining
- Consequence: Clues revealed, complications introduced
- Transition: New lead or location

Social Scene:

- Frame: NPC with goals and disposition
- Stakes: What can be gained or lost socially
- Action: Persuasion, deception, negotiation
- Consequence: Relationship shifts, information gained, obligations created
- Transition: Agreement, refusal, or next meeting

Combat Scene:

- Frame: Tactical situation, enemies, terrain
- Stakes: What victory and defeat mean
- Action: Initiative, attacks, positioning
- Consequence: HP changes, conditions applied, tactical shifts
- Transition: Victory, retreat, or complication

Exploration Scene:

- Frame: Unknown location or territory
- Stakes: What can be discovered or what threatens
- Action: Navigation, observation, interaction with environment
- Consequence: Discoveries, hazards, resources
- Transition: New location or information

### Quick Scene Assessment

Before opening scene, answer:

- Where are we? (location)
- Who's present? (NPCs)
- What matters? (stakes)
- What can players do? (options)

If you can't answer these, the scene may not be necessary. Consider montage or cut.

## Pacing Tools by Scope {#pacing-tools-by-scope}

Pacing techniques organized by narrative scope.

### Scene-Level Pacing (20-45 minutes)

Tools:

- Cut early: End scene when outcome is clear, not when conversation ends naturally
- Spotlight rotation: Cycle through players for input; don't let one player dominate
- Beat compression: Combine multiple rolls into one with broader stakes
- Tension spikes: Introduce complication mid-scene to raise energy
- Pressure clocks: Visible countdown creates urgency

Example: Players negotiate with merchant. After success, cut immediately to next location rather
than playing out entire transaction.

### Session-Level Pacing (3-4 hours)

Tools:

- Three-act structure: Opening hook (20 min) → Development (2 hours) → Climax/cliffhanger (45 min)
- Pressure/relief cycle: Alternate intense scenes with brief downtime
- Scene budget: Plan 3-4 major scenes per session
- Energy peaks: Place highest-energy scene about 2/3 through session
- Transitions: Use montage, time skips, and cuts to maintain momentum

Example session structure:

- Act 1: Recap and investigation (building tension)
- Act 2: Complication and choice point (high tension)
- Act 3: Action set piece or revelation (climax)
- Ending: Resolution beat and next session hook

### Arc-Level Pacing (3-8 sessions)

Tools:

- Milestone spacing: Plan 3-5 major story beats across arc
- Rising action: Each session escalates stakes or complications
- Clocks: Progress and pressure clocks track arc state
- Relief sessions: One lower-stakes session mid-arc for character development
- Climax positioning: Place arc climax in penultimate or final session

Example arc pacing:

- Session 1: Setup (introduce stakes and NPCs)
- Sessions 2-3: Development (investigation and complications)
- Session 4: Relief (character development, preparation)
- Session 5: Escalation (crisis point, raising stakes)
- Session 6: Climax and resolution

### Campaign-Level Pacing (10+ sessions)

Tools:

- Arc variety: Alternate arc types (mystery, action, social, exploration)
- Tone shifts: Change genre flavor between arcs
- Downtime arcs: Lower-stakes arcs for character development
- Escalating threats: Each arc has higher stakes than previous
- Seasonal structure: Campaign divided into acts with distinct phases

Example campaign pacing:

- Arc 1: Local threat (personal stakes, introduces setting)
- Arc 2: Regional threat (escalation, introduces factions)
- Downtime: Character-focused sessions
- Arc 3: National threat (high stakes, previous arcs converge)
- Arc 4: World threat (campaign climax)
- Epilogue: Resolution and aftermath

## Improvisation Prompts {#improvisation-prompts}

Use these prompts to improvise content when players take unexpected directions.

### NPC Creation (30 seconds)

When you need an NPC immediately:

1. Pick appearance detail (one distinctive feature)
2. Pick voice/manner (one speaking trait)
3. Pick goal (what do they want right now?)
4. Pick connection (how do they relate to existing NPCs or situation?)

Example: Players unexpectedly enter shop.

- Appearance: Scarred hands
- Voice: Speaks slowly, chooses words carefully
- Goal: Wants to close shop and go home
- Connection: Knew one of the murder victims

Result: Elderly shopkeeper with burn-scarred hands who speaks deliberately. Tired and wants to
close, but knew the victim and might share information if approached respectfully.

### Location Creation (30 seconds)

When players go to unplanned location:

1. Pick sensory detail (sight, sound, or smell)
2. Pick mood (welcoming, tense, mysterious, etc.)
3. Pick feature (one memorable element)
4. Pick connection (how does it relate to arc or world?)

Example: Players want to explore the docks.

- Sensory: Smells like salt and fish
- Mood: Tense (workers are nervous)
- Feature: Large warehouse with guards
- Connection: Warehouse belongs to NPC mentioned earlier

Result: The docks smell of salt and rotting fish. Workers are tense, casting nervous glances at a
large warehouse with unusual number of guards. The warehouse belongs to the merchant family from
earlier investigation.

### Complication Creation (immediate)

When scene is stalling or success is too easy:

Pick one:

- Someone unexpected arrives (ally, enemy, neutral)
- Environmental change (weather, hazard, discovery)
- Information revelation (overhear, find, realize)
- Resource pressure (time limit, cost increase, item breaks)
- Moral dilemma (innocent threatened, ally endangered, hard choice)

Example: Players easily convince guard to let them pass. Too easy. Add complication:

"The guard agrees, but as he opens the gate, you hear screams from inside. Something's wrong."

### Plot Thread Generation (1 minute)

When players want to pursue unexpected direction:

1. Accept player interest as valid
2. Connect new direction to existing elements
3. Identify what obstacle makes this interesting
4. Determine what success and failure mean

Example: Players want to investigate crime family instead of main plot.

- Accept: Crime family is now important
- Connect: Crime family has information about main plot villain
- Obstacle: Family is dangerous and well-protected
- Stakes: Success = valuable information and dangerous ally; Failure = make enemy of family

Result: New subplot that feeds back into main arc.

### "Yes, and..." Technique

Player suggests unexpected action. Respond with:

- "Yes" (accept premise)
- "And" (add complication or consequence)

Examples:

- Player: "I want to climb the tower outside." GM: "Yes, you can. And you notice guards patrolling
  the base who might spot you if you're not careful."
- Player: "Can I know this NPC from my past?" GM: "Yes, you knew them in the military. And they owe
  you a favor, but they're also wanted by the law."

### Reincorporation Prompts

When improvising, reference earlier elements:

- NPC mentioned once returns in new context
- Location visited early becomes important later
- Throwaway detail becomes clue
- Joke becomes plot point

Example: Players joked about how many cats are in the city. Later, investigation reveals the villain
is using cats as spies (familiar magic).

## Mystery Design Checklist {#mystery-design-checklist}

Use this checklist when designing mystery arcs.

### Core Mystery Elements

Before session:

- [ ] Define core truth (what actually happened)
- [ ] Identify guilty party (or reveal it's unsolvable mystery)
- [ ] List what's at stake (why this matters)
- [ ] Create timeline of events (past and ongoing)

### Three-Clue Rule

For each piece of essential information:

- [ ] Create at least three ways to discover it
- [ ] Place clues in different locations
- [ ] Make clues accessible via different skills/approaches
- [ ] Ensure at least one clue is hard to miss

Example: Essential info = "The poison came from the garden."

- Clue 1: Find poison vial in shed (Investigation)
- Clue 2: Gardener mentions rare plant (Social)
- Clue 3: Character with Nature skill recognizes symptoms (Knowledge)

### Node-Based Structure

Design investigation as network of nodes:

- [ ] Create 4-6 investigation nodes (locations, NPCs, or clue clusters)
- [ ] Each node provides 2-3 clues
- [ ] Each node points to at least 2 other nodes
- [ ] Multiple nodes lead to climax/confrontation
- [ ] No single point of failure (always multiple paths)

Example node map:

```text
Crime Scene → Victim's Home → Business Partner
     ↓              ↓                ↓
   Witness  →  Secret Ledger  →  Confrontation
                    ↓
                 Warehouse
```

### Information Distribution

Clue types:

- [ ] Core clues (advance investigation): Reveal on Partial success
- [ ] Supporting clues (add context): Reveal on Success
- [ ] Red herrings (complicate): Point to wrong conclusion initially
- [ ] Revelatory clues (twist): Change understanding of earlier info

Distribution:

- [ ] Spread clues across social, exploration, and investigation scenes
- [ ] Balance easy clues (maintain momentum) with hard clues (satisfaction)
- [ ] Hide some clues behind choices or risks
- [ ] Make some clues available only at certain times

### Failure Handling

Plan for investigation failures:

- [ ] Failed rolls reveal partial information with complication
- [ ] Failed rolls advance pressure clock (time limit, attention, danger)
- [ ] No "missed clue = stalled investigation" scenarios
- [ ] Alternative paths if primary investigation fails

Example: Player fails to pick lock on desk. Complication: Make noise, guard investigates.
Alternative: Question servant who has desk key.

### Revelation Pacing

Plan when to reveal information:

- [ ] Early: Basic facts (who, what, where)
- [ ] Middle: Context and connections (why, relationships)
- [ ] Late: Crucial truth or twist (real culprit, motive, stakes)
- [ ] Climax: Final confirmation and confrontation

Avoid:

- Revealing all information at once (no momentum)
- Withholding information too long (frustration)
- Making final revelation obvious too early (no tension)

### Mystery Health Check

During play, verify:

- [ ] Players understand basic facts of mystery
- [ ] Players have actionable leads to pursue
- [ ] Investigation is advancing each session
- [ ] Players are engaged and theorizing
- [ ] Mystery has momentum toward resolution

If any item fails, provide information infusion or redirect investigation.

## Faction Management Sheet {#faction-management-sheet}

Track multiple factions and their interactions.

### Faction Template

For each faction, track:

Faction Name: ________________

Tier: [ ] Local [ ] Regional [ ] National

Goal: What does this faction want?

Leader(s): Key NPCs

Assets: Resources, territory, capabilities

Weakness: Vulnerabilities or limitations

Clocks:

- Progress Clock (toward goal): ⬚ ⬚ ⬚ ⬚ ⬚ ⬚ (6 segments)
- Pressure Clock (external threat): ⬚ ⬚ ⬚ ⬚ (4 segments)

Relationships:

- Allied with: ________________
- Rivals with: ________________
- Neutral toward: ________________

PC Standing: [ ] Unknown [ ] Suspicious [ ] Neutral [ ] Trusted [ ] Allied

Hooks: How can PCs interact with this faction?

### Faction Turn (Between Sessions)

For each active faction:

1. Advance progress clock 1 segment if unopposed
2. Check if any faction actions affect others
3. Update relationships based on conflicts or alliances
4. Note visible changes PCs would notice
5. Prepare faction responses to PC actions

### Three-Faction Example

Factions in conflict:

Faction A: Merchant Guild (controls trade)

- Goal: Expand market control
- Progress: 3/6 segments
- Rival: Thieves' Guild
- Hook: Offers PCs mercenary work

Faction B: Thieves' Guild (controls underworld)

- Goal: Undermine merchant monopoly
- Progress: 4/6 segments
- Rival: Merchant Guild
- Hook: Blackmails PC with secret

Faction C: City Watch (maintains order)

- Goal: Reduce crime
- Progress: 2/6 segments
- Neutral: Both other factions (for now)
- Hook: Hires PCs as investigators

Interaction: If Thieves' Guild succeeds (fills clock), Merchant Guild loses assets, and City Watch
becomes hostile to Thieves. PCs must choose which faction to support or oppose.

### Faction Clock Interaction

When PCs act:

- Support faction: Advance their progress clock
- Oppose faction: Advance their pressure clock or reverse progress
- Ignore faction: Faction acts independently

When faction clock fills:

- Progress clock: Faction achieves goal; world changes; new goal set
- Pressure clock: Faction faces crisis; must respond or collapse

## Campaign Framework Comparison {#campaign-framework-comparison}

Quick comparison of major campaign frameworks to choose structure.

| Framework | Structure | PC Agency | Prep Load | Best For | Session Prep |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Episodic | Standalone sessions with optional continuity | High | Low | Casual play, varying attendance | 1-2 hours per session; minimal continuity |
| Linear | Authored plot with player-driven pacing | Medium | Medium | GMs who love storytelling; plot-focused groups | 2-3 hours per session; sequential content |
| Sandbox | Player-driven exploration with authored locations | Very High | High initial, Low ongoing | Exploration focus; proactive players | Heavy worldbuilding upfront; reactive prep |
| Hexcrawl | Procedural exploration with emergent narrative | Very High | Medium | OSR-style; random encounter lovers | Hex stocking; encounter tables; point-crawl maps |
| Fronts-Based | GM-authored threats with player-chosen priorities | High | Medium | Apocalypse World style; threat-focused | Threat clocks; countdown timers; reactive prep |
| Faction-Driven | Living world with competing interests | High | High | Political intrigue; dynamic world | Faction turns; relationship tracking; NPC goals |

### Framework Selection Guide

Choose based on table needs:

Episodic: "We want low-commitment pickup games with rotating attendance."

Linear: "We want epic story with clear direction but player choices matter."

Sandbox: "We want to explore and decide what's important; GM provides world."

Hexcrawl: "We want old-school exploration with survival and discovery."

Fronts-Based: "We want apocalyptic threats that advance unless we stop them."

Faction-Driven: "We want political intrigue with organizations pursuing goals."

### Blending Frameworks

Most campaigns blend frameworks:

- Linear main plot + Episodic side quests
- Sandbox exploration + Fronts-based threats
- Faction-driven politics + Linear story arcs
- Hexcrawl + Episodic encounters

Example hybrid: "Sandbox exploration (players choose where to go) with Fronts-based threats (world
events progress independently) and Episodic side content (locations have standalone adventures)."

## Storytelling Troubleshooting Flowchart {#storytelling-troubleshooting-flowchart}

Quick diagnostic for common problems.

### Engagement Problems

Players seem disengaged?

→ Are they participating actively?

YES → Check other issues

NO ↓

→ Is it all players or specific players?

All players: Check pacing or content issues

Specific players ↓

→ Talk to player privately

Ask: "Is everything okay? How can I make the game more fun for you?"

Possible causes:

- Spotlight imbalance → Rotate spotlight systematically
- Content mismatch → Adjust upcoming arcs to player interests
- Mechanical confusion → Provide rules help
- Social conflict → Mediate or address
- External factors → Offer flexibility or hiatus

### Arc Problems

Arc feels stalled?

→ Are players making progress each session?

YES → Arc is fine; feeling might be incorrect

NO ↓

→ What's blocking progress?

Players don't know what to do:

- Provide information infusion (NPC with clues)
- Restate stakes clearly
- Offer explicit options

Players have options but aren't choosing:

- Introduce complication that forces choice
- Fast-forward to next decision point
- Ask: "What's stopping you from deciding?"

Players aren't interested in arc:

- Ask: "Is this arc still interesting?"
- Offer pivot or new direction
- Consider ending arc early

### Pacing Problems

Sessions feel badly paced?

→ Too slow, too fast, or uneven?

Too slow:

- Cut unnecessary scenes
- Use montage for routine activities
- Speed up combat and mechanics
- Focus on player interests

Too fast:

- Slow down important moments
- Add relief scenes between intensity
- Give players time to discuss and plan
- Reduce number of scenes per session

Uneven:

- Plan energy curve (peaks and valleys)
- Use three-act structure
- Balance scene types (social, action, exploration)
- End scenes decisively with clear transitions

### Spotlight Problems

Spotlight feels imbalanced?

→ Are all players getting focus?

YES → Spotlight is balanced

NO ↓

→ Who's getting too much or too little?

One player dominates:

- Gently redirect: "Let's hear from others"
- Private conversation with dominant player
- Systematically rotate spotlight

One player is quiet:

- Open scenes with quiet player: "What's your character doing?"
- Private conversation: "Want more spotlight?"
- Create hooks tied to their character

All players seem passive:

- Present clear choices with stakes
- Ask specific players for input
- Frame scenes with "What do you do?"

### Tonal Problems

Tone feels wrong?

→ What's the mismatch?

Too dark/Too light:

- Discuss with players: "Is the tone working?"
- Adjust upcoming content
- Reaffirm Session Zero tone agreement

Genre confusion:

- Clarify genre explicitly
- Use genre-appropriate mechanics and costs
- Remove elements that don't fit genre

Safety concerns:

- Stop and check in immediately
- Use safety tools (X-card, pause)
- Private conversation after session
- Adjust content going forward

### General Diagnostic

Still not sure what's wrong?

Ask players directly:

- "Is the game fun?"
- "What's working and what's not?"
- "What do you want more or less of?"

Review health checklist (Chapter 17)

Take break and reflect

Consider campaign might be at natural end

Remember: Some campaigns conclude; that's okay
