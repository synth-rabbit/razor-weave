## Roles & Threat Ranks {#roles--threat-ranks}

Common roles

- Skirmisher: mobile pressure; punishes isolation
- Artillery: ranged damage/control; vulnerable in close
- Controller: space denial; creates hazards and splits teams
- Defender: anchors space; protects allies; punishes overreach
- Leader: amplifies others; coordinates focus and retreats

Threat ranks (guidance)

- T1 (Minor): a single misstep can drop them; 1 budget point
- T2 (Standard): credible foe; survives a couple strong hits; 2 points
- T3 (Elite): centerpiece of a scene; requires setup/flanks; 4 points
- T4 (Champion): set piece; demands terrain and support; 6 points
- T5 (Mythic): arc‑ender; treat as a scenario with phases; 10 points

## Building Enemies {#building-enemies}

Start from the fiction. Give each enemy 2–3 levers the GM can actually use.

Pick

- Attributes/Tags that matter (Slick Carapace, Bulky, Elevated Nest)
- One signature move (Hook Net, Suppressing Fire, Shatter Roar)
- One counterplay hook (break line of sight; bait a charge; disrupt chant)

GM usage

- State what Full/Partial/Fail mean when players target the enemy’s lever
- Telegraph counterplay via description and reactions
- On Partial, change space or clocks; avoid binary denial

## Encounter Budgets & Composition {#encounter-budgets--composition}

Simple rubric (party of 4, adjust ±1 point per PC)

- Low (4–5 points): skirmish; quick scene
- Standard (6–8 points): main beat; 1–2 clocks in play
- Hard (9–12 points): set piece; expect repositioning and retreats

Example (party of 5): add +1 point to the budget range — Low (5–6), Standard
(7–9), Hard (10–13). For a party of 3, subtract 1 point: Low (3–4), Standard
(5–7), Hard (8–11).

Composition patterns

- One T3 + two T1s (elite with screens)
- Two T2s + two T1s (paired threats with support)
- One T2 + terrain hazard (controller + lever)

DC cues (pick from fiction)

- 14 Routine: clear a screen, secure cover, suppress briefly
- 16 Tough: break formation, disarm, shove through hazard
- 18 Hard: disable a signature move under pressure

## Terrain & Synergy {#terrain--synergy}

Terrain is a force multiplier. Name 1–2 tags that meaningfully change play, and
make their effects explicit.

Examples

- Cramped + Slick: favors defenders and controllers; shoves are risky
- Elevated + Obscuring: favors artillery; demand Set Up to close safely
- Fragile Cover + Reinforcement Clock: encourages maneuver to degrade cover

GM usage

- On Partial, degrade cover, split teams, or tick pressure clocks you named
- Offer lines of play that flip the lever (clear cover, create quiet, flood the
  light)

## Behavior Scripts {#behavior-scripts}

Scripts keep spotlight moving and enemy choices legible.

Template

- Opening: establish role/lever (Skirmisher flanks; Controller seeds hazard)
- Mid‑fight: press advantage; protect lever; call for help on pressure 3+
- Exit: retreat when objective met or resolve low; offer parley/surrender

## Worked Composition Example {#worked-composition-example}

“Bridge Gate Push” (standard, 8 points; party of 4)

Tags: Cramped, Slick, Chokepoint. Clocks: Progress — Gate Forced (6); Pressure —
Reinforcements (6).

Foes (8 points)

- T3 Troll Gatekeeper (Defender/Controller): Shove to River (contest vs
  Maneuver), Regenerate in rain; Counterplay: grease planks or blind the eye
- Two T1 Spear Guards (Skirmishers): Pin Down at the chokepoint; Counterplay:
  pull them off line with bait
- Terrain Hazard: Slick Planks (Tag): impose Disadvantage on rushes unless
  secured

Beats & DC cues

- Set Up to sand/salt planks (DC 14, Routine) removes Slick for one pass
- Maneuver to shove the Troll (DC 16, Tough) or make space for two to rush
- Strike against Troll behind cover: Partial degrades cover; Full ticks Gate 2

Outcomes (example Maneuver vs Troll)

- Full: Troll moved; tick Gate Forced 2; cover degraded
- Partial: Troll resists; Reinforcements +1; add Tag: Exposed Position
- Fail: No progress; Reinforcements +2; Condition: Winded

GM usage

- Telegraphed counterplay: show the slick boards and the eye; reward setup
- On Partial, fill pressure you named; keep progress visible
- Offer exits: parley after Gate Forced 4, or retreat on Pressure 5+

### Worked Composition Variant — Alley Crossfire (Urban) {#worked-variant-alley-crossfire}

Tags: Cramped Alley, Fragile Cover (Crates), Elevated Balcony. Clocks: Progress
— Ringleader Cornered (6); Pressure — Patrol (6).

Foes (7 points, party of 4)

- T2 Ringleader (Leader/Skirmisher): Calls shots; Counterplay: cut sightlines
- Two T1 Lookouts (Artillery): Crossfire from balcony; Counterplay: smoke, Set Up
- T1 Knife Runner (Skirmisher): Flanks; Counterplay: block lanes, trip

Beats & DC cues

- Set Up (DC 14) smoke or tarp to break crossfire; degrades Fragile cover
- Maneuver (DC 16) to reach the balcony; risk Exposed if you rush
- Strike vs Lookout in cover: Partial degrades cover; Full ticks Ringleader 2

Outcomes (example Set Up)

- Full: Crossfire broken; tick Ringleader Cornered 2
- Partial: Crossfire reduced; Patrol +1
- Fail: No progress; Patrol +2; Tag: Exposed Position
