## Session Zero Agenda {#session-zero-agenda}

Session Zero is the foundation for a successful campaign. It is a collaborative planning session
where the table aligns on safety, tone, expectations, world details, and characters before play
begins. A thorough Session Zero prevents mismatches, sets boundaries, and builds investment.

A typical Session Zero runs 2-3 hours and covers the following agenda. Adjust timing based on table
needs.

**Agenda Overview** (2.5 hours):

1. Safety Tools and Boundaries (20 minutes)
2. Campaign Pitch and Tone (15 minutes)
3. Mechanics Overview and Questions (20 minutes)
4. Collaborative Worldbuilding (30 minutes)
5. Character Creation and Linking (45 minutes)
6. Immediate Hooks and First Session Preview (20 minutes)

**Preparation**: Before Session Zero, prepare a campaign pitch (genre, tone, core premise, expected
length) and decide on safety tools. Have character creation materials ready (see Player Guide and GM
Guide Chapter 7). Bring snacks and create a welcoming atmosphere; Session Zero sets the tone for the
entire campaign.

## Safety Tools and Calibration {#safety-tools-and-calibration}

Safety tools create a space where everyone can enjoy the game without crossing personal boundaries.
Implementing safety tools is not optional; it is fundamental to respectful play.

### Lines and Veils {#lines-and-veils}

**Lines** are topics that will not appear in the game at all. They are hard boundaries. Examples:
sexual violence, harm to children, graphic torture, spiders (for arachnophobes). If something is a
line, it does not exist in the game world.

**Veils** are topics that can exist in the game world but are not described in detail. They happen
off-screen or are summarized. Examples: violence is described but not graphically, romantic
relationships fade to black, disease exists but symptoms are not detailed.

**How to Implement**:

1. At the start of Session Zero, explain lines and veils clearly.
2. Provide paper or a shared document where everyone (including the GM) can anonymously write their
   lines and veils.
3. Collect and compile the list. The GM reviews and commits to honoring all lines and veils.
4. Revisit lines and veils periodically (every few sessions or when new players join).

**GM Responsibility**: The GM enforces lines and veils. If a player accidentally approaches a line
or veil, the GM redirects ("That is a veil for this table; let us summarize instead"). If a player
repeatedly ignores lines or veils, address it privately and, if necessary, remove them from the
table.

### X-Card {#x-card}

The X-Card is a safety tool allowing anyone to stop play when content becomes uncomfortable. It is
simple and non-disruptive.

**How to Implement**:

1. Place a card marked with an X in the center of the table (or use a digital equivalent in online
   play).
2. At Session Zero, explain: "If at any time something in the game makes you uncomfortable, tap the
   X-Card or type 'X' in chat. No questions asked, no explanation required. We will rewind or change
   the scene immediately."
3. When someone uses the X-Card, stop the current scene. Ask: "Do we rewind and take a different
   direction, or skip this entirely?" Respect the answer. Do not ask why or pressure for
   explanation.

**Normalization**: Use the X-Card yourself as GM during Session Zero to model its use. Example: "If
someone describes a plan involving [topic you find uncomfortable], I might X-Card it. This tool is
for everyone."

### Open Door Policy {#open-door-policy}

The Open Door policy allows anyone to leave the session at any time without explanation or judgment.
It acknowledges that people have limits and respects their need to step away.

**How to Implement**:

1. At Session Zero, state: "If you need to leave at any time, for any reason, you can. No
   explanation needed. Take care of yourself."
2. If someone leaves mid-session, do not follow them immediately or demand reasons. Check in
   privately after the session if appropriate.

### Script Change {#script-change}

Script Change is a set of verbal cues allowing players to adjust content intensity mid-scene.

**Cues**:

- **Rewind**: "Let us go back and take a different direction."
- **Fast Forward**: "Let us skip this part and summarize the outcome."
- **Pause**: "I need a moment to process; let us take a quick break."

**How to Implement**:

1. Explain the cues at Session Zero.
2. Encourage anyone (players or GM) to use them without explanation.
3. When a cue is used, honor it immediately.

### Calibration and Check-Ins {#calibration-and-check-ins}

Calibration is ongoing safety work. Check in with the table regularly to ensure everyone is
comfortable and having fun.

**How to Calibrate**:

- **Mid-Session Check**: During breaks, ask: "How is everyone feeling? Too intense? Too slow?
  Anything we should adjust?"
- **Post-Session Debrief**: Spend 5-10 minutes after sessions asking: "What worked? What did not?
  Anything we should change?"
- **Anonymous Feedback**: Provide a way for players to give anonymous feedback (shared document,
  survey, note cards) for those uncomfortable speaking up.

GM usage:

- Implement multiple safety tools; different people prefer different tools
- Explain all safety tools clearly at Session Zero
- Model use of safety tools yourself to normalize them
- Honor safety tool use immediately and without question
- Check in regularly; safety is ongoing, not one-time setup

## Tone and Expectations Alignment {#tone-and-expectations-alignment}

Tone and expectations must align across the table. Mismatched expectations create friction. Session
Zero is where alignment happens.

### Campaign Pitch {#campaign-pitch}

The GM presents the campaign pitch: genre, tone, premise, scope, and expected length. The pitch sets
expectations and allows players to opt in.

**Elements of a Pitch**:

- **Genre and Tone**: What kind of story is this? (Mystery, horror, cozy, high fantasy, political
  intrigue, etc.) What is the emotional tone? (Dark and serious, lighthearted, heroic, tense, etc.)
- **Core Premise**: What is the campaign about? (Investigating supernatural mysteries, surviving a
  zombie apocalypse, running a small-town bakery, overthrowing a tyrant, exploring strange worlds,
  etc.)
- **Expected Length**: How many sessions? (One-shot, short arc of 3-6 sessions, ongoing campaign,
  open-ended until natural conclusion.)
- **Player Agency**: How much is authored by the GM vs driven by players? (Linear plot, sandbox
  exploration, faction-driven emergent narrative, etc.)
- **Content and Themes**: What themes will appear? (Betrayal, loyalty, sacrifice, community,
  corruption, redemption, etc.) What mature content might be present? (Violence, horror, political
  conflict, romance, etc.)

**Example Pitch**: "This is a six-session mystery horror campaign. The premise: you are
investigators exploring a series of disappearances in a remote mountain town. Tone is tense and
atmospheric, with creeping dread and occasional scares. Expect investigation, social interaction,
and some combat. Violence and horror will be present but not graphic (veils apply). Player choices
will determine which leads you follow and how the mystery unfolds. Themes: isolation, trust,
uncovering uncomfortable truths."

### Genre Signals and Expectations {#genre-signals-and-expectations}

Once the pitch is delivered, discuss genre signals and expectations. What does this genre mean to
each player? What tropes are exciting? What cliches should be avoided?

**Discussion Questions**:

- What excites you about this genre?
- What tropes or elements do you want to see?
- What cliches or elements do you want to avoid?
- What is your experience with this genre? (New to horror? Veteran mystery player? Never played cozy
  games?)

**GM Role**: Listen and adjust. If the table is excited about elements you had not planned,
incorporate them. If the table dislikes elements central to your pitch, discuss alternatives or
reconsider the campaign.

### Campaign Framework Preview {#campaign-framework-preview}

Briefly describe the campaign framework (see Chapter 6: Campaign Frameworks): episodic, linear,
sandbox, fronts-based, faction-driven, or hybrid. Explain what this means for session structure and
player agency.

**Examples**:

- **Episodic**: Each session is a standalone mystery with optional continuity. Players can expect
  contained stories with clear resolution each session.
- **Sandbox**: The world is open; players choose where to go and what to pursue. Sessions are
  emergent based on player decisions.
- **Fronts-Based**: Multiple threats exist; players choose which to prioritize. The world changes
  based on inaction or action.

GM usage:

- Present a clear, specific campaign pitch
- Discuss genre expectations and tropes
- Explain the campaign framework and what it means for play
- Listen to player feedback and adjust if mismatches arise
- Ensure everyone is excited about the campaign before proceeding

## Collaborative Worldbuilding {#collaborative-worldbuilding}

Collaborative worldbuilding creates shared investment. When players help build the world, they care
about it. This section provides prompts and structures for collaborative worldbuilding during
Session Zero.

### Worldbuilding Boundaries {#worldbuilding-boundaries}

Set boundaries: What is fixed (core premise, major factions, key NPCs) and what is open for
collaboration (locations, minor NPCs, local culture, recent events)?

**Example Boundaries**: "Fixed: The kingdom is ruled by a weak monarch; three noble houses vie for
power; magic is rare and dangerous. Open: Your characters' home regions, local customs, what your
family does, recent events in your area."

### Collaborative Prompts {#collaborative-prompts}

Ask players to contribute world details during Session Zero. Use prompts that tie to their
characters or the setting.

**Location Prompts**:

- "Where is your character from? Describe the place: what is it known for?"
- "Name a local landmark or feature in your region. Why is it significant?"
- "What is the local industry or resource? How does it shape the culture?"

**Cultural Prompts**:

- "What is a local festival or tradition? What does it celebrate?"
- "What is a common saying or superstition in your region?"
- "What is the relationship between your region and the capital/central authority?"

**NPC Prompts**:

- "Who is someone important in your character's life? Describe them."
- "Who is a local figure everyone knows (mayor, merchant, elder, troublemaker)? What are they like?"
- "Who is someone your character trusts? Who is someone they distrust?"

**Recent Events Prompts**:

- "What recent event has everyone talking in your region?"
- "What local problem or conflict is brewing?"
- "What is a local mystery or rumor?"

**GM Role**: Record contributions. Build on player ideas. Connect disparate contributions into a
cohesive world. Example: One player says their region is known for mining; another says their
character distrusts a local merchant. The GM connects them: the merchant is accused of selling
substandard mining equipment, leading to recent accidents.

### Veto Rights and Collaboration Limits {#veto-rights-and-collaboration-limits}

GMs retain veto rights. If a player contribution breaks the world, contradicts core premises, or
creates tonal mismatch, the GM can veto and propose alternatives.

**How to Veto Respectfully**:

1. Acknowledge the contribution: "I like that idea."
2. Explain the conflict: "It does not fit because [reason]."
3. Offer an alternative: "What if instead [adjusted version]?"

**Example**: Player: "My character is from a high-tech city with robots." GM: "I like the advanced
city idea, but robots do not fit this low-magic medieval setting. What if instead your city is known
for advanced clockwork and intricate machines, but no true AI or robots?" Player: "That works!"

### Shared Worldbuilding Tools {#shared-worldbuilding-tools}

Use tools to capture collaborative worldbuilding:

- **Shared Document**: Google Doc or equivalent where everyone records contributions.
- **Index Cards**: Physical or digital cards for locations, NPCs, factions. Players can add cards
  during Session Zero.
- **Map**: Collaborative map where players mark their home regions, landmarks, or points of
  interest.

GM usage:

- Set clear boundaries: what is fixed, what is open for collaboration
- Use prompts to guide contributions toward useful details
- Record all contributions and build connections between them
- Veto respectfully if necessary; offer alternatives
- Use shared tools to make worldbuilding visible and accessible

## Character Linking and Party Formation {#character-linking-and-party-formation}

Characters need reasons to work together. Character linking creates pre-existing relationships and
shared goals, avoiding the "you all meet in a tavern" problem.

### Linking Methods {#linking-methods}

**Method 1: Shared Background**: All characters come from the same place, organization, or event.
Examples: same hometown, same military unit, same guild, survivors of the same disaster.

**Method 2: Web of Relationships**: Characters know each other through chains of relationships.
Player A knows Player B from childhood. Player B met Player C during travels. Player C owes Player D
a debt. Everyone is connected by one or two degrees.

**Method 3: Shared Goal**: Characters have different backgrounds but share an immediate goal.
Examples: all hired by the same patron, all seeking the same artifact, all fleeing the same threat.

**Method 4: Dramatic Hook**: Characters are thrown together by circumstance. Examples: all
passengers on a crashing ship, all witnesses to a crime, all accused of a crime they did not commit.

### Linking Questions {#linking-questions}

Use questions to create links between characters:

- "How do you know [other character]? When did you meet?"
- "What is your relationship? (Friends, rivals, family, professional colleagues, strangers with
  common cause?)"
- "Why do you trust [other character]? Or do you?"
- "What do you owe [other character], or what do they owe you?"
- "What shared experience binds you together?"

### Bonds and Flags {#bonds-and-flags}

Encourage players to create bonds (relationships) and flags (narrative hooks) during character
creation. Bonds tie characters together. Flags tell the GM what each player wants to explore.

**Bonds** (see Player Guide): Mechanical and narrative links between characters. Example: "I owe
[character] a life debt" or "I am protecting [character] from a secret."

**Flags** (see Player Guide): Topics, themes, or story beats players want to engage. Example: "I
want to explore my character's fear of failure" or "I want to uncover my character's mysterious
past."

GM usage:

- Use linking methods to create party cohesion before play begins
- Ask linking questions to establish relationships and history
- Encourage bonds and flags; record them and incorporate into play
- Ensure every character has at least one link to another character
- Build immediate hooks that engage all characters, not just individuals

## Immediate Hooks and First Session Setup {#immediate-hooks-and-first-session-setup}

Session Zero ends with setup for the first session. Provide immediate hooks so players know what
their characters are doing when play begins.

### The Opening Scene {#the-opening-scene}

Describe the opening scene of Session One. Where are the characters? What is happening? What stakes
are immediately present?

**Example Openings**:

- "Session One begins with all of you gathered in the village square. The mayor has just announced
  that children have gone missing. Parents are frantic. The mayor looks at you and says, 'You are
  outsiders, but you have skills. Will you help?'"
- "Session One begins mid-action: you are in the ruins, torches guttering, as you hear footsteps
  echoing behind you. Whatever you woke up is hunting you now."
- "Session One begins at the festival. Music plays, people celebrate, but you all notice something
  is wrong. The mayor is acting strangely. What do you do?"

### Immediate Questions {#immediate-questions}

Give players immediate questions to answer during the first session. Questions create engagement and
agency.

**Examples**:

- "What do you do first: investigate the disappearances, talk to the parents, or search the last
  known location?"
- "How do you react when the mayor asks for help? Do you agree immediately, negotiate payment, or
  hesitate?"
- "What catches your attention at the festival? The mayor's strange behavior, the nervous guards, or
  the hooded stranger watching from the shadows?"

### Prep Between Session Zero and Session One {#prep-between-session-zero-and-session-one}

Ask players to prep between Session Zero and Session One:

- Finalize character details (appearance, personality, bonds, flags).
- Think about character goals for the first session.
- Review mechanics relevant to their character (skills, conditions, resources).

GM prep between sessions:

- Incorporate collaborative worldbuilding contributions into session notes.
- Build NPCs and locations based on player contributions.
- Design the first session to engage character bonds and flags.
- Prepare opening scene and immediate hooks.

GM usage:

- Describe the opening scene clearly
- Provide immediate questions and stakes
- Give players time to ask questions about the setup
- Assign light prep for both players and GM between Session Zero and Session One
- Start Session One with momentum; recap Session Zero contributions briefly and dive in
