## Expansion Plan {#expansion-plan}

- Synthesize best practices from rules into a retail-grade, stepwise procedure
  (frame → set stakes → check → narrate → react).
- Add two fully annotated examples (exploration and social) with DC cues and
  Partial beats.
- Provide a one‑page checklist sidebar for live facilitation.

## Framing Scenes {#framing-scenes}

### Framing Checklist {#framing-checklist}

- Where are we? (location + relevant tags)
- Who is here? (PCs/NPCs, intent, leverage)
- What matters? (objective, resources at risk)
- Why now? (time pressure, clock states)
- What could change? (stakes on Full/Partial/Fail)

GM Prompts: “What do you do?” “What would success look like?” “What are you risking?”

### Procedure (Frame → Stakes → Check → Narrate → React) {#frame-stakes-check}

1) Frame: Paint only what matters now. Name 1–2 Tags on the space (e.g., Dim,
   Crowded, Slick) that will actually influence play.
2) Stakes: Say what Full / Partial / Fail mean before dice. Tie at least one
   outcome to a clock or tag change.
3) Check: Pick the right tool (Skill/Proficiency) and a DC from the ladder
   (12 easy · 14 routine · 16 tough · 18 hard · 20 heroic · 22 legendary).
   Consider Advantage/Disadvantage from fiction, not numbers alone.
4) Narrate: Translate the tier result into fiction. On Partial, introduce
   pressure (tick a clock, impose a Tag/Condition) but let progress continue.
5) React: Update clocks, tags, positions, and ask the table what they do next.
   Offer a meaningful follow‑up choice.

### Sidebar — Clean Framing (Quicklist) {#sidebar-clean-framing}

- State objective and why it matters now
- Name 1–2 tags that will actually influence play
- Pre‑state Full/Partial/Fail and any pressure clocks in effect
- Point to a clear follow‑up choice after the first outcome

## Stakes, Costs, and Outcomes {#stakes-costs-and-outcomes}

### Outcome Matrix {#outcome-matrix}

- Critical Success: objective plus advantage (free clear, bonus position)
- Full Success: objective achieved cleanly; tick progress if applicable
- Partial Success: objective with cost or complication; tick pressure or apply tag/condition
- Failure: no objective; escalate danger; reveal new obstacle or cost
- Critical Failure: decisive turn against PCs; trigger a major pressure event

GM Usage: Pre‑state beats; prefer costs that move the story (time, position,
resource, attention) over binary denial.

Tier Cues (quick examples)

- Full: “You cross unseen and arrive on the balcony.” (Tick progress 1)
- Partial: “You cross, but guards grow suspicious.” (Tick pressure 1:
  Suspicion; add Tag: Exposed)
- Fail: “You’re spotted; a horn sounds.” (Advance Reinforcements 2; add
  Condition: Pinned)

Always frame costs the table can feel: time lost, noise made, cover broken,
resources drained, attention drawn.

## Pacing with Clocks {#pacing-with-clocks}

### Clock Patterns {#clock-patterns}

- Progress vs Pressure: fill progress on Full; pressure on Partial/Fail
- Sizes: 4/6/8 segments; pick based on scene length and risk
- Chains: allow one clock to spill into another at thresholds
- Visuals: keep clocks visible; fear rises as hands advance

Sizing advice

- Short, punchy scenes: 4‑segment progress and 4‑segment pressure
- Standard, tense scenes: 6‑segment progress and 6‑segment pressure
- Extended set pieces: 8‑segment progress; 6‑segment pressure (pressure resolves
  faster)

## Ending & Transitioning {#ending--transitioning}

Close on resolution (progress full) or consequence (pressure full). Summarize
change: how the fiction looks different. Offer momentum hooks: “Do you press
your advantage?” “Do you regroup?” Update tags/conditions; clear what makes
sense; tick campaign clocks.

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

- Exploration: “Fogbound Orchard” (mystery/horror); uses Thick Fog, Survival;
  show Partial consequences.
- Social: “Festival Permit” (cozy); uses Crowded, Negotiation; show mixed outcomes and costs.

Outline Details

- Fogbound Orchard: stakes (find healer’s herb before night); tags (Thick Fog,
  Slick); DC ladder for Survey/Navigation; Partial fills Suspicion wildlife
  clock; Fail triggers misstep hazard.
- Festival Permit: stakes (secure permit before parade); tag (Crowded); DCs for
  Negotiation and Event Planning; Partial wins permit with strings (task or
  schedule change); Fail draws bureaucratic scrutiny clock.

### Worked Example 1 — Fogbound Orchard (Exploration) {#ex-fogbound-orchard}

Setup: The party must locate a rare herb before nightfall to save an injured
villager. The orchard sits in a valley; fog rolls in at dusk.

Tags in play: Dim, Obscuring (Thick Fog); Slick (mud)
Clocks: Progress — Herb Found (6). Pressure — Night & Predators (6).

Framing: “You stand at the orchard’s edge. Fog curls between low trees and
clings to your boots. If you succeed, you’ll find the herb before night. On a
Partial, you’ll find signs and lose time; on a Failure, you’ll veer off,
drawing things that hunt by sound.”

Action: Survey the orchard and navigate quietly.
Checks:

- Perception/Survival (DC 16, Tough) to orient by growth patterns and wind.
- Stealth (DC 14, Routine) to keep noise low; Dim grants Advantage if moving
  slowly.

Results:

- Full: Tick Herb Found 2; describe a clear trail of dew‑heavy leaves leading
  inward.
- Partial: Tick Herb Found 1 and Night & Predators 1; add Tag: Off‑Track. “You
  find crushed stems—close—but your path circles a low bog.”
- Fail: No progress; tick Night & Predators 2; impose Condition: Winded or Tag:
  Loud Footfalls (player choice). “A branch snaps; the orchard answers with
  sudden silence.”

On Critical Success: Clear Off‑Track or remove Loud Footfalls, and tick Herb
Found 2 as you discover a direct path through leaning trunks.

Follow‑ups: Offer choices—press deeper with speed (drop Advantage) or slow down
(protect Advantage, risk time). On a later Crit, allow clearing Off‑Track or
removing Loud Footfalls.

GM Usage: Keep both clocks visible. Narrate fog as a lever: better stealth,
worse navigation. On Partial, pay with time or attention, not dead ends.

### Worked Example 2 — Festival Permit (Social) {#ex-festival-permit}

Setup: The party must secure an event permit before the parade starts. The
office is jammed; the clerk is overworked and by‑the‑book.

Tag in play: Crowded (noise distracts, +2 DC to serious requests unless you
control space)
Clock: Pressure — Bureaucratic Scrutiny (6): inspections, missing forms,
manager’s review.

Framing: “If you succeed, the permit is granted cleanly. On a Partial, you get
it with strings—an errand or a delay. On a Failure, scrutiny rises—someone
higher up notices you.”

Actions: Negotiation (Find Middle), Event Planning (Schedule), and Streetwise
(Find Ally in Line).
Checks:

- Negotiation (DC 16, Tough): reasoned case; Crowded raises to DC 18 unless you
  create quiet space (Set Up).
- Event Planning (DC 14, Routine): present a safe route with contingencies.
- Streetwise (DC 14, Routine): enlist a regular to vouch; converts Crowded to
  Helpful once per scene.

Results:

- Full: Permit granted; note an inspector ally. “Your plan anticipates their
  concerns; stamp, signature, done.”
- Partial: Permit granted with condition: complete a quick community task or
  accept a narrower window; tick Scrutiny 1.
- Fail: Permit delayed; Scrutiny +2; add Tag: Flagged Application. “The manager
  wants to ‘take a look’—soon.”

Follow‑ups: Offer tradeoffs—accept narrower scope (reduced footprint) for time
saved, or take the task to clear Flagged Application. Use the ally to flip
Crowded into a boon for one check.

GM Usage: Make noise and space tangible levers. Partial outcomes should create
choices that keep the festival moving, not stonewall it.
