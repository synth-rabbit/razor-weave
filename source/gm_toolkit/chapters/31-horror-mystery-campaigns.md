## Horror Fundamentals {#horror-fundamentals}

Horror thrives on atmosphere, not mechanics. It emerges from dread, uncertainty, and the slow
erosion of safety. The goal is to make players feel tension while keeping their characters in
motion.

### Dread vs Shock

Dread builds over time through atmosphere, foreshadowing, and escalating uncertainty. Shock delivers
sudden impact through reveals or violence. Effective horror balances both: dread sustains tension,
shock punctuates it.

Dread tools:

- Repeated sensory details that suggest wrongness
- Clocks that tick without clear consequences
- NPCs who behave erratically or know too much
- Environments that shift subtly between scenes

Shock tools:

- Sudden reveals after prolonged tension
- Failed rolls that introduce immediate danger
- Environmental hazards triggered by investigation
- NPC betrayals or transformations

### Atmosphere Building

Atmosphere comes from what you emphasize in descriptions and what you withhold. Focus on sensory
details that suggest threat without confirming it.

Atmosphere techniques:

- Describe sound and smell before sight
- Use silence as a tool; pause before answering questions
- Repeat specific details to create pattern recognition
- Leave gaps in descriptions; invite players to fill them

Example atmosphere cues:

- "The hallway smells like copper and wet earth."
- "You hear breathing, but it matches your own rhythm."
- "The door is open exactly as wide as when you left."
- "Everything is where it should be. That's what bothers you."

### Pacing Dread

Horror pacing differs from action pacing. Stretch scenes longer than comfortable, compress relief
moments, and escalate pressure through accumulation rather than spikes.

Pacing structure:

1. Establish normalcy with one safe scene
2. Introduce wrongness through subtle details
3. Escalate wrongness through investigation
4. Deliver shock after prolonged dread
5. Offer brief relief that feels incomplete
6. Repeat with higher baseline tension

GM usage:

- Time horror scenes by player discomfort, not clock
- Use pressure clocks that advance on investigation, not just failures
- Compress travel and preparation; expand investigation and confrontation
- Cut relief scenes before full resolution

## Mystery Integration {#mystery-integration}

Horror and mystery pair naturally. Investigation drives players into danger while dread makes them
hesitate. The tension between curiosity and caution creates compelling choices.

### Investigation Pacing in Horror

Horror mysteries reward slow investigation. Use the three-clue rule but deliver clues with cost.
Every answer should raise new questions or introduce complications.

Investigation structure:

- Core clues reveal on Partial successes with complications
- Supporting clues reveal on Successes but with atmospheric cost
- Failures introduce danger or corrupt existing information
- Red herrings reinforce theme or foreshadow true threat

GM usage:

- Plant three routes to each core clue
- Make clues visceral: not just information but experience
- Use conditions as investigative costs (Shaken, Paranoid, Obsessed)
- Reward investigation with dread escalation, not safety

### Information as Horror

The unknown terrifies more than the known. Control information flow to maximize uncertainty. Reveal
mechanics partially, describe threats incompletely, and let players imagine worse than reality.

Information techniques:

- Describe effects before causes
- Use unreliable narration for perception-based rolls
- Provide conflicting clues from different sources
- Reveal threats through absence and negative space

Example information reveals:

- Partial (5): "You find three sets of tracks. Two enter the room. Five leave."
- Success (7-9): "The ritual circle is fresh. The symbols match the book, but they're inverted.
  Someone tried this wrong, or they tried something else."
- Critical (10+): "The chalk is still warm. They finished this within the last hour, and the circle
  isn't for summoning. It's for hiding."

## Fear and Stress Mechanics {#fear-and-stress-mechanics}

Horror campaigns benefit from mechanics that track psychological erosion alongside physical harm.
Use conditions, clocks, and breaking points to make fear tangible without removing agency.

### Fear Conditions

Fear conditions represent temporary psychological states triggered by horror. They impose narrative
costs and mechanical complications without disabling characters.

Example fear conditions:

- Shaken: -1 to first roll in each scene until you take protective action
- Paranoid: You must ask one suspicious question before trusting information
- Obsessed: You must pursue investigation leads even when risky
- Unraveling: Describe one irrational behavior each scene

GM usage:

- Apply fear conditions on failures against horror threats
- Let players clear conditions through roleplay or downtime
- Use conditions to suggest choices, not dictate them
- Escalate conditions if ignored (Shaken → Paranoid → Unraveling)

### Stress Clocks

Stress clocks track cumulative psychological pressure over multiple scenes. They represent breaking
points, not immediate failure. When a stress clock fills, the character faces a crisis that demands
meaningful choice.

Stress clock structure:

- 4-segment clock for single-session horror
- 6-segment clock for arc-length horror
- Advance on exposure to horror, failed saves, or voluntary investigation
- Fill triggers crisis scene, not automatic breakdown

Crisis options when clock fills:

- Break: Take major condition but gain clarity on threat
- Flee: Remove self from danger but abandon investigation
- Deny: Refuse to acknowledge threat; gain temporary calm but future vulnerability
- Confront: Face fear directly with boosted stakes

GM usage:

- Make clock fills dramatic moments, not punishment
- Offer meaningful choices at crisis points
- Allow recovery through resolution or downtime
- Use multiple PCs filling clocks near-simultaneously for ensemble horror

### Breaking Points

Breaking points occur when stress clocks fill or when characters face overwhelming horror. They
create dramatic moments where players choose how their character responds to fear.

Breaking point procedure:

1. Announce the breaking point trigger
2. Describe the immediate horror
3. Offer three response options (break/flee/deny/confront)
4. Resolve choice with appropriate mechanical consequence
5. Adjust character state and campaign tension

GM usage:

- Telegraph breaking points one scene ahead
- Make all options costly but viable
- Respect player choice even if it derails investigation
- Use breaking points to reveal character depth

## Information Control and Uncertainty {#information-control-and-uncertainty}

Horror depends on what players don't know. Control information through timing, reliability, and
presentation to maintain uncertainty without frustrating investigation.

### Partial Revelations

Reveal information in layers. First impressions mislead, second looks add detail, and full
understanding comes only through accumulation and risk.

Revelation structure:

- Immediate: Sensory surface (sight, sound, smell)
- Investigation: Context and history
- Risk: Mechanics and true nature
- Crisis: Implications and cost

Example revelation layers (ritual site):

- Immediate: "The basement smells like charcoal and rust."
- Investigation (Partial): "The floor has scorch marks in a circle. Recent."
- Investigation (Success): "The symbols are protection wards, but they're drawn backward. This
  doesn't keep something out. It keeps something in."
- Risk (touching the circle): "The wards flare blue. You feel a pull from below, and something
  responds."

### Unreliable Narration

Use perception-based rolls to introduce uncertainty about reality. Describe what characters
experience, not objective truth. Let players wonder if they can trust their senses.

Unreliable narration triggers:

- Failed perception checks return false positives
- Partial successes provide accurate information with misleading context
- Critical successes confirm truth but introduce new uncertainty
- Conditions (Paranoid, Obsessed) color future narration

GM usage:

- Describe perception failures as positive experiences, not absences
- Mix true and false details on partials
- Let players compare notes to identify discrepancies
- Confirm or deny reality only when mechanically necessary

### The Unknown

Some horror works best when never fully explained. Preserve mystery by revealing enough to act but
not enough to dismiss. Let players imagine horrors beyond what you describe.

Techniques for preserving mystery:

- Describe threats through effects on environment and NPCs
- Provide contradictory information from credible sources
- Reveal mechanics partially (some vulnerabilities, not all)
- End some investigations with ambiguous resolution

GM usage:

- Decide in prep what stays unknown
- Distinguish need-to-know (mechanics for confrontation) from mystery (origin, nature)
- Respect player curiosity but reward it with deeper questions
- Use aftermath scenes to suggest unresolved elements

## Cosmic Horror vs Personal Horror {#cosmic-horror-vs-personal-horror}

Horror scales from intimate dread to existential terror. Cosmic horror emphasizes insignificance and
incomprehensibility. Personal horror emphasizes violation and loss. Both work in the same campaign
at different scales.

### Cosmic Horror

Cosmic horror presents threats beyond human understanding or resistance. It emphasizes
powerlessness, incomprehensibility, and the insignificance of human concerns.

Cosmic horror elements:

- Threats with unclear motives or alien logic
- Victories that reveal larger dangers
- Knowledge that corrupts rather than empowers
- Scale that dwarfs human agency

Cosmic horror mechanics:

- Stress clocks that advance on learning truth
- Conditions triggered by comprehension (Enlightened, Marked)
- Victories that pause threats but don't eliminate them
- Resolution through acceptance or sacrifice, not triumph

GM usage:

- Keep threat mechanics simple; complexity lives in description
- Make investigation reveal scale, not solutions
- Offer victories that matter without implying control
- Use cosmic horror sparingly; contrast with human-scale stakes

### Personal Horror

Personal horror focuses on violation, loss, and transformation. It makes threats intimate and
consequences permanent. The danger threatens identity, relationships, or body.

Personal horror elements:

- Threats that know or target the PCs specifically
- Stakes rooted in character bonds and history
- Transformation or corruption over time
- Moral compromises with lasting consequences

Personal horror mechanics:

- Conditions that change character abilities or restrictions
- Clocks representing corruption or transformation
- Social costs that damage bonds and reputation
- Choices between bad options with permanent effects

GM usage:

- Root horror in character flags and bonds
- Make consequences visible in roleplay and mechanics
- Use personal horror to escalate cosmic horror (the alien becomes intimate)
- Allow some victories to preserve agency and hope

### Blending Scales

Effective horror campaigns often blend cosmic and personal elements. Cosmic horror provides the
setting and stakes. Personal horror provides the emotional weight and immediate danger.

Blending structure:

- Open with personal horror to establish tone and stakes
- Introduce cosmic elements gradually as investigation deepens
- Use personal consequences to make cosmic horror tangible
- Resolve cosmic arcs through personal sacrifice or transformation

Example blend:

- Arc opens with personal stakes (missing family member)
- Investigation reveals cosmic threat (ritual to summon entity)
- Personal horror escalates (PCs marked by entity, relationships strained)
- Resolution requires personal sacrifice (break bond to close portal)
- Aftermath suggests cosmic horror persists (entity remains, but sleeping)

## Safety in Horror Games {#safety-in-horror-games}

Horror requires explicit safety tools and ongoing calibration. What terrifies one player traumatizes
another. Establish boundaries, check in frequently, and prioritize player well-being over narrative
effect.

### Pre-Game Safety

Discuss boundaries in Session Zero before introducing horror content. Cover specific content areas,
general discomfort, and exit procedures.

Session Zero horror checklist:

- Lines and veils (content to exclude vs content to keep offscreen)
- Specific phobias or trauma triggers
- Preferred horror subtypes (psychological vs gore vs cosmic)
- Comfort with PC death or permanent consequences
- Exit procedures (breaks, session end, campaign exit)

GM usage:

- Provide content questionnaire before Session Zero
- Discuss boundaries privately if needed
- Document lines and veils for reference
- Revisit boundaries if campaign escalates

### Safety Tools at the Table

Use established safety tools and adapt them to your table's needs. Make them accessible and
normalize their use.

Recommended tools:

- X-Card: Any player can tap out of content without explanation
- Open Door: Players can leave and return without judgment
- Script Change: Players can rewind, fast-forward, or pause scenes
- Check-In: Regular calibration questions during and after sessions

GM usage:

- Introduce tools explicitly; demonstrate use
- Use them yourself to normalize
- Respect tool use immediately without requiring explanation
- Follow up privately if patterns emerge

### Aftercare

Horror sessions can leave residual tension. Provide transition back to normalcy through debrief,
tone shift, and emotional check-in.

Aftercare practices:

- End sessions 15 minutes early for debrief
- Shift tone with casual conversation or comedy
- Offer stars and wishes (highlights and concerns)
- Check in individually with players who seemed affected

GM usage:

- Build aftercare time into session schedule
- Normalize emotional response to horror content
- Adjust intensity if aftercare becomes consistently needed
- Offer campaign breaks or tone shifts if burnout appears

### Adjusting Horror Intensity

Horror tolerance varies by player and changes over time. Calibrate intensity through observation,
check-ins, and willingness to adjust.

Calibration signals:

- Player disengagement or distraction during horror scenes
- Requests for breaks or topic changes
- Reduced roleplay or mechanical engagement
- Post-session comments about discomfort

Intensity adjustments:

- Reduce descriptive detail; focus on mechanical effects
- Shift from personal to cosmic horror (or reverse)
- Introduce more relief scenes and victories
- Pause horror arc for palette cleanser episodes

GM usage:

- Observe player engagement, not just stated comfort
- Adjust proactively when patterns emerge
- Discuss changes privately if individual adjustment needed
- Remember: good horror requires trust, not endurance

## Worked Example: Haunted House Investigation {#worked-example-haunted-house-investigation}

This example demonstrates horror pacing, mystery integration, and stress mechanics in a
single-session investigation.

### Scenario Setup

The PCs investigate a manor house where the owner, Lord Ashford, has locked himself in his study for
three days. His servants are too frightened to enter. The house has a history of tragedy: Ashford's
wife drowned in the estate pond five years ago.

Horror elements:

- Personal horror: The house reflects Ashford's grief and guilt
- Mystery: What happened to Lady Ashford, and what's happening now?
- Stress: Investigation reveals both supernatural threat and human tragedy

Arc structure:

1. Arrival and investigation (dread building)
2. Discovery and escalation (first shock)
3. Confrontation and choice (crisis)
4. Resolution and aftermath (ambiguous ending)

### Scene 1: Arrival

Frame: The PCs arrive at dusk. The house is dark except for candlelight in the upper study window.
The servants wait outside, refusing to enter.

Atmosphere cues:

- "The pond is perfectly still. No insects, no ripples."
- "The servants won't meet your eyes when you ask what they heard."
- "The front door is unlocked. It swings open before you touch it."

Investigation prompts:

- Question servants (Success reveals: wet footprints appear and vanish; whispers from empty rooms)
- Examine the pond (Partial reveals: something large beneath the surface; plants grow in spiral
  patterns)
- Enter the house (automatic; door closes behind them)

Stress clock introduced: 4-segment "Breaking Point" clock for the house investigation.

Advance stress clock (1 segment): Upon entering. "The air pressure changes. Your ears pop."

### Scene 2: Investigation

The PCs explore the ground floor. Evidence suggests someone has been moving through the house, but
not Lord Ashford.

Clues (three routes to each):

Core clue 1: Lady Ashford died during a ritual, not by drowning.

- Library: Partial reveals diary entry about "binding ceremony"
- Drawing room: Success reveals ritual circle hidden under rug
- Servants' testimony: Success reveals she went to pond "prepared"

Core clue 2: Lord Ashford completed the ritual three days ago.

- Study door (locked): Failed force check reveals fresh scratches on inside
- Kitchen: Success reveals ingredients for ritual (salt, iron, sage) recently used
- Ashford's bedroom: Partial reveals he hasn't slept here in weeks

Core clue 3: The ritual bound Lady Ashford's spirit to the house, but something went wrong.

- Ritual circle: Success reveals inverted symbols (binding became imprisonment)
- Pond examination: Critical reveals her body never recovered
- Study door whispers: Partial reveals two voices arguing (Ashford and another)

Stress advances:

- Advance clock (2 segments): When wet footprints appear and lead toward the study
- Advance clock (3 segments): When whispers start calling PC names

Shock moment: A figure appears in a mirror. It's Lady Ashford, and she gestures toward the study.
When PCs turn, she's behind them. Stress clock fills (4 segments).

### Scene 3: Breaking Point

The stress clock fills. Each PC faces a breaking point choice:

- Confront: Approach Lady Ashford and demand answers
- Flee: Leave the house and report failure
- Deny: Insist this is delusion and force the study door
- Break: Accept the horror and ask how to help

Example resolution (Confront):

PC approaches Lady Ashford. She speaks: "He won't let me go. I won't let him forget."

This reveals core truth: Ashford bound her out of guilt, and she's trapped between wanting peace and
wanting him to suffer. The PCs can now choose sides.

### Scene 4: Confrontation

The PCs force the study door (or Lady Ashford opens it). Inside, Lord Ashford maintains the ritual,
believing he's protecting her. He's gaunt, exhausted, and convinced letting go means accepting her
death.

Confrontation options:

- Convince Ashford to release her (opposed social check)
- Break the ritual by force (combat against manifestations)
- Bargain with Lady Ashford (negotiation with supernatural stakes)
- Discover compromise (investigation to find modified ritual)

Mechanical stakes: Whichever approach succeeds, someone pays a cost:

- Ashford's release means accepting her death (he may not survive grief)
- Forced break traps her spirit elsewhere (pond, PCs, or dispersed)
- Bargain requires PC to carry part of her binding (condition: Haunted)
- Compromise requires sacrifice (bond, memory, or time)

Resolution: The PCs choose their approach and make the check. Success releases Lady Ashford. Partial
releases her but with consequences. Failure traps everyone until they find another way.

Example outcome (Partial on social check):

Lady Ashford is released, but Ashford dies of exhaustion as the ritual breaks. She manifests one
final time to thank the PCs and warn: "Some bindings can't be undone. Only transferred." One PC
gains condition Haunted (minor): "You sometimes see her reflection in still water."

### Aftermath

The PCs leave the house. The servants report the candle in the study has gone out. The pond is
still, but now it reflects the stars.

Ambiguous elements preserved:

- Did Lady Ashford find peace, or just new imprisonment?
- Was Ashford's love genuine, or was the binding selfish?
- What did she mean by "some bindings can't be undone"?

GM usage:

- Use this as a one-shot or introduce Haunted condition as arc hook
- If continuing, Lady Ashford's warning foreshadows larger ritual network
- Stress clock resets, but PCs remember this breaking point in future horror scenes
- Adjust resolution based on player choices; preserve some mystery
