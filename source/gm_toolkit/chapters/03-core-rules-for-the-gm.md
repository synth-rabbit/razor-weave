## When to Roll {#when-to-roll}

Roll only when both are true:

- Uncertainty exists (the outcome could plausibly go multiple ways)
- Stakes are present (something changes on Full/Partial/Fail)

Do not roll when a competent character succeeds with time and no pressure in
the way (call it a success and move on). If failure would stall the game, add a
cost and let play continue (fail‑forward).

## Calling for Checks {#calling-for-checks}

Clarify three things out loud before dice:

- Intent: what the player wants to accomplish
- Approach: how they do it (which suggests tools/skills)
- Tool: the skill/proficiency or contest involved

Then pick a DC from the fiction (see ladder below) and pre‑state what
Full/Partial/Fail mean here. If needed, ask a question to expose leverage:
“What are you risking?” or “How do you create an opening first?”

## DC Ladder & Outcome Tiers {#dc-ladder--outcome-tiers}

DC cues (choose what the fiction suggests)

- 12 Easy: safe, aided, trivial with time
- 14 Routine: standard challenge, normal tools
- 16 Tough: notable risk, bad angle, poor tools
- 18 Hard: steep odds, strong opposition, tight window
- 20 Heroic: exceptional, stacked against, slim margin
- 22 Legendary: near impossible without setup or luck

Tiers (translate into fiction)

- Full: objective achieved cleanly; tick progress or gain position
- Partial: progress with cost; fill pre‑stated pressure or apply a tag
- Fail: no progress; escalate danger; reveal a new obstacle or cost
- Crits: amplify change; consider clearing a small tag on crit success

## Advantage/Disadvantage from Fiction {#advantagedisadvantage-from-fiction}

Position first, then numbers. Grant Advantage when approach, tools, or setup
meaningfully help (elevated angle, quiet space, expert tools, ally assist).
Impose Disadvantage when space, time, or attention meaningfully hinder (cramped
footing, loud crowd, bad light, rushed timing). Create advantage by Set Up or
helping; reduce disadvantage by changing space or timing.

## Group Checks & Contests {#group-checks--contests}

Group checks

- Majority: succeed if most do; Partial if split
- All‑Must‑Succeed: use when a single failure breaks the attempt
- Leader‑with‑Help: leader rolls; up to +2 aid dice from helpers

Contests

- Both sides roll; higher total wins; ties are Partial by default
- Pre‑state what Full/Partial/Fail mean for each side

## Turning Results into State {#turning-results-into-state}

Always update visible state. Prefer state changes that the table can feel now:

- Tags: environmental or situational changes (Dim, Fragile Cover, Exposed)
- Conditions: character states with clear clears (Exhausted, Restrained)
- Clocks: paired progress/pressure to pace scenes (sizes 4/6/8)

Patterns

- On Full: tick progress; clear or reduce a minor tag on a crit
- On Partial: tick pre‑stated pressure; add a tag or impose a minor condition
- On Fail: no progress; escalate pressure; reveal a new obstacle

GM usage

- Say what changed and point to it on the table
- Offer a meaningful follow‑up choice that uses or flips the new state
