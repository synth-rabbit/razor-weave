## Social Conflict Fundamentals {#social-conflict-fundamentals}

Social conflict is narrative conflict using words, influence, and leverage instead of violence.
Players negotiate deals, persuade adversaries, manipulate rivals, or build reputations. Social
conflict creates drama and stakes without combat.

Three elements define social conflict:

1. **Goals**: What each side wants. Clear goals create stakes and shape negotiation.
2. **Leverage**: What each side can offer or threaten. Leverage is currency in social conflict.
3. **Costs**: What each side is willing to pay. Costs create tension and hard choices.

Social conflict is not about forcing outcomes. NPCs have agency. Players cannot simply roll high and
make NPCs do anything. Instead, players use leverage, manage costs, and negotiate outcomes. Success
means achieving goals through influence, not domination.

### Goals and Stakes {#goals-and-stakes}

Every social conflict begins with goals. Players want something; NPCs want something. Stakes are
what changes based on outcomes.

**Player Goals** (Examples):

- Gain information (NPC reveals a secret).
- Secure cooperation (NPC agrees to help).
- Avoid conflict (NPC does not attack or report them).
- Gain resources (NPC provides goods, money, or access).

**NPC Goals** (Examples):

- Protect secrets (refuse to reveal information).
- Demand payment or favors (cooperation has a price).
- Maintain authority (will not be intimidated or manipulated).
- Advance personal agenda (uses interaction to further own goals).

**Stakes**: What happens if players succeed or fail? If players persuade the merchant, they gain
critical supplies. If they fail, they must find another source or pay exorbitant prices. Stakes make
social conflict matter.

GM usage:

- Establish clear goals for players and NPCs at the start of social conflict
- Define stakes: what changes based on outcomes
- Ensure NPCs have goals and agency; they are not passive obstacles
- Frame social conflict as negotiation, not domination
- Use leverage and costs to create tension and hard choices

## Leverage and Pressure {#leverage-and-pressure}

**Leverage** is anything that influences an NPC: information, resources, threats, promises,
reputation, relationships. Leverage gives players (and NPCs) tools to achieve goals.

### Types of Leverage {#types-of-leverage}

**Positive Leverage** (Incentives):

- **Offers**: Money, goods, services, alliances.
- **Promises**: Future rewards, favors owed, oaths of loyalty.
- **Shared Goals**: Appeals to mutual interests or common enemies.
- **Reputation**: Fame, heroism, or respected status that grants credibility.

**Negative Leverage** (Threats):

- **Blackmail**: Secrets or scandals that can be revealed.
- **Threats**: Harm, exposure, or loss (physical, social, economic).
- **Withdrawal**: Removing support, abandoning alliances, or leaving the NPC vulnerable.

**Neutral Leverage** (Information and Access):

- **Information**: Secrets, clues, or knowledge the NPC wants.
- **Access**: Introductions to important people, entry to restricted places, or resources only
  players can provide.

### Using Leverage {#using-leverage}

Players declare leverage when negotiating. "I offer 100 gold" (positive leverage). "I know your
secret; cooperate or I reveal it" (negative leverage). "I can introduce you to the Duke" (access
leverage).

GMs determine if leverage is effective based on NPC goals, personality, and fictional positioning.

**Effective Leverage**:

- Aligns with NPC goals or fears.
- Is credible (players can actually deliver or enact).
- Has weight (offers something significant or threatens something important).

**Ineffective Leverage**:

- Contradicts NPC goals or personality.
- Is not credible (empty threats, impossible promises).
- Has no weight (trivial offers or threats).

**Example**: Players try to bribe a loyal knight to betray their lord. The knight values honor and
loyalty above gold. The bribe is ineffective leverage. However, if players reveal the lord is
corrupt (information leverage aligned with the knight's values), the knight reconsiders.

### Pressure {#pressure}

**Pressure** is accumulated leverage or urgency that forces decisions. Pressure can be mechanical
(clocks, conditions) or narrative (time limits, escalating stakes).

**Pressure Clocks**: Track rising tension in social conflict. Example: A "Suspicion Grows" clock
advances as players press the NPC. When it fills, the NPC refuses further negotiation or calls for
guards.

**Pressure Conditions**: Social conditions like *Cornered*, *Defensive*, or *Enraged* represent NPC
states under pressure. Conditions affect NPC responses: a *Cornered* NPC might lash out or make
desperate concessions.

GM usage:

- Identify what leverage players have (information, resources, reputation, threats)
- Determine leverage effectiveness based on NPC goals and personality
- Use leverage to create offers, threats, or incentives
- Track pressure with clocks or conditions to represent rising tension
- Let NPCs use leverage against players; social conflict is two-sided

## Negotiation Structures {#negotiation-structures}

Negotiations range from simple (single check) to complex (multi-stage with leverage, costs, and
outcomes). Choose structure based on importance and table interest.

### Simple Negotiations {#simple-negotiations}

**Simple negotiations** resolve in one or two checks. Use for minor interactions or when time is
limited.

**Procedure**:

1. **Establish Goals**: What does each side want?
2. **Declare Leverage**: What is the player offering, threatening, or appealing to?
3. **Check**: Player rolls relevant skill (Influence, Deception, Insight, etc.).
4. **Outcome**:
   - **Full Success**: Player achieves goal; NPC cooperates fully.
   - **Partial Success**: Player achieves goal with cost (favor owed, information revealed, time
     lost, partial cooperation).
   - **Failure**: Player does not achieve goal; NPC refuses or demands something the player cannot
     pay.

**Example**: Players ask a bartender for information about a suspect. The bartender wants money
(goal: profit). Players offer 10 gold (leverage). Roll Influence. Success: The bartender provides
detailed information. Partial: The bartender provides vague information but hints they know more if
players return with more gold. Failure: The bartender refuses; they are too afraid to talk
(revealing their fear of the suspect).

### Complex Negotiations {#complex-negotiations}

**Complex negotiations** involve multiple stages, leverage exchanges, and escalating stakes. Use for
critical interactions or high-stakes social conflict.

**Procedure**:

1. **Establish Goals and Leverage**: Both sides state goals and available leverage.
2. **Negotiation Phases**: The negotiation proceeds in phases. Each phase involves offers,
   counter-offers, checks, and leverage exchanges.
3. **Leverage Spending**: Players and NPCs spend leverage to gain advantage or apply pressure.
   Leverage is finite; once spent, it is gone.
4. **Outcome Tiers**: Each check advances negotiation or introduces complications.
5. **Resolution**: Negotiation resolves when one side achieves goals, both sides compromise, or
   negotiation breaks down.

**Example Structure** (Three Phases):

#### Phase 1: Opening Offers

- Players and NPC state initial positions.
- Players declare leverage (offer, threat, appeal).
- Roll Influence or relevant skill.
- Outcome determines NPC response: interested, skeptical, or hostile.

#### Phase 2: Counter-Offers and Pressure

- NPC makes counter-offer or demands concession.
- Players adjust leverage, spend new resources, or apply pressure.
- Roll again.
- Outcome: progress toward agreement or escalation.

#### Phase 3: Closing

- Final offers and commitments.
- Roll to seal the deal.
- Outcome: agreement reached, compromise, or breakdown.

**Tracking**: Use a clock (e.g., "Negotiation Progress" 6 segments) to track progress. Successful
checks advance the clock. When it fills, agreement is reached. Use pressure clocks (e.g., "Patience
Wears Thin" 4 segments) to track NPC frustration. If it fills before agreement, negotiation fails.

### Multi-Party Negotiations {#multi-party-negotiations}

**Multi-party negotiations** involve three or more factions with conflicting goals. Players must
manage competing interests and build coalitions.

**Procedure**:

1. **Map Interests**: Identify each faction's goals and leverage.
2. **Choose Approach**: Players negotiate with factions individually, build coalitions, or mediate
   conflicts.
3. **Track Faction Clocks**: Each faction has a "Support" or "Opposition" clock. Players advance
   support clocks with successful negotiations or by addressing faction concerns.
4. **Resolution**: Negotiation succeeds when enough factions support the player's goal (majority or
   unanimous, depending on stakes).

**Example**: Players negotiate a peace treaty between three factions: the Crown, the Rebels, and the
Merchants. Each faction has demands (Crown wants order restored, Rebels want reforms, Merchants want
trade protections). Players must satisfy enough demands to gain majority support.

GM usage:

- Use simple negotiations for minor interactions or time efficiency
- Use complex negotiations for critical, high-stakes interactions
- Track progress and pressure with clocks
- Use multi-party negotiations for political or factional conflicts
- Let negotiations fail if leverage is insufficient or NPCs are intractable; failure creates new
  story directions

## Social Combat {#social-combat}

**Social combat** is structured, turn-based social conflict. It uses mechanics similar to physical
combat but focuses on influence, arguments, and psychological pressure. Use social combat for
intense, dramatic confrontations where every word matters.

### When to Use Social Combat {#when-to-use-social-combat}

Use social combat when:

- The confrontation is climactic (courtroom drama, public debate, critical negotiation).
- Both sides are evenly matched in influence or leverage.
- Failure has serious consequences (reputation destroyed, war declared, alliance broken).
- The table enjoys structured, tactical social interaction.

**Do not use social combat** for casual conversations, minor negotiations, or when quick resolution
is needed.

### Social Combat Structure {#social-combat-structure}

Social combat follows a turn-based structure.

**Setup**:

1. **Establish Stakes**: What happens if players win? If they lose?
2. **Determine Participants**: Who is involved? (Players, primary NPC, audience, allies.)
3. **Set Initiative**: Roll initiative (use Influence, Insight, or Awareness).
4. **Define Social Hit Points**: Each side has a "Composure" or "Resolve" pool representing their
   psychological resilience. This can be abstract (e.g., 3 hits to win) or tied to stats (e.g.,
   Resolve = Influence skill + Social tags).

**Turns**:

On each participant's turn, they take a social action:

- **Persuade**: Roll Influence to sway opinion or gain advantage. Success reduces opponent's
  Resolve.
- **Deceive**: Roll Deception to mislead or create doubt. Success creates openings or disrupts
  opponent's arguments.
- **Intimidate**: Roll Presence or relevant skill to threaten or pressure. Success reduces Resolve
  or imposes social conditions (Rattled, Defensive).
- **Insight**: Roll Insight to read opponent, predict their arguments, or uncover weaknesses.
  Success grants advantage on next action.
- **Defend**: No roll; gain temporary Resolve or remove a social condition.

**Leverage in Social Combat**: Spend leverage to gain advantage on rolls (bonus die, reroll) or
impose disadvantage on opponents.

**Social Conditions**: Social combat can impose conditions:

- **Rattled**: Disadvantage on Influence checks; credibility shaken.
- **Defensive**: Must succeed on Insight check to take offensive actions; on the back foot.
- **Exposed**: Opponent has advantage against you; weakness revealed.
- **Humiliated**: Lose remaining Resolve at the end of your next turn unless you recover; public
  credibility destroyed.

**Resolution**:

- **Victory**: Reduce opponent's Resolve to zero. You achieve your goal (persuade the crowd,
  discredit the rival, gain the judge's favor).
- **Defeat**: Your Resolve is reduced to zero. Opponent achieves their goal (you are discredited,
  judged guilty, or forced to concede).
- **Compromise**: Both sides retain some Resolve but negotiate a middle ground. Partial victory for
  both.

**Example Social Combat**:

Players (acting as defense attorneys) face a prosecutor in a courtroom drama. Stakes: The
defendant's freedom. Each side has Resolve 5. Players roll initiative, then take turns making
arguments (Persuade checks), presenting evidence (Insight to find contradictions), or
cross-examining witnesses (Deceive to create doubt). The prosecutor counters with their own
arguments and evidence. The first side to reduce the other's Resolve to zero wins the case.

### Audiences and Observers {#audiences-and-observers}

Social combat often has audiences (crowds, judges, councils). Audiences affect outcomes.

**Audience Influence**:

- Successful social actions may sway the audience. Track audience favor with a clock or scale (e.g.,
  "Crowd Favor" 6 segments; advance toward players or opponent based on performance).
- When audience favor is won, the audience provides bonuses (advantage on rolls) or penalties to the
  opposition.
- In some cases, winning audience favor is the victory condition, not reducing opponent's Resolve.

**Example**: Players debate a rival in a public forum. The goal is to sway the crowd. Each
successful Persuade check advances the "Crowd Favor" clock toward the players. If the clock fills,
the crowd supports the players and the rival is discredited.

GM usage:

- Use social combat for climactic, high-stakes confrontations
- Define Resolve pools and social actions clearly
- Use leverage to grant advantages or impose disadvantages
- Impose social conditions to create dynamic, tactical play
- Include audiences to add complexity and stakes
- Ensure failure and victory have narrative consequences

## Reputation and Influence Systems {#reputation-and-influence-systems}

Reputation and influence track characters' social standing and ability to affect the world.
Reputation systems add depth to social campaigns.

### Reputation Tracks {#reputation-tracks}

**Reputation** represents how factions, groups, or regions view the party. Reputations can be
positive (Respected, Renowned) or negative (Notorious, Distrusted).

**Tracking Reputation**:

- Use clocks or scales for each major faction or region.
- Actions advance or reduce reputation clocks.
- Reputation levels grant benefits (access, allies, discounts) or costs (hostility, suspicion,
  higher prices).

**Example Reputation Levels** (with a faction):

- **Unknown** (0 segments): The faction does not know you.
- **Aware** (2 segments): The faction knows of you but has no strong opinion.
- **Respected** (4 segments): The faction trusts you; you gain minor favors and cooperation.
- **Renowned** (6 segments): The faction reveres you; you gain significant support, resources, or
  political weight.

Negative reputation works similarly but imposes penalties.

**Gaining Reputation**:

- Complete missions for the faction.
- Publicly perform heroic deeds aligned with faction values.
- Defeat faction enemies or threats.

**Losing Reputation**:

- Betray the faction or break agreements.
- Commit acts opposed to faction values.
- Fail critical missions or cause harm to faction interests.

### Influence Systems {#influence-systems}

**Influence** measures a character's ability to affect social situations. Influence can be tied to
reputation, resources, or personal traits.

**Influence as Resource**:

- Characters have an "Influence" pool (e.g., 3-6 points).
- Spend Influence to gain social advantages: call in favors, sway NPCs without checks, access
  restricted areas, or reduce costs in negotiations.
- Influence regenerates slowly (e.g., 1 point per session or after significant social victories).

**Influence as Clout**:

- Characters with high Influence can affect factions, politics, or public opinion.
- Influence checks determine if characters can enact large-scale changes (e.g., "Can I convince the
  council to declare war?" Roll Influence; success means you sway enough councilors).

**Combining Reputation and Influence**:

- High Reputation grants bonus Influence points or advantage on Influence checks.
- Low Reputation imposes penalties or blocks Influence use.

**Example**: A character with "Renowned" reputation in the Merchant's Guild has 5 Influence points.
They spend 2 Influence to secure a meeting with the Guild Master without checks. They still have 3
Influence points for future use.

### Social Tags and Reputation {#social-tags-and-reputation}

Tags tied to reputation or influence create mechanical benefits.

**Examples**:

- **Renowned Hero**: Gain advantage on Influence checks with factions that value heroism.
- **Notorious Criminal**: Disadvantage on social checks with lawful factions but advantage with
  criminal underworld.
- **Trusted by the Crown**: Access royal resources or audiences without checks.
- **Marked for Death**: Certain factions or NPCs attack on sight or refuse interaction.

Tags make reputation tangible and create fictional permissions.

GM usage:

- Use reputation tracks to reflect party standing with factions or regions
- Advance or reduce reputation based on player actions
- Grant benefits or impose penalties based on reputation levels
- Use Influence as a spendable resource for social advantages
- Create social tags tied to reputation or influence
- Let reputation affect access, costs, and NPC attitudes

## Social Tags and Conditions {#social-tags-and-conditions}

Social tags and conditions create narrative and mechanical stakes in social conflict.

### Social Tags {#social-tags}

**Social tags** represent social states, advantages, or vulnerabilities.

**Positive Social Tags**:

- **Well-Liked**: Advantage on Influence checks in this community.
- **Credible Witness**: Others believe your testimony without checks.
- **Connected**: You know people in high places; gain access or information easily.

**Negative Social Tags**:

- **Mistrusted**: Disadvantage on social checks; others doubt your words.
- **Under Scrutiny**: Authorities or rivals are watching; risky actions attract attention.
- **Compromised**: Someone has leverage over you; they can compel actions.

**Using Social Tags**:

- Players create tags through roleplay or successful checks. "I spend time building relationships"
  (create *Well-Liked* tag).
- GMs impose negative tags based on failures or complications. "Your deception is exposed" (gain
  *Mistrusted* tag).
- Tags can be invoked (for advantage) or compelled (for complications).

### Social Conditions {#social-conditions}

**Social conditions** represent psychological or social states affecting characters in social
conflict.

**Examples**:

- **Rattled**: Shaken confidence; disadvantage on Influence checks until recovery.
- **Suspicious**: Others distrust you; social checks are harder (increase DC or impose
  disadvantage).
- **Obligated**: You owe a favor or debt; can be compelled to act.
- **Humiliated**: Public reputation damaged; social standing reduced until you redeem yourself.
- **Charmed**: Influenced by charisma or deception; you trust the source (can be resisted with
  Insight checks).

**Recovery**:

- Social conditions recover through narrative actions: apologizing, fulfilling obligations,
  rebuilding trust, or proving credibility.
- Some conditions recover with time or successful social interactions.

GM usage:

- Create social tags to represent social standing, advantages, or vulnerabilities
- Use tags in social conflict for mechanical advantages or complications
- Impose social conditions based on social conflict outcomes
- Let conditions affect social checks and NPC attitudes
- Recovery requires narrative action, not just rest

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: Simple Negotiation {#example-1-simple-negotiation}

**Setup**: The party needs supplies for a journey. The local merchant, Greta, has the supplies but
is reluctant to part with them. The roads are dangerous, and she is not sure the party will return
to pay later.

**Goals**:

- **Players**: Secure supplies (food, rope, torches) for the journey.
- **Greta**: Ensure payment or get something of equal value.

**Leverage**:

- **Players**: They can offer immediate payment (50 gold), promise to return with a favor (future
  leverage), or intimidate (threaten to take supplies by force, though this risks reputation).
- **Greta**: She can refuse, offer partial supplies, or demand a higher price.

**Negotiation**:

1. **Players Declare Approach**: "We offer 50 gold for the supplies."
2. **GM Determines Effectiveness**: 50 gold is reasonable but Greta is cautious. Roll Influence to
   convince her.
3. **Check**: Player rolls Influence. Result: Partial success.
4. **Outcome**: Greta agrees to provide the supplies but asks for a small favor in return: deliver a
   letter to her sister in the next town. "Do this, and we have a deal."

**Resolution**: Players gain the supplies (goal achieved) but gain a minor obligation (cost). The
negotiation succeeds with a complication, creating a future hook.

### Example 2: Social Combat {#example-2-social-combat}

**Setup**: The party stands trial for trespassing in a restricted area. The prosecutor, a stern
magistrate named Theron, argues they are spies. The party must defend themselves in open court
before a judge and audience (townsfolk).

**Stakes**:

- **Victory**: The party is acquitted and free to continue their mission.
- **Defeat**: The party is imprisoned or exiled.

**Participants**:

- **Players**: Defense (3 party members).
- **Theron** (Prosecutor): NPC opponent with Resolve 5.
- **Judge**: Neutral; decides based on final Resolve and audience favor.
- **Audience**: Townsfolk; tracked with "Crowd Favor" clock (6 segments, starts neutral).

**Setup**:

- Players and Theron both start with Resolve 4.
- Initiative: Players roll Influence; highest goes first.

#### Turn 1 (Player 1): Persuade

- **Action**: Player 1 argues they were investigating a threat to the town (truth). Roll Influence.
  Success.
- **Effect**: Reduce Theron's Resolve by 1 (Resolve 4 → 3). Advance "Crowd Favor" clock by 1 segment
  toward players (crowd is sympathetic).

#### Turn 2 (Theron): Intimidate

- **Action**: Theron questions Player 1's credibility aggressively. Roll Intimidate. Success.
- **Effect**: Impose *Rattled* condition on Player 1 (disadvantage on next check). Advance "Crowd
  Favor" by 1 segment toward Theron (crowd is uncertain).

#### Turn 3 (Player 2): Insight

- **Action**: Player 2 observes Theron, looking for weaknesses. Roll Insight. Success.
- **Effect**: Gain advantage on next social action against Theron (spotted a contradiction in his
  argument).

#### Turn 4 (Player 3): Persuade (with Advantage)

- **Action**: Using Player 2's insight, Player 3 presents evidence (a map showing the restricted
  area is unmarked). Roll Influence with advantage. Success.
- **Effect**: Reduce Theron's Resolve by 2 (critical argument). Theron's Resolve: 3 → 1. Advance
  "Crowd Favor" by 2 segments toward players (crowd is swayed).

#### Turn 5 (Theron): Defend

- **Action**: Theron steadies himself, recovering composure. No roll.
- **Effect**: Remove *Rattled* condition (if he had one); gain +1 Resolve (Resolve: 1 → 2).

#### Turn 6 (Player 1, recovering from Rattled): Persuade

- **Action**: Player 1 appeals to the judge directly, citing the town's safety. Roll Influence (no
  longer disadvantaged). Success.
- **Effect**: Reduce Theron's Resolve by 1 (Resolve: 2 → 1). Advance "Crowd Favor" by 1 segment
  toward players (clock: 5/6 toward players).

#### Turn 7 (Theron): Final Argument (Desperate)

- **Action**: Theron makes a last-ditch argument, questioning the party's motives. Roll Influence.
  Failure.
- **Effect**: No effect on player Resolve. The argument falls flat.

#### Turn 8 (Player 2): Closing Argument

- **Action**: Player 2 delivers a passionate closing statement. Roll Influence. Success.
- **Effect**: Reduce Theron's Resolve by 1 (Resolve: 1 → 0). Advance "Crowd Favor" clock fully (6/6
  toward players).

**Resolution**:

- Theron's Resolve is reduced to zero. The judge, swayed by the players' arguments and the crowd's
  favor, acquits the party.
- **Outcome**: Players are freed. Theron is discredited but not removed (potential future rival).
  The townsfolk view the party favorably (gain *Well-Liked* tag in this town).

### Example 3: Reputation Challenge {#example-3-reputation-challenge}

**Setup**: The party has "Respected" reputation (4 segments) with the Thieves' Guild. They need the
Guild's help to infiltrate a noble's estate, but the Guild Master, Vex, is hesitant. A recent
failure has made the Guild cautious.

**Goals**:

- **Players**: Secure the Guild's support (intel, tools, safe house).
- **Vex**: Protect the Guild's interests; avoid risky operations that could expose them.

**Reputation and Leverage**:

- Players have "Respected" reputation, granting them a starting advantage (Vex will listen).
- Players offer leverage: a cut of the noble's treasure (positive leverage) and information about a
  rival Guild threatening Vex's territory (information leverage).

**Negotiation**:

1. **Opening Offer**: Players present their plan and offer leverage. Roll Influence with advantage
   (due to "Respected" reputation). Success.
   - **Effect**: Vex is interested but cautious. "I need assurance this will not blow back on us."

2. **Counter-Offer**: Players promise to frame the heist as an inside job (the noble's servants)
   rather than Guild activity. Roll Deception to convince Vex the plan is sound. Partial success.
   - **Effect**: Vex agrees to provide intel and tools but not the safe house (partial cooperation).
     "If this goes wrong, the Guild will disavow you."

3. **Final Push**: Players sweeten the deal by offering the information about the rival Guild
   immediately (spending leverage). No roll needed; Vex accepts.
   - **Effect**: Vex agrees to provide the safe house as well. "You have proven yourselves. Do not
     make me regret this."

**Resolution**:

- Players gain full Guild support (intel, tools, safe house).
- Players advance their reputation with the Guild by 1 segment (Respected → 5/6 toward Renowned).
  The successful negotiation builds trust.
- Vex becomes a recurring ally but expects continued cooperation.

**Future Implications**:

- If the heist succeeds, the party's reputation advances further (Renowned). They gain significant
  Guild support in future endeavors.
- If the heist fails and exposes the Guild, their reputation plummets (Respected → Aware or
  Mistrusted). Vex becomes an enemy or demands compensation.
