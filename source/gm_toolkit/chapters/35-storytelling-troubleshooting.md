## Diagnosing Storytelling Problems {#diagnosing-storytelling-problems}

Storytelling problems manifest in observable symptoms but have underlying root causes. Effective
troubleshooting identifies symptoms, diagnoses causes, and addresses roots rather than symptoms.

### Symptom vs Root Cause

Symptoms are what you observe at the table. Root causes are the underlying issues creating symptoms.
Treating symptoms provides temporary relief. Addressing root causes solves problems.

Common symptom-cause relationships:

Symptom: Players are quiet and passive.

Possible causes:

- Unclear stakes (players don't know what matters)
- No clear choices (players don't know what to do)
- Railroading (players feel choices don't matter)
- Spotlight imbalance (some players dominate)
- Real-world fatigue (problem is external)

Symptom: Sessions feel rushed.

Possible causes:

- Too much content planned (pacing issue)
- Players spend time on unexpected elements (interest mismatch)
- Combat takes too long (mechanical issue)
- Lack of time management (session structure issue)

Symptom: Arc isn't resolving.

Possible causes:

- Players don't care about stakes (motivation issue)
- Information is unclear (mystery design flaw)
- Too many complications (overcomplicated plot)
- No clear path forward (structure issue)
- Players pursuing different arc entirely (interest shift)

### Diagnostic Questions

When you notice a problem, ask diagnostic questions to identify root causes.

Engagement diagnostics:

- Are players actively participating, or passive and reactive?
- Do players make proactive choices, or wait for prompts?
- Do players discuss the game between sessions?
- Do players remember details from previous sessions?
- Do players ask questions about the world and NPCs?

Stakes diagnostics:

- Can players articulate what's at risk?
- Do players care about the outcomes?
- Are stakes personal, communal, or abstract?
- Do consequences feel meaningful or arbitrary?

Pacing diagnostics:

- Does the session have energy peaks and valleys, or flatline?
- Do scenes end with clear transitions, or drag?
- Do players seem bored (too slow) or overwhelmed (too fast)?
- Is there balance between pressure and relief?

Agency diagnostics:

- Do players have multiple options for action?
- Do player choices change outcomes?
- Can players fail forward, or do failures stall progress?
- Are players improvising solutions, or following script?

### Diagnostic Process

Use this process to diagnose storytelling problems systematically.

1. Observe symptoms: What specific behaviors or patterns do you notice?
2. Ask yourself diagnostic questions: Which category does this fit?
3. Gather data: Ask players directly (see below)
4. Identify root cause: What underlying issue creates these symptoms?
5. Test hypothesis: Implement small change; observe results
6. Adjust approach: If change helps, continue; if not, reassess

Asking players directly:

Private check-in: "Hey, I've noticed the last few sessions felt slower. Are you still enjoying the
current arc, or should we shift gears?"

Public pulse check: "Quick feedback: Is the pacing working for everyone? Should I slow down, speed
up, or keep going?"

Specific question: "I'm trying to improve mystery design. Did you feel like you had enough
information to investigate, or were you unsure what to do?"

GM usage:

- Don't assume causes; gather information
- Ask players directly when appropriate
- Test changes incrementally
- Give changes time to show effects
- Be willing to be wrong about diagnosis

## Stalled Arcs {#stalled-arcs}

Arcs stall when progress stops or slows to frustration. Players lose direction, motivation, or
interest. Momentum disappears.

### Symptoms of Stalled Arcs

Observable signs:

- Sessions feel aimless; no clear forward movement
- Players debate options endlessly without deciding
- Same information is revisited repeatedly
- Players express frustration: "What are we supposed to do?"
- Attendance drops or players seem distracted
- In-character conversations become circular

### Root Causes

Stalled arcs have identifiable causes:

Unclear stakes:

- Players don't understand what's at risk
- Consequences feel distant or abstract
- Stakes changed without reframing

Information bottleneck:

- Players lack crucial information to proceed
- Clues were missed or misunderstood
- Mystery design has single point of failure

Too many complications:

- Plot has become tangled with subplots
- Every action introduces new problems
- Players feel overwhelmed by options

Player disinterest:

- Arc premise doesn't engage players
- Stakes don't connect to character motivations
- Players want different type of content

Mechanical issue:

- Failed rolls prevented progress
- Players lack capabilities to overcome obstacles
- Resource depletion stalled momentum

### Solutions

Address stalled arcs with targeted interventions:

Restate stakes clearly:

- Open next session with stakes reminder
- Have NPC articulate what's at risk
- Show consequences of inaction (advance pressure clock)
- Make stakes immediate and personal

Example: "The village elder pulls you aside: 'The children are getting sicker. If you can't find the
source by tomorrow, we're evacuating and burning everything. Please, you're our only hope.'"

Provide information infusion:

- Introduce NPC who volunteers key information
- Let players find crucial clue automatically
- Provide revelation through dream, vision, or intercepted message
- Use failure with information: "You don't pick the lock, but you hear voices inside discussing the
  ritual"

Example: "A bloodied messenger staggers into camp. Before dying, she gasps: 'The poison... it's in
the well... the baron knew...' She presses a sealed letter into your hands."

Simplify complications:

- Resolve or eliminate subplots
- Consolidate multiple threats into one
- Provide clear "next step" options
- Cut through tangle with dramatic event

Example: "While you debate, an explosion rocks the city. The warehouse district is ablaze. You see
figures fleeing toward the docks. The decision is made for you: pursue now or lose them forever."

Pivot the arc:

- Ask players directly: "Is this arc still interesting, or should we shift?"
- Offer explicit choice to redirect or end arc
- Introduce new element that changes everything
- Fast-forward to climax if middle is stalling

Example: "Let's jump forward two weeks. You've gathered information. The ritual is tonight. You're
at the site, ready to act. What's your plan?"

Re-engage player interest:

- Connect arc to character flags and bonds
- Introduce personal stakes for each PC
- Add genre elements players enjoy
- Shift tone or intensity

Example: "As you investigate, you find a letter addressed to [PC]. It's from their missing mentor:
'If you're reading this, I've failed. The conspiracy goes deeper than I imagined. Trust no one in
authority.'"

GM usage:

- Act decisively when arc stalls; waiting worsens problems
- Don't punish players for stalling; provide off-ramps
- Be willing to abandon arc if players aren't engaged
- Learn from stalls to improve future arc design

## Player Disengagement {#player-disengagement}

Player disengagement appears as reduced participation, attention, or investment. It can affect
individual players or the whole table.

### Symptoms of Disengagement

Observable signs:

- Player is quiet, doesn't volunteer actions
- Player is distracted by phone, computer, or side conversations
- Player makes mechanical choices but minimal roleplay
- Player misses sessions or arrives late frequently
- Player seems relieved when session ends early
- Player's characters make passive or self-sabotaging choices

### Root Causes

Disengagement has many possible causes:

Spotlight imbalance:

- Player doesn't get enough focus or agency
- Other players dominate scenes and decisions
- Player's character isn't relevant to current arc

Content mismatch:

- Current content doesn't match player's interests
- Player wants different genre, tone, or play style
- Player's character concept doesn't fit campaign

Mechanical issues:

- Player is confused by rules
- Player's character feels weak or ineffective
- Combat or challenges are too easy or too hard

Social issues:

- Player has conflict with another player
- Player feels judged or dismissed
- Player is uncomfortable with content or tone

External factors:

- Real-life stress affects engagement
- Scheduling conflicts cause missed sessions
- Player is burned out on RPGs generally

### Solutions

Address disengagement with empathy and direct communication:

Private conversation:

Always start with private check-in. Never assume causes publicly.

"Hey, I've noticed you've seemed less engaged lately. Is everything okay? Is there something about
the game I can adjust, or is it external stuff?"

Listen without defensiveness. Players often won't share if they feel they'll be argued with.

Spotlight redistribution:

If imbalance is the cause:

- Open next session with scene featuring disengaged player
- Create arc hooks tied to their character flags
- Ask them directly: "What would you like your character to do?"
- Rotate spotlight systematically during scenes

Example: "Let's start with you. As the party rests, you notice signs of your homeland's culture.
What do you do?"

Content adjustment:

If content mismatch is the cause:

- Discuss preferred content types privately
- Adjust upcoming arcs to include their interests
- Provide side-session or sub-arc focused on their character
- Consider whether player and campaign are compatible

Example: "I know you prefer social intrigue over combat. The next arc will focus on court politics.
Want to help design it?"

Mechanical support:

If mechanical issues are the cause:

- Offer rules clarification and handouts
- Adjust character to be more effective
- Provide magic item or ability that addresses gaps
- Simplify mechanics if system is overwhelming

Example: "Your character's toolkit seems limited. Let's add a versatile magic item that gives you
more options."

Address social issues:

If social conflict is the cause:

- Mediate conflict privately between players
- Reinforce table social contract
- Remove problematic player if necessary
- Provide content warnings for uncomfortable topics

Example: "I've noticed tension between you two. Can we talk about it and find a solution?"

Respect external factors:

If external causes:

- Offer reduced commitment or hiatus
- Express support without pressure
- Invite player back when ready
- Don't take it personally

Example: "I know work is intense right now. No pressure to attend. When things settle, you're always
welcome back."

GM usage:

- Address disengagement early; don't let it fester
- Always have private conversation first
- Respect player agency; they can choose to disengage
- Sometimes players need to leave campaign; that's okay

## Tonal Mismatches {#tonal-mismatches}

Tonal mismatches occur when expected tone and delivered tone diverge. Players expect one experience
but receive another.

### Symptoms of Tonal Mismatch

Observable signs:

- Players seem confused by content
- Jokes or serious moments land awkwardly
- Players comment: "I thought this was [X type] of game"
- GM and players have different energy levels
- Content feels jarring or inconsistent
- Players disengage during certain scene types

### Root Causes

Tonal mismatches arise from:

Session Zero failure:

- Tone wasn't discussed or agreed upon
- Expectations weren't aligned
- Different players want different tones

Genre drift:

- Campaign started one way, shifted over time
- GM or players introduced elements from other genres
- No one noticed gradual shift

Inconsistent delivery:

- GM alternates between tones without signaling
- Players don't match tone with roleplay
- Some players want comedy, others want drama

Content surprise:

- Unexpected dark content in light campaign
- Unexpected silly content in serious campaign
- Horror in action campaign, or vice versa

### Solutions

Recalibrate tone through explicit discussion and adjustment:

Explicit tone discussion:

Address mismatch directly in or out of game:

"I think we have some tone mismatch. I've been running this as serious dark fantasy, but I'm getting
the sense some of you want lighter heroic adventure. Can we talk about what tone we all want?"

Discuss openly:

- What tone did players expect?
- What tone is GM delivering?
- What tone do we want going forward?
- Can we compromise, or is split irreconcilable?

Re-establish tone:

After discussion, reaffirm agreed tone:

- Update Session Zero notes with tone description
- Provide genre examples (books, films, games)
- Describe what tone includes and excludes
- Check in regularly to ensure tone maintains

Example tone statement: "We're going for earnest heroic fantasy with occasional dark moments. Think
Lord of the Rings: serious stakes, real danger, but ultimately hopeful. Not grimdark, not parody."

Signal tone shifts:

If campaign includes multiple tones, signal shifts:

- Announce tone changes: "This next scene is comedic relief"
- Use different music or lighting for different tones
- Have in-game framing (tavern scene = lighter, dungeon = serious)
- Let players know when tone will shift so they can adjust

Example: "Okay, we're moving from investigation to action set piece. Expect over-the-top stunts and
one-liners."

Adjust content:

Modify upcoming content to match agreed tone:

- Lighten tone: Add humor NPCs, reduce lethality, increase heroic moments
- Darken tone: Introduce moral complexity, raise stakes, add consequences
- Shift genre: Introduce elements from desired genre
- Remove mismatched elements: Cut content that doesn't fit tone

Respect safety tools:

If tone includes dark content:

- Reaffirm safety tools are available
- Check comfort levels privately
- Adjust intensity based on feedback
- Provide aftercare and tone shifts

GM usage:

- Tone mismatches are fixable with communication
- Don't gaslight players: "You should have known this was dark"
- Be willing to adjust; your fun isn't more important than theirs
- Some mismatches mean player and campaign aren't compatible

## Pacing Failures {#pacing-failures}

Pacing failures make sessions feel too slow, too fast, or uneven. Energy flatlines or spikes
erratically.

### Symptoms of Pacing Failures

Observable signs:

Too slow:

- Players seem bored or distracted
- Scenes drag without clear purpose
- Players check time or mention it's late
- Investigations or travel feel endless
- Players say: "Can we just get to the fight/revelation?"

Too fast:

- Players seem overwhelmed or confused
- Important moments feel rushed
- Players miss information or can't process
- No breathing room between intense scenes
- Players say: "Wait, what just happened?"

Uneven:

- Some scenes are engaging, others drag
- Energy peaks happen too early or too late
- Sessions end on low energy
- Players seem whipsawed by pace changes

### Root Causes

Pacing problems stem from structural issues:

Poor scene economy:

- Too many scenes per session
- Scenes without clear purpose or stakes
- No cuts or time jumps; everything plays in real-time

Mechanical drag:

- Combat takes too long
- Investigation has no forward momentum
- Excessive rule lookups slow play

Wrong focus:

- Emphasis on unimportant elements
- Important moments get short time
- Players interested in different content than GM emphasizes

Pressure imbalance:

- No urgency; players don't feel time pressure
- Constant urgency; no relief or downtime
- Clocks advance too slowly or quickly

### Solutions

Improve pacing through structural and mechanical adjustments:

Scene economy:

Use montage and cuts:

- Montage routine activities: "You spend two days gathering supplies. What's one interesting thing
  that happens?"
- Cut scenes early once outcome is clear: "You convince the guard. Cut to inside the mansion."
- Skip low-stakes travel: "After three days on the road, you arrive at the ruins."

Frame scenes with purpose:

- Open scenes with stakes: "This meeting determines whether the duke will aid you."
- End scenes with transition: "With the information gained, you know where to go next."
- Cut scenes without clear purpose

Accelerate mechanics:

Speed up combat:

- Use timers for player turns (30-60 seconds)
- Pre-roll enemy damage
- Group similar enemies
- Simplify enemy tactics

Speed up investigation:

- Provide core clues automatically or on first attempt
- Use montage for extended investigation
- Set clear information goals: "You need three clues to proceed"

Speed up rules:

- Make rulings and move on; look up later
- Create reference sheets for common mechanics
- Let players handle their own mechanics

Adjust focus:

Emphasize what players care about:

- Observe which scenes have high energy
- Expand content players engage with
- Compress or cut content players ignore
- Ask directly: "What do you want to focus on?"

Example: If players love NPC interaction but drag during dungeon crawls, spend more session time on
social scenes and compress dungeon to montage or single set piece.

Balance pressure and relief:

Create tension curves:

- Follow intense scenes with brief relief
- Build pressure gradually across session
- Place highest stakes scene 2/3 through session
- End with resolution or cliffhanger, not slow fade

Use clocks for urgency:

- Visible countdown creates urgency
- Advance clocks to pressure players
- Pause clocks during relief scenes

Example session structure:

- Opening (15 min): Recap and immediate hook (medium energy)
- Scene 1 (30 min): Investigation or social (building energy)
- Scene 2 (45 min): Complication or combat (high energy)
- Scene 3 (20 min): Downtime or relief (low energy)
- Scene 4 (40 min): Revelation or set piece (highest energy)
- Closing (20 min): Resolution and cliffhanger (medium-high energy)

GM usage:

- Watch player energy; adjust pacing in real-time
- Cut or extend scenes based on engagement
- Use breaks to reset energy
- End sessions on high notes when possible
- Ask players if pacing worked after session

## Spotlight Imbalances {#spotlight-imbalances}

Spotlight imbalance occurs when some players get significantly more attention, agency, or importance
than others.

### Symptoms of Spotlight Imbalance

Observable signs:

- One or two players make most decisions
- Some players rarely speak without prompting
- Character arcs advance unevenly
- Some players' skills are rarely relevant
- Players comment: "I didn't get to do much today"
- Quiet players are disengaged

### Root Causes

Spotlight imbalances arise from:

Player personality:

- Extroverted players naturally dominate
- Introverted players wait for prompts
- Some players are comfortable being passive

Arc design:

- Current arc focuses on one character's background
- Some character concepts are more relevant
- Some skills are more useful than others

GM habits:

- GM defaults to same players for input
- GM follows whoever speaks first
- GM doesn't actively redirect spotlight

Party dynamics:

- Players have established social hierarchy
- Some players defer to others' expertise
- Party has designated "face" or "leader"

### Solutions

Actively manage spotlight through conscious techniques:

Systematic spotlight rotation:

Open scenes with specific players:

- "Let's start with you. What's your character doing while the party rests?"
- Rotate who gets scene-opening focus
- Track who's had spotlight recently

Use initiative for non-combat scenes:

- Go around the table in order for input
- Ask each player one question or prompt
- Ensure everyone contributes before revisiting same player

Flag-based spotlights:

Create arcs hooks for each character:

- Ensure each arc has personal hooks for multiple PCs
- Introduce NPCs or elements tied to each character's background
- Ask players what spotlight moments they want

Example: "This arc has personal stakes for the wizard. Next arc will focus on the rogue's past."

Skill-based prompts:

Ensure all skills get use:

- Design challenges requiring diverse skills
- Prompt players with relevant skills: "Ranger, what do you notice about these tracks?"
- Let niche skills shine occasionally

Role prompts:

Directly invite participation:

- "We haven't heard from you yet. What does your character think?"
- "You've been quiet. Want to respond to this?"
- In combat: "Your turn" (never skip quiet players)

Delegation:

Give players spotlight through responsibility:

- "You're the diplomat. How do you approach this?"
- "This is your area of expertise. What's the plan?"
- Let players narrate outcomes of their successes

Address dominant players:

If some players dominate, gently redirect:

- "That's a great idea. Let's hear from others before deciding."
- "Hold that thought. I want to check in with everyone."
- Private conversation: "I love your energy, but let's make sure everyone gets chances to
  contribute."

Encourage quiet players:

Support introverted players without forcing:

- Provide opportunities, don't demand performance
- Let players contribute in comfortable ways (in-character vs out-of-character)
- Private check-in: "Would you like more spotlight, or are you happy with current balance?"

Track spotlight:

Keep informal tracking:

- Note who got major scenes each session
- Ensure spotlight rotates over 2-3 session period
- Adjust next session if imbalance appears

GM usage:

- Spotlight management is active work; don't assume it balances
- Different players want different amounts of spotlight
- Ask players their preference
- Balance spotlight across arcs, not necessarily within single session

## Campaign Derailment {#campaign-derailment}

Campaign derailment occurs when players take unexpected directions that invalidate prepared content
or campaign structure.

### Symptoms of Derailment

Observable signs:

- Players pursue goals unrelated to campaign arcs
- Prepared NPCs and locations go unused
- Players make choices that end current arc prematurely
- Party splits permanently or pursues different goals
- Players say: "Why don't we just..." and propose alternative to main plot
- GM feels frustrated that prep is wasted

### Root Causes

Derailment causes:

Player agency:

- Players have better ideas than prepared content
- Players solve problems in unexpected ways
- Players prioritize differently than GM expected

Interest mismatch:

- Players aren't engaged with main arc
- Players want different content type
- Red herrings are more interesting than main plot

Unclear expectations:

- Players don't understand campaign structure
- Players think sandbox but GM planned linear story
- GM wants epic quest but players want slice-of-life

GM railroading attempts:

- Players resist being railroaded
- Players deliberately subvert forced choices
- Players rebel against lack of agency

### Solutions

Embrace, redirect, or reset depending on situation:

Embrace derailment:

If player idea is good:

- Acknowledge: "That's better than what I had planned. Let's do it."
- Adapt prep to new direction
- Let players drive campaign direction
- Reframe prepared content to fit new path

Example: Players want to negotiate with villain instead of fighting. Great! Use combat encounter
location for negotiation scene. Reframe villain's combat tactics as negotiation leverage.

Redirect gently:

If you need time to adapt:

- Introduce complication that buys session: "That's interesting. Before you can do that, X happens."
- Use NPC to provide information: "The wizard warns that approach has risks you haven't considered."
- Present choice explicitly: "You can pursue that, but it means abandoning the current arc. Is that
  what you want?"

Example: "You can sail to the distant continent, but the journey takes months and the kingdom's
crisis can't wait. Do you want to resolve this arc first, or let the kingdom fall while you
explore?"

Use prepared content flexibly:

Repurpose prep for new direction:

- NPCs can fill different roles
- Locations can be reached by different paths
- Encounters can be reskinned for new contexts
- Clues can point to player-chosen goals

Example: Prepared dungeon for main quest? Players want to chase subplot. Dungeon now contains
subplot clues instead.

Explicit conversation:

If derailment indicates deeper issue:

- Stop game and discuss: "I'm noticing we're going a very different direction. Let's talk about what
  campaign we're playing."
- Ask what players want: "What are you most interested in?"
- Explain campaign intent: "I designed this as epic quest. Is that still interesting?"
- Negotiate: "Can we complete current arc, then pivot? Or should we shift now?"

Reset if necessary:

If derailment shows fundamental mismatch:

- Acknowledge: "I think we have different ideas about this campaign."
- Options:
  - Start new campaign with aligned expectations
  - Continue with explicit framework change
  - Take break and revisit
- Don't force incompatible campaign to continue

GM usage:

- Derailment isn't player sabotage; it's communication
- Player ideas are often better than prep
- Flexible prep derails less easily
- Some derailment indicates you should follow player lead
- Protect your fun too; unsustainable for GM isn't viable

Ask players these questions periodically:

After session (quick):

- "What was your favorite moment today?"
- "Was pacing too fast, too slow, or just right?"
- "Did you get enough spotlight?"

After arc (detailed):

- "What worked well in this arc?"
- "What didn't work or felt frustrating?"
- "What do you want more or less of going forward?"
- "How's your character feeling? What do they want?"

Mid-campaign (comprehensive):

- "Is the campaign still fun?"
- "Is the tone what you expected and wanted?"
- "Are you getting the type of content you want?"
- "What should I keep doing? What should I change?"
- "How can I make this more fun for you?"

GM usage:

- Schedule regular health checks; don't wait for crisis
- Act on feedback; players stop giving it if ignored
- Thank players for honest feedback
- Share your own concerns when appropriate
- Remember: fixing problems early is easier than salvaging campaigns
