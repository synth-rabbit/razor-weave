## Campaign Framework Types {#campaign-framework-types}

Campaign frameworks are structural approaches that define how narrative, player choice, and GM prep
interact. Each framework emphasizes different play patterns and requires different preparation
styles. Choosing the right framework (or blending multiple frameworks) shapes your campaign's
identity and long-term sustainability.

**Episodic**: Standalone arcs with optional continuity. Each arc resolves independently; players can
miss sessions without losing narrative threads.

**Linear**: GM-authored plot with player-driven pacing. The campaign follows a central storyline,
but players control how and when they engage plot beats.

**Sandbox**: Player-driven exploration with GM-authored locations and factions. Players choose where
to go and what to pursue; the GM prepares reactive content.

**Hexcrawl**: Procedural exploration with emergent narrative. The campaign focuses on discovery and
survival; story arises from exploration rather than authored plot.

**Fronts-Based**: GM-authored threats with player-chosen priorities. Multiple active threats
progress independently; players decide which to address and when.

**Faction-Driven**: Living world with competing interests. Factions pursue goals with or without
player involvement; players navigate and influence factional conflicts.

No framework is superior. Each supports different play styles and group preferences. Many successful
campaigns blend frameworks, using episodic arcs for breathing room between linear plot beats or
combining sandbox exploration with faction-driven politics.

## Episodic Campaigns {#episodic-campaigns}

Episodic campaigns prioritize flexibility and accessibility. Each arc is self-contained with
beginning, middle, and end, though characters, setting, and some plot threads carry forward.

**Strengths**: Easy to add or remove players, forgiving of missed sessions, low continuity burden,
allows genre and tone experimentation.

**Challenges**: Harder to build long-term stakes, requires strong arc-level storytelling, character
arcs may feel fragmented without connective tissue.

**Prep Requirements**: Moderate. Design each arc independently with clear stakes and resolution.
Prepare recurring NPCs and locations to provide continuity without requiring plot memory.

**Session Structure**: Each session advances the current arc. Sessions 1-2 establish the arc's
stakes and give players initial levers. Sessions 3-5 develop complications and escalate tension.
Session 6 (or final session) delivers climax and resolution.

**Continuity**: Track recurring NPCs, character relationships, and setting changes. Each arc should
reference past arcs lightly (callbacks, consequences) without requiring deep knowledge.

**Example**: A mercenary company takes contracts each arc. Arc 1: Escort a caravan through bandit
territory. Arc 2: Investigate disappearances in a mining town. Arc 3: Protect a noble during a
festival. Each arc is standalone, but NPCs recur (the company commander, favored clients) and
character relationships deepen over time.

GM usage:

- Design arcs with clear beginning, middle, and end
- Include recurring NPCs and locations for continuity
- Reference past arcs lightly; avoid requiring deep memory
- Celebrate arc conclusions; treat each resolution as a mini-campaign finale

## Linear Campaigns {#linear-campaigns}

Linear campaigns follow a central storyline with defined beginning, middle, and end. The GM authors
the main plot, but players control pacing, methods, and side diversions.

**Strengths**: Strong narrative momentum, clear long-term goals, emotionally satisfying payoffs,
easier to build thematic coherence.

**Challenges**: Requires consistent attendance, can feel railroaded if player agency is not
prioritized, harder to accommodate unexpected player directions.

**Prep Requirements**: High upfront, moderate ongoing. Outline the campaign's main beats
(introduction, escalation, climax, resolution). Prepare flexible scenes that allow player choice
within the larger structure.

**Session Structure**: Each session advances the main plot or develops characters and themes. Early
sessions establish stakes and introduce the central conflict. Middle sessions escalate complications
and test player plans. Late sessions build toward climax and resolution.

**Player Agency**: Avoid scripting outcomes. Linear structure means the central conflict is
GM-authored, but how players engage that conflict is entirely their choice. Offer multiple paths to
each plot beat.

**Example**: The campaign's central plot: A sorcerer-tyrant seeks to awaken an ancient dragon.
Players learn of the threat (arc 1), gather allies and resources (arc 2-3), confront the tyrant's
lieutenants (arc 4-5), and face the tyrant in a final confrontation (arc 6). Within this structure,
players choose which allies to recruit, which lieutenants to fight first, and how to approach the
finale.

GM usage:

- Outline campaign beats but not specific scenes
- Offer multiple paths to each plot milestone
- Let players set the pace; do not force advancement
- Include side arcs that develop characters or setting without advancing main plot

## Sandbox Campaigns {#sandbox-campaigns}

Sandbox campaigns give players freedom to explore and pursue goals within a GM-authored setting. The
GM prepares locations, NPCs, factions, and hooks, then responds to player choices.

**Strengths**: High player agency, emergent narrative, replayability (different groups explore
different areas), supports varied play styles.

**Challenges**: Requires significant upfront prep, demands GM improvisation, can lack narrative
cohesion without deliberate effort.

**Prep Requirements**: High upfront, low ongoing. Prepare a map with locations, factions, and hooks.
Each location has NPCs, secrets, and potential conflicts. Factions have goals, assets, and clocks.
Players choose where to go; you prepare content reactively.

**Session Structure**: Sessions begin with players choosing a goal or destination. Sessions develop
based on player choices, ending when the immediate goal resolves or a new lever emerges. Use
session-end questions to gauge player interest for next session's prep.

**GM Responsibilities**: Maintain setting consistency, track faction clocks, introduce new hooks
when players exhaust current interests, ensure player choices have visible consequences.

**Example**: The campaign is set in a frontier region with six towns, wilderness areas, and three
active factions (merchant guild, bandit confederation, religious order). Players choose to
investigate rumors of a bandit hideout. You prepare the hideout, its inhabitants, and complications.
After the session, players decide to pursue the merchant guild's offer of work, so you prepare that
content for the next session.

GM usage:

- Prepare locations and factions with goals, not plot
- Offer 3-5 hooks each session; let players choose
- Track faction clocks; advance them based on time passing or player actions
- Use session-end questions to prep reactively

## Hexcrawl Campaigns {#hexcrawl-campaigns}

Hexcrawl campaigns emphasize procedural exploration and survival. The campaign is structured around
a map divided into hexes; players explore hexes, encounter procedural content, and discover emergent
narrative.

**Strengths**: Discovery-focused, low continuity burden, supports drop-in play, generates emergent
stories from exploration.

**Challenges**: Can feel aimless without long-term goals, requires procedural generation systems,
may lack emotional depth without deliberate narrative scaffolding.

**Prep Requirements**: Moderate. Prepare a hex map with terrain types, landmarks, and encounter
tables. Populate some hexes with authored content (ruins, faction strongholds, unique locations).
Use tables for random encounters and discoveries in unpopulated hexes.

**Session Structure**: Sessions follow the exploration loop: travel (hex-by-hex movement, terrain
challenges, random encounters), discover (new locations, NPCs, secrets), decide (rest, continue,
investigate, retreat). Use clocks for resource depletion (supplies, time until winter) to create
urgency.

**Narrative Scaffolding**: Add authored content (lost ruins with mysteries, faction conflicts,
recurring NPCs) to provide narrative threads. Hexcrawls benefit from light overarching goals (find
the lost city, map the region, establish trade routes) that emerge from exploration.

**Example**: The campaign is set in an uncharted wilderness. Players are explorers mapping the
region for a patron. Each session, they travel 2-4 hexes, encountering terrain challenges, wildlife,
ruins, and occasional NPCs. Over time, they discover a pattern: ancient ruins mark a lost
civilization, and a hostile faction is also searching for these ruins. This emergent narrative
becomes a long-term arc.

GM usage:

- Prepare hex maps with terrain and landmarks
- Use encounter tables for procedural content
- Populate key hexes with authored content for narrative hooks
- Track resources (supplies, time) with clocks to create urgency

## Fronts-Based Campaigns {#fronts-based-campaigns}

Fronts-based campaigns (inspired by Apocalypse World and Dungeon World) present multiple active
threats that progress independently. Players choose which threats to address and when; unaddressed
threats escalate.

**Strengths**: Creates urgency and meaningful choice, supports emergent priorities, generates
dynamic world changes, rewards proactive play.

**Challenges**: Requires tracking multiple timelines, can overwhelm players with choices, risks
losing narrative focus if threats are too disparate.

**Prep Requirements**: Moderate. Design 2-4 fronts (threats) with goals, stakes, clocks, and
escalation stages. Each front has a countdown: if players do not intervene, the front progresses
toward catastrophic outcomes.

**Session Structure**: Sessions begin with players choosing which front to address. As players
engage a front, they learn more about it and gain tools to oppose it. Meanwhile, unaddressed fronts
advance their clocks. Use session-end summaries to show which fronts progressed.

**Front Design**: Each front includes a threat (villain, disaster, societal collapse), impending
doom (what happens if the front completes), stakes (who suffers, what is lost), and countdown
(escalation stages as a clock advances).

**Example**: Three fronts: (1) A plague spreads from the slums (doom: city quarantine and mass
death); (2) A noble house plots a coup (doom: civil war); (3) A cult summons a demon (doom: demonic
incursion). Players choose to address the plague first, spending two sessions containing it.
Meanwhile, the coup plot advances (one stage) and the cult advances (two stages). Players must now
choose which escalating threat to tackle next.

GM usage:

- Design 2-4 fronts with clocks and escalation stages
- Advance front clocks when players pursue other goals or time passes
- Show consequences of unaddressed fronts in narration
- Let players choose which fronts to prioritize

## Faction-Driven Campaigns {#faction-driven-campaigns}

Faction-driven campaigns focus on competing groups with conflicting goals. Factions act
independently, pursuing agendas and responding to player actions. Players navigate factional
politics, form alliances, and influence outcomes.

**Strengths**: Creates living world feel, supports political and social play, generates emergent
conflicts and alliances, rewards creative problem-solving.

**Challenges**: Requires tracking multiple factions and relationships, demands improvisation, can
feel overwhelming if factions are too numerous or complex.

**Prep Requirements**: Moderate. Design 3-6 factions with goals, assets, weaknesses, and
relationships. Give each faction a clock tracking progress toward their goals. Track player
reputation with each faction.

**Session Structure**: Sessions involve players interacting with factions (negotiation, espionage,
alliance-building, sabotage). Player actions affect faction clocks and relationships. Between
sessions, advance faction clocks based on time passing or player inaction.

**Faction Dynamics**: Factions form alliances, rivalries, and neutral relationships. Player actions
shift these dynamics. If players help Faction A against Faction B, A's relationship improves and B's
worsens. If players betray A, A becomes hostile.

**Example**: Four factions: Merchant Guild (goal: dominate trade), Thieves' Collective (goal:
control black market), City Guard (goal: maintain order), Religious Order (goal: expand influence).
Players work for the Merchant Guild, sabotaging the Thieves' Collective. The Collective retaliates
by framing the Guild for corruption. The City Guard investigates, and the Religious Order offers to
mediate for a price. Players navigate this web, making alliances and enemies.

GM usage:

- Design 3-6 factions with goals, clocks, and relationships
- Track player reputation with each faction
- Advance faction clocks between sessions
- Show faction actions in narration, even when players are not directly involved

## Blending Frameworks {#blending-frameworks}

Most campaigns benefit from blending frameworks. Use different frameworks for different campaign
phases or combine elements from multiple frameworks simultaneously.

**Episodic + Linear**: Run standalone arcs (episodic) that also advance a long-term plot (linear).
Example: Each arc resolves independently, but clues about the overarching villain emerge gradually
across arcs.

**Sandbox + Faction-Driven**: Combine open exploration (sandbox) with living factions
(faction-driven). Players explore freely, but factions pursue goals that create reactive narrative.
Example: Players explore a region while three factions compete for control; player choices affect
which faction succeeds.

**Fronts + Linear**: Use fronts to create urgency while maintaining a central plot. Example: The
main plot is defeating the sorcerer-tyrant (linear), but multiple fronts (plague, coup, cult)
provide side conflicts and time pressure.

**Hexcrawl + Episodic**: Run procedural exploration (hexcrawl) with authored mini-arcs (episodic) at
discovered locations. Example: Players explore hexes procedurally, but key hexes contain authored
content with 2-3 session arcs.

Blending requires clear communication. Tell players which framework is active and what it means for
their choices. Example: "This arc is episodic; feel free to take risks without worrying about
long-term consequences. Next arc will be more linear and tie into the campaign's main plot."

GM usage:

- Choose 1-2 frameworks to blend; more than two risks confusion
- Communicate framework shifts to players
- Use one framework for structure (episodic, linear) and another for content (sandbox, factions,
  fronts)
- Transition frameworks between arcs, not mid-arc

## Choosing and Transitioning Frameworks {#choosing-and-transitioning-frameworks}

Choose a framework at Session Zero based on group preferences, GM prep capacity, and campaign goals.
Reassess every few arcs and adjust if needed.

**Choosing**: Ask players during Session Zero:

- Do you prefer standalone arcs or long-term plot? (Episodic vs Linear)
- Do you want to explore freely or follow a central story? (Sandbox vs Linear)
- Do you enjoy procedural discovery or authored narrative? (Hexcrawl vs Authored)
- Do you like managing multiple threats or focusing on one? (Fronts vs Linear)
- Do you enjoy political maneuvering and factional play? (Faction-Driven)

Match their answers to frameworks. If preferences conflict, blend frameworks or alternate by arc.

**Transitioning**: Campaigns can transition frameworks between arcs. Example: Start with episodic
arcs to establish characters and setting, then transition to linear for a climactic campaign arc. Or
begin with linear, then shift to sandbox after the main plot resolves, letting players explore the
changed world.

Communicate transitions clearly: "We have finished the main plot. For the next phase, we will shift
to sandbox play. You can explore the regions we have unlocked, pursue personal goals, or investigate
rumors. What interests you?"

**Red Flags**: Reassess if:

- Players feel railroaded (linear framework may need more sandbox elements)
- Players feel aimless (sandbox may need fronts or linear structure)
- Prep is overwhelming (reduce scope, shift to episodic or procedural)
- Players disengage (framework may not match their preferences; check in and adjust)

GM usage:

- Choose framework at Session Zero based on player preferences
- Reassess every 3-4 arcs; adjust if engagement drops
- Communicate framework shifts explicitly
- Use transitions to refresh campaign energy and explore new play styles
