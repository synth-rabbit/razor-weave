## Expansion Plan {#expansion-plan}

- Reframe GM purpose and scope for retail clarity; avoid internal jargon.
- Add 1–2 short vignettes showing a GM decision in play (success/mixed).
- Establish quality bar: fairness, pacing, clarity, and consistency.
- Point to quick references and where to find tools in later chapters.

## How to Use This Book {#how-to-use-this-book}

Deep read once, quick‑reference forever. Start with Gameplay Philosophy and The
Gameplay Loop to absorb the system’s rhythm; then jump to Scene & Encounter
Structure for the procedure you’ll use every session. Combat (GM Guidance)
provides an at‑table flow with micro‑checklists and examples. Mechanics Overview
(GM) summarizes must‑know levers (DCs, tiers, tags/conditions, clocks). Worked
Examples show fully annotated scenes; Quick References compile the most‑used
tables and checklists. Cross‑links point to Player, Storyteller, and Mechanics
books when you need alternate angles or deeper catalogs.

Pointer: For live play, keep
[Quick Reference Sheets](./17-quick-references.md#gm-quick-reference-sheets) open alongside this chapter.
They condense DC cues, tiers, the loop/scene steps, tags/conditions, group
checks/contests, combat actions, and a rulings checklist.

## What This Book Is Not {#what-this-book-is-not}

- Not lore: this is a practical GM guide, not setting fiction.
- Not a rules compendium: technical rules scaffolding was transformed into
  accessible, fiction-first guidance here.
- Not exhaustive catalogs: we link to references instead of duplicating them.

## Audience & Goals {#audience--goals}

Who this serves: (1) New GMs learning this system; (2) Experienced GMs
translating their instincts to these tools. Outcomes: you can frame compelling
scenes in minutes, adjudicate checks confidently, keep tension rising and
falling on purpose, and explain outcomes so players trust the world—even when
the dice complicate things. You’ll also know how to prep efficiently, compose
enemies and threats, and finish sessions with clear momentum for next time.

## Structure of the Guide {#structure-of-the-guide}

- Gameplay Philosophy: the values that shape rulings and pacing.
- The Gameplay Loop: the action→check→outcome→reaction cycle across modes.
- Scene & Encounter Structure: a stepwise procedure with checklists and
  examples.
- Mechanics Overview (GM): DCs, tiers, tags/conditions, clocks—your core
  levers.
- Combat (GM Guidance): order options, action types, terrain/tags, clocks,
  resolve.
- Designing & Running Enemies/Threats: roles, ranks, budgets, counterplay,
  behaviors.
- Worked Examples & Case Studies: annotated walkthroughs across modes.
- Advanced GM Guidance: improvisation, mysteries/politics, tone, table safety.
- Worldbuilding & Prep Tools: usable templates and time‑saving workflows.

## Cross‑Links {#cross-links}

- Player Guide: core concepts for players
- Mechanics Reference: skills, proficiencies, tags, conditions
- Storyteller Guide: narrative structure and campaign planning

## Overview {#overview}

Purpose: set expectations and give GMs immediate confidence. The GM’s mission is
to keep play moving, make stakes visible, apply rules consistently, and turn
every result into story momentum. This guide is practical first: short
procedures, worked examples, and clear tools you can reach for in the moment.
You’ll find pacing techniques that prevent stalls, adjudication patterns that
keep rulings fair, and structure that translates rolls into fiction without
losing vibe or speed. Whether you’re a first‑time GM or a veteran learning this
system, these chapters show how to frame scenes, pick the right checks, use tags
and conditions as levers, and bring pressure or relief through clocks. The core
promise: you always know what happens next and why it feels right.
