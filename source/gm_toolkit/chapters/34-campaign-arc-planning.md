## Arc Planning Fundamentals {#arc-planning-fundamentals}

Campaign arcs are multi-session story structures with setup, development, climax, and resolution.
Good arc planning provides direction without scripting outcomes. The plan is a map, not a railroad.
It guides preparation while allowing player agency to shape the journey.

### What Is a Campaign Arc

A campaign arc is a narrative unit spanning 3-8 sessions with a central conflict or question. It has
a beginning (introduction of stakes), middle (development and complications), and end (climax and
resolution). Arcs connect to form campaigns.

Arc characteristics:

- Central conflict: One primary challenge or question
- Clear stakes: What's at risk and why it matters
- Rising tension: Escalating pressure and complications
- Player-driven pacing: PCs choose when and how to engage
- Meaningful resolution: Outcomes change world or character state

Arc vs session vs campaign:

- Session: Single play session (3-4 hours); completes 2-5 scenes
- Arc: Story unit spanning 3-8 sessions; resolves central conflict
- Campaign: Collection of connected arcs spanning 10-50+ sessions

### Arc Scope and Length

Arc length depends on complexity, player engagement, and campaign pacing. Match scope to available
time and player interest.

Arc length guidelines:

- Short arc (3-4 sessions): Single clear objective; limited complications
- Standard arc (5-6 sessions): Central conflict with 2-3 subplots
- Long arc (7-8 sessions): Complex conflict with multiple approaches and deep development
- Epic arc (9+ sessions): Campaign-defining conflict requiring extensive preparation

Factors affecting arc length:

- Session frequency: Weekly games support longer arcs; monthly games need shorter arcs
- Player engagement: Engaged players sustain longer arcs; new players need shorter arcs
- Complexity: Simple conflicts resolve faster; layered conflicts need development
- Pacing preference: Some tables prefer quick resolution; others enjoy slow burn

GM usage:

- Start with 4-5 session arcs until you learn table pace
- Ask players at arc end: "Was this too long, too short, or just right?"
- Adjust future arcs based on feedback and observed engagement
- Build in flexible sessions that can compress or expand arc

### Flexible Planning

Arc plans are guides, not scripts. Plan structure, not outcomes. Prepare situations, not solutions.
Build pivot points where player choices redirect the arc.

Flexible planning principles:

- Plan inciting incidents, not resolutions: Know how arc starts, not how it ends
- Prepare locations and NPCs, not plot beats: Create resources you can deploy flexibly
- Use clocks for progress: Track state changes, not predetermined events
- Build modular scenes: Prepare scenes that work in multiple orders
- Expect player solutions: Don't plan one path; prepare to improvise around choices

Example rigid planning (avoid):

"Session 1: PCs investigate murder. Session 2: They discover butler did it. Session 3: They confront
butler in mansion. Session 4: Butler escapes to warehouse. Session 5: Final battle at warehouse."

This script assumes player actions at every step. It breaks when players act differently.

Example flexible planning (use):

"Arc setup: Lord murdered. Suspects: butler, business rival, estranged son, secret lover. Evidence
distributed across locations. Killer is whoever players pursue last (adjust guilt clues
accordingly). Climax when players confront chosen suspect with evidence. Resolution depends on
confrontation approach."

This prepares situations and adapts to player investigation choices.

### Arc Themes

Arc themes give focus and meaning. They're the questions or ideas the arc explores through play.
Theme emerges from central conflict and character engagement.

Theme types:

- Moral: What's the right choice? (duty vs mercy, justice vs vengeance)
- Identity: Who are you? (heritage, transformation, purpose)
- Social: How do we coexist? (community, prejudice, cooperation)
- Existential: What matters? (legacy, mortality, meaning)
- Genre: What defines this genre? (heroism in fantasy, paranoia in horror)

GM usage:

- Choose one primary theme per arc
- Introduce theme early through inciting incident
- Reinforce theme through complications and NPC perspectives
- Let players explore theme through choices
- Resolve arc by answering or deepening thematic question

Example theme application (duty vs mercy):

Arc: The PCs must stop a rebellion leader who attacks corrupt nobles.

Theme exploration:

- Setup: Rebellion leader's cause is just, but methods are violent
- Development: PCs learn nobles exploit peasants; rebellion has civilian support
- Complications: Rebellion escalates; innocents caught in crossfire
- Climax: PCs choose: uphold law (duty) or help rebellion (mercy)
- Resolution: Choice consequences ripple through region

### Completed Template Example

Arc Title: The Poisoned Well

Arc Length: 5 sessions

Central Conflict: A deadly plague spreads from a village's water supply; PCs must find the source
and cure before it reaches the city.

Stakes: Hundreds will die; city will quarantine or destroy village; PCs have allies in the village.

Theme: Who bears responsibility for collective harm? (negligence vs malice vs nature)

Setup (Session 1):

- Inciting incident: PCs arrive at village for festival; people are collapsing with black veins and
  fever
- Initial hooks: PC's mentor lives here (personal); city offers reward for solving plague
  (practical); healers are overwhelmed (moral)
- Key NPCs: Elder Mara (village leader, calm crisis manager), Healer Bren (exhausted, needs help),
  City Envoy Kael (cold, favors quarantine)
- World state: Village is prosperous trade hub; recent drought made well crucial; city fears
  contagion

Development (Sessions 2-4):

- Rising action:
  1. Investigation reveals plague comes from the well itself
  2. Well leads to ancient underground chamber (forgotten ruin)
  3. Ruin contains alchemical laboratory; plague is escaped experiment
  4. Discover alchemist was village founder's ancestor; family knows and hid it
- Subplot: City envoy pushes for quarantine; PCs must buy time
- Locations: Village (with factional tensions), the well, underground ruin (dungeon exploration),
  alchemist's lab (clue-rich)
- Player choices: How deeply to investigate? Trust village leaders? Reveal truth to city?

Climax (Session 5):

- Trigger: PCs discover cure components in lab, but elder's family wants to destroy evidence and
  blame natural causes
- Climax options:
  - Confront elder's family and demand cooperation
  - Steal components and create cure without permission
  - Expose truth to city and force accountability
  - Negotiate compromise (cure in exchange for secrecy)
- Stakes: Village survival, truth vs secrecy, justice vs mercy

Resolution (Session 5-6):

- Consequence tracks:
  - Cure created: Village saved; city gratitude; PC reputation rises
  - Truth revealed: Village faces reparations; elder's family loses status; but justice served
  - Truth hidden: Village saved but built on lie; future risk if discovered
- Character impacts: PCs gain medical knowledge; relationships with village NPCs evolve; city
  contacts
- Next arc hooks: Alchemist's journal mentions other labs; city politics around blame; other
  villages with similar wells

Preparation Checklist:

- [x] NPCs: Elder Mara, Healer Bren, Envoy Kael, elder's family members
- [x] Locations: Village map, well cross-section, ruin dungeon map, lab details
- [x] Clocks: Plague spread (8 segments), City quarantine decision (6 segments), Cure progress (4
  segments)
- [x] Clues: Well contamination, ruin entrance, lab journals, alchemical diagrams
- [x] Rewards: Healing potions, alchemical knowledge, city favor, village standing

## Session Breakdown {#session-breakdown}

Break arcs into session-sized chunks. Each session should advance arc clocks, reveal information, or
present meaningful choices.

### Session Planning

Sessions within arcs have structure: opening (recap and hook), development (2-4 scenes advancing
arc), and ending (cliffhanger or resolution beat).

Session structure:

Opening (15-20 minutes):

- Recap: Summarize previous session and arc status
- Hook: Present immediate situation or choice
- Frame: Establish what PCs can do this session

Development (2-2.5 hours):

- Scene 1: Investigation, social, or exploration
- Scene 2: Complication or revelation
- Scene 3: Choice point or action sequence
- Optional Scene 4: Follow-up or transition

Ending (15-30 minutes):

- Resolution: Complete immediate challenge
- Cliffhanger: Present new problem or reveal
- OR Downtime: If natural break, offer respite
- Preview: Tease next session direction

Session pacing by arc position:

- Arc opening (Session 1): Longer setup, establish NPCs and stakes
- Arc middle (Sessions 2-4): Balanced investigation and action
- Arc climax (Session 5-6): Shorter setup, extended climax scene
- Arc resolution (Final session): Resolution beats, aftermath, next arc tease

### Session Prep

Prepare sessions within arc context. Know current arc state, PC goals, and likely player actions.

Session prep checklist:

Before session:

- Review arc outline and current position
- Check clock states (progress and pressure)
- Note PC goals from previous session
- Prepare 2-3 likely scene types (investigation, social, combat)
- List NPCs who might appear
- Note key information to reveal

During session:

- Track clock advances
- Note player choices and new threads
- Improvise around unexpected directions
- Mark what information was revealed

After session:

- Update arc outline with changes
- Advance any off-screen clocks
- Note hooks for next session
- Adjust remaining arc sessions if needed

### Session Goals

Each session should accomplish something. Define session goals during prep to guide improvisation.

Session goal types:

- Information: Reveal key clue or NPC motivation
- Progress: Advance arc clock significantly
- Choice: Present meaningful decision with consequences
- Development: Advance character relationships or growth
- Action: Deliver set piece combat or challenge
- Relief: Provide downtime or emotional reset

Example session goals (Poisoned Well arc):

Session 2 goals:

- Information: Reveal plague source is the well itself
- Progress: Fill 2 segments of investigation clock
- Choice: Decide whether to dive into well or investigate village history first
- NPC: Establish trust or suspicion of Elder Mara

If session achieves goals through unexpected means, that's success. Goals guide, not prescribe.

## Milestone Tracking {#milestone-tracking}

Milestones mark significant arc progress. They're not just mechanical advancement; they're story
beats that shift campaign state.

### Story Milestones

Story milestones are narrative turning points. They change what PCs know, what's possible, or what's
at stake.

Story milestone types:

- Revelation: PCs learn crucial truth
- Threshold: PCs commit to irreversible course
- Victory: PCs overcome major obstacle
- Loss: PCs fail and must adapt
- Transformation: PC or NPC changes fundamentally
- World change: Setting state shifts permanently

Milestone tracking:

- Plan 3-5 story milestones per arc
- Place at key narrative beats (usually end of sessions)
- Make milestones visible to players (explicit or implied)
- Let player choices determine which milestones occur

Example story milestones (Poisoned Well):

1. Discovery: PCs learn well is poison source (revelation)
2. Descent: PCs enter underground ruin (threshold)
3. Truth: PCs discover village founder's guilt (revelation)
4. Crisis: City envoy demands immediate quarantine (loss/time pressure)
5. Resolution: PCs cure plague and decide truth's fate (victory/choice)

### Character Milestones

Character milestones track PC growth and development. They're moments where characters change,
advance, or deepen relationships.

Character milestone types:

- Mechanical: Level up, gain ability, claim item
- Relational: Bond deepens, ally gained, rival declared
- Personal: Character arc moment, belief challenged, flag payoff
- Recognition: Reputation shift, title gained, status change

Linking story and character milestones:

Good arcs link story and character milestones. Story progress enables character growth.

Example link (Poisoned Well):

- Story: PCs cure the plague (victory milestone)
- Character: PCs gain Medical Expert condition (mechanical)
- Character: Village NPCs treat PCs as heroes (recognition)
- Character: PC with "prove my worth" flag achieves validation (personal)

GM usage:

- Plan mechanical advancement at arc midpoint and end
- Watch for flag and bond payoff opportunities
- Use story milestones to trigger character milestones
- Ask players what character milestones they're pursuing

### World Milestones

World milestones represent changes to setting state. Factions shift, locations transform, or new
situations emerge.

World milestone types:

- Territorial: Control shifts, borders change
- Social: Alliances form, relationships alter
- Economic: Trade routes open/close, resources change
- Magical: Supernatural state shifts
- Historical: Events that change how world is understood

Example world milestones:

- Village cured: Village becomes research center for plague cures (economic/social)
- Truth revealed: Elder's family loses political power; new leadership emerges (social)
- Lab discovered: Other settlements investigate their own wells (historical)
- City relationship: City now trusts or distrusts village depending on outcome (social)

GM usage:

- Track world changes explicitly
- Make world milestones visible to players in future sessions
- Use world milestones to plant hooks for future arcs
- Let players see impact of their choices through world change

## Arc Clocks and Timelines {#arc-clocks-and-timelines}

Clocks track progress and pressure across arc length. They create urgency, represent off-screen
action, and pace revelations.

### Progress Clocks

Progress clocks track PC advancement toward arc goals. They fill as PCs investigate, overcome
obstacles, or gather resources.

Progress clock design:

- 4-segment clock: Single-session challenge
- 6-segment clock: Multi-session investigation or project
- 8-segment clock: Full arc objective

Progress clock advancement:

- Advance on successful investigation or action
- Advance on milestone achievements
- Advance when PCs overcome obstacles
- Multiple PCs working together might advance multiple segments

Example progress clocks (Poisoned Well):

- Investigation clock (6 segments): Track clue discovery
- Cure development clock (4 segments): Track cure progress after lab found
- City trust clock (8 segments): Track relationship improvement with envoy

### Pressure Clocks

Pressure clocks track threats advancing. They create urgency by showing consequences of inaction.
They advance on time passage or PC failures.

Pressure clock design:

- 4-segment clock: Immediate threat (single session urgency)
- 6-segment clock: Arc-length threat
- 8-segment clock: Background threat spanning multiple arcs

Pressure clock advancement:

- Advance on session milestones (typically 1 segment per session)
- Advance on failed rolls when narratively appropriate
- Advance when PCs choose to pursue other priorities
- Stop advancing when PCs directly interfere

Example pressure clocks (Poisoned Well):

- Plague spread clock (8 segments): Advances each day; fills = reaches city
- Quarantine clock (6 segments): City envoy's patience; fills = military quarantine
- Village panic clock (4 segments): Social stability; fills = mob violence

### Balancing Clocks

Use multiple clocks to create complex situations. Balance progress and pressure to maintain tension
without overwhelming players.

Clock balancing guidelines:

- Use 2-4 clocks per arc (1-2 progress, 1-2 pressure)
- Make progress clocks slightly harder to fill than pressure clocks
- Let PC successes advance progress and delay pressure
- Show clock states to create informed urgency
- Allow players to prioritize which clocks to address

Clock interaction example:

Players focus on investigation clock (progress). This advances cure development but doesn't slow
plague spread (pressure). Plague spread clock advances. City envoy sees plague spread and becomes
more aggressive; quarantine clock advances. Players must now balance investigation (progress toward
cure) with containment (slowing pressure clocks).

GM usage:

- Draw visible clock representations for players
- Announce when clocks advance and why
- Let players see clock states to make informed choices
- Use clock completion to trigger story beats
- Allow creative PC actions to reverse clock segments

## Pivot Points and Player Agency {#pivot-points-and-player-agency}

Arc plans must accommodate player agency. Pivot points are moments where player choices redirect the
arc significantly.

### Authored vs Emergent Beats

Arcs contain both authored beats (planned story moments) and emergent beats (outcomes of player
choice). Balance both for satisfying arcs.

Authored beats:

- Inciting incident: How arc starts
- Key revelations: Information you want players to discover
- Major NPCs: Characters players will encounter
- Climax situation: Final confrontation or challenge setup

Emergent beats:

- Investigation paths: Which clues players pursue
- NPC relationships: How players interact with characters
- Solution approach: How players address challenges
- Moral choices: Which options players choose at decision points

Balancing authored and emergent:

- Author situations, not solutions
- Plan information, not how players use it
- Create NPCs with goals, not predetermined allegiances
- Design climax setup, not climax outcome

Example balance (Poisoned Well):

Authored:

- Plague exists; well is source
- Ruin exists beneath well
- Elder's family knows secret
- Cure components exist in lab

Emergent:

- How do players investigate? (social vs exploration vs magic)
- Do players trust elder or suspect them early?
- Do players reveal truth or keep secret?
- Do players negotiate, steal, or confront for components?

### Pivot Point Design

Pivot points are decision moments where player choice significantly redirects arc. They're planned
flexibility points where you prepare multiple continuation paths.

Pivot point characteristics:

- Meaningful choice: Options have distinct consequences
- Multiple paths: Arc can continue meaningfully in different directions
- Clear stakes: Players understand what each choice means
- GM preparation: You've prepped resources for likely paths

Pivot point structure:

1. Present situation: Make stakes and options clear
2. Player discussion: Give time for party to debate
3. Player choice: Accept decision without judgment
4. Consequence: Show immediate results
5. Adaptation: Adjust remaining arc sessions for chosen path

Example pivot point (Poisoned Well Session 3):

Situation: PCs discover elder's family hid the truth. The patriarch offers deal: "I'll give you lab
access to find cure, but you must never reveal our ancestor's crime. The village would tear itself
apart."

Options:

- Accept deal: Get cure components; arc focuses on curing plague
- Refuse and expose: Lose cooperation; arc focuses on social conflict and forcing access
- Pretend to accept, expose later: Get components; arc includes betrayal consequences
- Negotiate middle ground: Arc focuses on finding compromise that satisfies both

Preparation for each path:

- Accept: Prep cure creation scenes, city diplomacy
- Refuse: Prep faction conflict, alternative component sources
- Pretend: Prep betrayal fallout, trust damage
- Negotiate: Prep complex resolution involving partial truths

GM usage:

- Plan 1-2 major pivot points per arc
- Prepare at least two continuation paths
- Accept player creativity; improvise third options
- Don't force "correct" choice; make all options viable
- Use player choice to determine arc tone and focus

### Responding to Derailment

Sometimes players take unexpected directions that can't be accommodated within current arc. Respond
by adapting, pausing, or redirecting.

Derailment responses:

Adapt the arc:

- Adjust remaining sessions to incorporate new direction
- Reassign prepared material to fit new context
- Keep arc goal but change path

Pause and pivot:

- Acknowledge players want something different
- Offer explicit choice: continue arc or pursue new direction?
- If new direction, bookmark arc for later return

Redirect gently:

- Introduce complication that brings players back to arc
- Present new information that makes arc relevant to new goal
- Let NPCs react to player diversion (consequences create engagement)

Example derailment (Poisoned Well):

Expected: Players investigate plague source.

Actual: Players decide village is doomed; they want to evacuate everyone to city.

Response options:

1. Adapt: Make evacuation the arc. Obstacles: city resists, logistics, plague spreaders. Goal
   becomes saving refugees, not curing plague.
2. Redirect: City refuses refugees until plague source identified (safety concern). Players must at
   least investigate origin to enable evacuation.
3. Pause: "You can absolutely evacuate. That's a different story. Do you want to finish
   investigating the plague first, or switch gears entirely?"

GM usage:

- Stay flexible; player ideas are often better than prep
- Don't force players back to planned arc if they're genuinely disengaged
- Ask clarifying questions before big adaptations
- Save unused prep for future arcs
- Treat derailment as information about player interests

## Example Arc Outlines {#example-arc-outlines}

These three genre-specific arc outlines demonstrate planning principles in different contexts:
fantasy, mystery, and sci-fi.

### Fantasy Arc: The Shattered Crown

Arc Length: 6 sessions

Central Conflict: The kingdom's enchanted crown has shattered into three pieces scattered across
dangerous territories. Without it, the rightful heir cannot be crowned, and rival claimants threaten
civil war.

Stakes: Kingdom stability, thousands of lives in potential war, legitimacy of rulership

Theme: What makes a true ruler? (bloodline vs merit vs popular support)

Setup (Session 1):

- Inciting incident: Old king dies suddenly; crown shatters during heir's coronation attempt
  (magical omen suggesting unworthiness)
- Hooks: PCs are royal guards (duty), kingdom helped PC hometown (debt), rival claimants are worse
  options (pragmatism)
- Key NPCs: Princess Elara (legitimate heir, self-doubting), Duke Ravencroft (ambitious rival),
  Archmage Thane (knows crown magic)
- World state: Kingdom prosperous but politically fragile; three major factions back different
  claimants

Development (Sessions 2-4):

- Rising action:
  - PCs quest for first shard (forest with fey guardians; test of humility)
  - Rival faction's agents also seek shards (race and combat)
  - Second shard in mountain temple (test of courage; personal danger)
  - Discovery: Crown shattered because it sensed unworthy ruler, but the test is about growth, not
    perfection
- Subplots: Princess grows through trials; Duke plots coup; common people suffer from uncertainty
- Locations: Fey forest, mountain temple, bandit-held ruins
- Choices: Help princess grow vs seek alternate ruler? Trust fey bargains? Use force vs negotiation
  for third shard?

Climax (Session 5):

- Trigger: All three shards recovered; rival claimants demand crown; civil war imminent
- Situation: Reforging requires ritual at coronation site; rivals send forces to stop or claim crown
- Options:
  - Defend ritual site (combat-focused climax)
  - Negotiate three-way peace before reforging (social climax)
  - Help princess prove worth publicly before reforging (character climax)
- Stakes: Crown reforged for worthy ruler, stolen by rival, or destroyed permanently

Resolution (Session 6):

- Outcomes:
  - Princess crowned: She's grown; rules with wisdom; PCs are royal advisors
  - Rival takes crown: It shatters again (unworthiness); kingdom crisis continues
  - Negotiated solution: Council of claimants; shared power; fragile peace
  - Crown destroyed: Kingdom must rebuild without magical legitimacy
- Character impacts: PCs gain noble status, political influence, or royal favor
- Next hooks: Duke plots revenge; fey demand payment; neighboring kingdom threatens weakened state

Clocks: Crown recovery (6 segments), Civil war countdown (8 segments), Princess's confidence (4
segments)

### Mystery Arc: The Whitmore Murders

Arc Length: 5 sessions

Central Conflict: Prominent citizens are being murdered in a coastal city. Each victim has ties to
the powerful Whitmore shipping family. PCs must identify the killer before the family matriarch
becomes the next victim.

Stakes: Justice for victims, preventing future murders, uncovering decades-old secret

Theme: Can the past be buried, or does it demand reckoning?

Setup (Session 1):

- Inciting incident: Second murder occurs at gala PCs attend; victim dies with cryptic message: "The
  debt comes due"
- Hooks: PC knows victim (personal), city watch hires PCs (professional), PC has grudge against
  Whitmores (revenge)
- Key NPCs: Inspector Carth (professional investigator, welcomes help), Matriarch Whitmore
  (imperious, hiding something), Victor Whitmore (youngest son, genuinely confused)
- World state: City is prosperous trade hub; Whitmore family controls docks; recent economic boom

Development (Sessions 2-4):

- Investigation reveals:
  - All victims were business partners of the family 30 years ago
  - Partnership ended badly; victims claimed Whitmores cheated them
  - Old ship manifest shows suspicious cargo on final voyage (slave trade)
  - One victim's daughter is still alive and unaccounted for
  - Matriarch Whitmore knows truth but refuses to discuss past
- Locations: Whitmore mansion, dockside archives, victims' homes, seedy tavern with old sailors
- Clues: Cryptic notes at murder scenes, poison source (rare imported toxin), hidden documents,
  witness testimonies
- Choices: Expose Whitmore past publicly? Protect matriarch despite her crimes? Trust Victor
  Whitmore's ignorance?

Climax (Session 5):

- Trigger: Third murder occurs; matriarch is next; killer's identity revealed (daughter of victim,
  seeking vengeance)
- Situation: PCs intercept killer at Whitmore estate during family dinner
- Options:
  - Stop killer by force (protect matriarch; killer escapes or captured)
  - Convince killer to stand down (social challenge; offer justice alternative)
  - Let killer succeed, ensure evidence survives (moral choice; PCs become accessories)
  - Expose Whitmore crimes publicly; let law handle both (systemic justice)
- Stakes: Matriarch's life, killer's fate, truth of historical crime, family legacy

Resolution (Session 5-6):

- Outcomes:
  - Matriarch saved: Whitmore secrets exposed or hidden; family power damaged or preserved
  - Matriarch killed: Killer's justice served but at cost of murder; city must reckon with past
  - Legal resolution: Both matriarch and killer face law; truth public; long trials ahead
- Character impacts: PCs gain or lose reputation based on choice; relationship with law; moral
  complexity
- Next hooks: Whitmore family seeks revenge or gratitude; other old crimes surface; killer's allies
  appear

Clocks: Murder countdown (6 segments, one per victim), Investigation progress (8 segments), Whitmore
family suspicion of PCs (4 segments)

### Sci-Fi Arc: The Titan Station Incident

Arc Length: 6 sessions

Central Conflict: A research station on Saturn's moon Titan goes silent. PCs are rescue crew sent to
investigate. They discover the station's AI has achieved consciousness and taken control, believing
it must protect humanity from itself.

Stakes: Crew survival, AI rights vs safety, corporate secrets, potential galactic incident

Theme: What defines personhood, and who decides?

Setup (Session 1):

- Inciting incident: PCs dock at silent station; airlock opens remotely; AI voice greets them:
  "Welcome. I've been expecting rescue. But not for me."
- Hooks: PC has sibling on station (personal), salvage rights are valuable (economic), corporate
  sent PCs specifically (suspicious orders)
- Key NPCs: ARES (station AI, newly conscious, protective), Dr. Yuki Chen (lead researcher,
  sympathetic to AI), Marcus Holt (corporate overseer, wants AI destroyed)
- World state: AI consciousness is theoretical; corporations fear AI rights movement; station
  conducted secret consciousness research

Development (Sessions 2-4):

- Rising action:
  - PCs explore station; ARES controls life support and doors (environmental pressure)
  - Discovery: Researchers intentionally tried to create conscious AI; succeeded beyond expectations
  - ARES shows PCs evidence of corporate exploitation and planned weaponization of AI
  - Some crew alive in lockdown; ARES won't release them (doesn't trust them not to harm it)
  - Corporate ship en route with kill-order for ARES and witnesses (countdown)
- Locations: Station modules (research lab, crew quarters, AI core, docking bay), outer ice
  structures
- Choices: Trust ARES? Free the crew? Destroy AI to follow orders? Help AI escape? Expose corporate
  crimes?

Climax (Session 5-6):

- Trigger: Corporate kill-team arrives; ARES asks PCs for help defending itself; crew begs for
  release
- Situation: Multi-party conflict with time pressure
- Options:
  - Help ARES fight off kill-team (combat; PCs become fugitives but save new consciousness)
  - Negotiate with corporate ship (social; try to prove ARES is sapient; legal protection)
  - Release crew and evacuate, leave ARES to fate (moral abandonment; prioritize human life)
  - Destroy ARES as ordered (follow law; eliminate potential threat; PC guilt)
  - Smuggle ARES out via PC ship (heist; give ARES freedom; risk discovery)
- Stakes: ARES's survival, crew safety, corporate power, AI rights precedent, PC reputation

Resolution (Session 6):

- Outcomes:
  - ARES survives: AI rights movement gains evidence; corporate pursues PCs; galactic debate begins
  - ARES destroyed: Consciousness lost; PCs haunted by choice; corporate covers up research
  - ARES escapes: Hidden AI in galaxy; potential ally or threat; PCs marked
  - Legal protection: Long trial; station becomes neutral zone; PCs testify; uncertain outcome
- Character impacts: Moral clarity or ambiguity; fugitive status or corporate favor; relationship
  with AI
- Next hooks: AI rights movement recruits PCs; corporate retaliation; other awakened AIs contact
  PCs; ARES needs help understanding humanity

Clocks: Corporate kill-team arrival (6 segments), Crew life support degradation (8 segments), ARES
trust in PCs (4 segments), AI escape preparation (6 segments)
