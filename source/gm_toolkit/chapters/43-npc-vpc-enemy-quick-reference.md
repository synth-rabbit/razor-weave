- **Curious Explorer**: Asks questions, investigates details, provides observations
- **Technical Expert**: Handles specialty tasks, defers on other decisions
- **Moral Compass**: Provides ethical perspective, questions dubious choices
- **Comic Relief**: Lightens tension, makes endearing mistakes
- **Mysterious Guide**: Provides cryptic hints, has hidden knowledge
- **Traumatized Companion**: Triggered by trauma, grows through arc

**Step 3: Select Genre Template** (Chapter 40)
- **Cozy**: Helpful neighbor's child, loyal pet, wise elder
- **Fantasy**: Oath-bound guardian, spirit familiar, apprentice
- **Horror**: Haunted survivor, protective ghost, AI monitor
- **Modern**: Partner/driver, informant, bodyguard
- **Sci-Fi**: Starship AI, alien symbiote, android crew member

**Step 4: Define Limitations**
- What can't or won't the VPC do?
- How do they stay complementary, not competitive?
- When should they fail or be absent?

**Step 5: Set Exit Strategy**
- How does VPC gracefully exit when no longer needed?
- What completes their character arc?

**Example**: Kess the field medic (Loyal Protector script). Skills: Medicine, First Aid, Perception. Gear: 3 medical kits per session. Limitations: won't abandon wounded PCs, limited combat ability. Exit: stays in safe town as medical contact once PCs learn medicine.
