# NPC Packs by Genre {#npc-packs}

This chapter provides 25 complete, ready-to-use NPCs organized by genre. Each NPC includes personality, goals, secrets, mechanical skills, and GM usage guidance. You can drop these characters directly into your campaign or use them as templates for creating similar NPCs. All NPCs reference the role-based frameworks from Chapter 7.

## How to Use Premade NPCs {#how-to-use}

**Drop-In Play**: Each NPC is complete and ready for immediate use. Read the entry, note their goal and secret, and introduce them into your session. Their personality traits and GM usage notes give you everything needed to roleplay them consistently.

**Customization Starting Points**: Adapt names, personality details, or specific goals to fit your campaign's tone and existing fiction. The core structure—role, skills, secret—provides a solid foundation for customization.

**Genre Mixing**: While organized by genre, many NPCs translate easily across settings with minor reskinning. A cozy baker becomes a space station chef; a fantasy merchant becomes a modern shopkeeper; a sci-fi corporate agent becomes a fantasy guild enforcer.

**Relationship Building**: Use the influence tracking and attitude tools from Chapter 7 to evolve these NPCs through play. Mark how PCs treat them and adjust their responses accordingly.

## Cozy NPCs {#cozy-npcs}

Community-focused characters who drive gentle stakes and heartfelt stories.

### Poppy Kettle — Friendly Baker (Ally) {#npc-cozy-poppy-kettle}

**Personality**: Generous, warm, impossible to leave her shop without accepting treats. The village's emotional center and unofficial news hub.

**Goal**: Maintain community harmony through nourishment and connection. She believes fed people argue less and neighbors who share bread share trust.

**Secret**: Keeps a mental ledger of who meets behind the mill after dark and which couples are courting secretly. Knows more than she says.

**Skills**: Cooking, Hospitality, Gossip

**Notable Trait**: Apron pockets always contain spare cookies and folded IOUs. Laughs like a bell, feeds everyone without question.

**GM Usage**: Use Poppy to connect PCs to village networks and rumor mills. Her shop becomes the natural gathering point for information and community problems. Create hooks through catering emergencies, supply shortages, or protecting her from external threats. PCs who treat her kindly gain reliable access to local intelligence and free meals.

### Lars Bramble — Nosy Neighbor (Informant) {#npc-cozy-lars-bramble}

**Personality**: Busybody, detail-oriented, means well but exhaustingly intrusive. Watches windows and remembers schedules better than anyone asked.

**Goal**: Feel important and involved in village life. Wants recognition for being observant and helpful, even when help wasn't requested.

**Secret**: Actually witnessed a crucial late-night meeting and knows exactly who was there, but needs to feel valued enough to share.

**Skills**: Perception, Local Knowledge, Gossip

**Notable Trait**: Peers through curtains without subtlety. Always "just happened to notice" incredibly specific details.

**GM Usage**: Lars provides information PCs need but makes them work for it socially. He'll share if made to feel important or included. Use him for clues hidden in mundane observations—he noticed the baker's daughter crying, the shopkeeper's unusual delivery, or the stranger's odd hours. PCs must navigate his nosiness without offending him.

### Maeve Thatcher — Retired Artisan (Mentor) {#npc-cozy-maeve-thatcher}

**Personality**: Patient, skilled, takes pride in traditional methods. Sees teaching as preserving cultural knowledge for future generations.

**Goal**: Pass on weaving and dyeing techniques before they're lost to mass production. Wants at least one apprentice to carry the craft forward.

**Secret**: Her hands are failing from arthritis, making detailed work increasingly painful. She hides this limitation but it's progressing.

**Skills**: Crafting (Textiles), Teaching, Herbalism (Dyes)

**Notable Trait**: Work-worn hands that still move with practiced precision despite the pain. Studio smells of wool and plant dyes.

**GM Usage**: Maeve teaches PCs crafting skills or provides expertise on fabric analysis, historic patterns, or natural dyes. Use her physical limitations to create urgency—she needs help completing an important project before she can't work anymore. Her knowledge connects to mysteries involving old textiles, family heirlooms, or traditional ceremonies. Reward PCs who show genuine interest in learning.

### Griffon Reed — Rival Shopkeeper (Rival) {#npc-cozy-griffon-reed}

**Personality**: Competitive but fair, takes seasonal competitions seriously, grudgingly respects quality work from others.

**Goal**: Win the autumn festival's "Best Shop Display" competition and prove his merchandising instincts superior to the establishment.

**Secret**: Secretly admires PC creativity and presentation skills. Considers asking for collaboration but pride prevents him.

**Skills**: Persuasion, Appraisal, Merchandising

**Notable Trait**: Window displays change weekly, each more elaborate than the last. Keeps detailed notes on competitor displays.

**GM Usage**: Griffon creates friendly competition around festivals, displays, or community projects. He'll compete hard but won't sabotage. Use him to introduce time-pressured creative challenges or to provide unusual resources if PCs earn his respect. He can become an ally if PCs face a common threat to local business or help him with a display crisis.

### Silas Dusk — Mysterious Stranger (Antagonist) {#npc-cozy-silas-dusk}

**Personality**: Charming, evasive about his past, asks pointed questions about village history and land ownership.

**Goal**: Locate a hidden family heirloom buried somewhere in the village before developing the land. Willing to buy properties or manipulate records.

**Secret**: Represents distant relatives with legal claim to contested land. His presence threatens several families' homes and the village green.

**Skills**: Deception, Research, Persuasion

**Notable Trait**: Impeccably dressed for country life, never quite fits in. Carries old letters and property maps.

**GM Usage**: Silas disrupts village peace through legal and social pressure rather than violence. He's not cruel but is relentless in pursuing his goal. Create tension through his offers to buy properties, questions about old deeds, or charm campaigns with local officials. He's vulnerable to community solidarity and can be negotiated with if shown a compromise that satisfies his actual goal (finding the heirloom) without destroying the village.

---

## Fantasy NPCs {#fantasy-npcs}

Characters who populate kingdoms, courts, taverns, and dangerous roads.

### Cora Nightingale — Wandering Bard (Informant) {#npc-fantasy-cora-nightingale}

**Personality**: Storyteller, charming, collects rumors like coins. Treats information as performance material and currency.

**Goal**: Gather enough exciting stories to secure patronage at a noble's court. Wants tales of heroism, scandal, and adventure.

**Secret**: Carries letters between rebel factions disguised as song sheets. May offer PCs information in exchange for becoming part of a story worth telling.

**Skills**: Performance, Gossip, Deception

**Notable Trait**: Lute case contains more hidden compartments than strings. Never forgets a story or a debt.

**GM Usage**: Cora provides rumors, political intelligence, and setting context through storytelling. She trades information for tales or payment, but her stories are 80% accurate with 20% embellishment for entertainment. Use her to introduce plot hooks as "rumors she's heard" or to spread PC reputations (for good or ill). She can be recruited as a messenger if PCs need discrete communication.

### Lord Castor Vaughn — Scheming Noble (Antagonist) {#npc-fantasy-lord-castor-vaughn}

**Personality**: Ambitious, politically savvy, treats everything as a chess match. Respects competent opponents.

**Goal**: Secure a seat on the Royal Council by outmaneuvering rivals and demonstrating indispensability to the crown.

**Secret**: His younger sister is the family's true genius; he relies on her advice but publicly takes credit to maintain his position.

**Skills**: Persuasion, Tactics, Court Etiquette

**Notable Trait**: Always positioned to overhear important conversations. Expensive clothes worn with calculated casualness.

**GM Usage**: Castor opposes PCs when their goals conflict with his political advancement. He prefers manipulation and social pressure to violence. Use him to create political obstacles, frame challenges as negotiations, or offer mutually beneficial deals with strings attached. His vulnerability is his sister—threatening her safety or revealing his dependency undermines his authority. He can become a useful ally if convinced PC goals align with his interests.

### Thane Redgrave — Grizzled Mercenary (Ally) {#npc-fantasy-thane-redgrave}

**Personality**: Loyal, pragmatic, battle-scarred. Respects competence and hates wasted lives. Gruff exterior hides protective instincts.

**Goal**: Complete one last contract with enough pay to retire and fund an orphanage in memory of fallen comrades.

**Secret**: Shelters a war orphan he rescued years ago. The child's safety is his primary vulnerability and motivation.

**Skills**: Melee Combat, Tactics, Survival

**Notable Trait**: Sword worn smooth from decades of use. Speaks in battlefield metaphors and tactical assessments.

**GM Usage**: Thane provides martial expertise, tactical planning, and direct combat support when hired or allied. He's professional and honorable but not cheap—he needs real payment or a cause that protects the innocent. Use him to teach combat skills, plan assaults, or serve as reliable backup. Threaten the orphan to create moral pressure. He'll sacrifice himself for the child or for PCs who've earned his trust.

### Archivist Ellyn Corvid — Court Wizard (Mentor) {#npc-fantasy-ellyn-corvid}

**Personality**: Powerful, cryptic, speaks in riddles and historical precedents. Genuinely wants to preserve magical knowledge.

**Goal**: Train at least one worthy successor before her accumulated knowledge dies with her. Fears becoming the last of her tradition.

**Secret**: Made a binding oath decades ago that prevents her from leaving the royal archives. She's essentially a gilded prisoner.

**Skills**: Arcana, Research, Ritual Magic

**Notable Trait**: Eyes reflect candlelight strangely. Office filled with reference books, spell diagrams, and protective wards.

**GM Usage**: Ellyn provides magical knowledge, ritual guidance, and historical context. She teaches through riddles and challenges, forcing PCs to think critically rather than receiving easy answers. Her confinement limits direct intervention—she can't leave to help, so PCs must act on her information. Use her to introduce magical lore, analyze artifacts, or provide research support. She can teach basic ritual magic if PCs prove dedicated students.

### Harrow Dane — Tavern Owner (Informant/Ally) {#npc-fantasy-harrow-dane}

**Personality**: Neutral, observant, maintains strict peace in his establishment. Protects his bar's reputation as safe ground.

**Goal**: Keep the Laughing Griffin profitable and violence-free. Wants peace, profit, and repeat customers from all sides.

**Secret**: Provides discrete meeting space for rival factions because neutrality is profitable. Knows more about local politics than anyone realizes.

**Skills**: Hospitality, Insight, Streetwise

**Notable Trait**: Polish the same glass when thinking. Bar room goes silent when he clears his throat.

**GM Usage**: Harrow's tavern serves as neutral ground for meetings, information gathering, and hearing rumors. He'll share what he's overheard for free with good customers, or sell more specific intelligence for favors that protect his business. Use him to broker meetings between hostile parties or provide safe space after conflicts. Threatening his establishment or breaking the peace earns permanent ban and loss of valuable access.

---

## Horror/Mystery NPCs {#horror-mystery-npcs}

Allies, suspects, and catalysts for investigation and dread.

### Marcus Webb — Haunted Witness (Informant) {#npc-horror-marcus-webb}

**Personality**: Traumatized, skittish, memory unreliable but genuinely tries to help. Desperately wants to forget but can't.

**Goal**: Make the nightmares stop. Willing to help investigators if it means understanding and ending what he witnessed.

**Secret**: Saw the entity clearly during an encounter but his mind keeps rewriting the memory as self-protection. The true description is buried under psychological trauma.

**Skills**: Recall (Traumatic), Local Knowledge, Evasion

**Notable Trait**: Starts sentences confident then trails off. Hands shake when describing events. Avoids mirrors.

**GM Usage**: Marcus provides crucial clues wrapped in trauma and unreliable memory. PCs must use compassion and patience to extract useful information without re-traumatizing him. Use gentle Investigation or Empathy checks to piece together truth from fragmented recollections. His fear is genuine—he'll bolt if pushed too hard. Successfully helping him recover memories might also help him heal, creating emotional stakes.

### Detective Sarah Rourke — Skeptical Detective (Rival/Ally) {#npc-horror-detective-rourke}

**Personality**: Rational, methodical, worldview built on evidence and logic. Deeply uncomfortable with anything supernatural.

**Goal**: Solve the case through conventional investigation and preserve her rational understanding of reality.

**Secret**: Witnessed something unexplainable during a previous case. Buried the evidence and transferred to avoid confronting it.

**Skills**: Investigation, Deduction, Interview

**Notable Trait**: Carries detailed case notes everywhere. Taps pencil three times when processing information. Coffee always black, always cold.

**GM Usage**: Rourke investigates the same case as PCs but dismisses supernatural explanations, creating friction. Use her as rival initially—she might obstruct PC methods or arrest them for breaking laws. As evidence accumulates, she slowly accepts the impossible, becoming a reluctant ally. Her investigative skills and official authority complement PC capabilities once she's convinced. Her conversion from skeptic to believer provides character arc and validation for PC work.

### Brother Silas Crowe — Cult Recruiter (Antagonist) {#npc-horror-brother-silas-crowe}

**Personality**: Charismatic, compassionate presentation hiding calculated manipulation. Offers simple answers to complex suffering.

**Goal**: Recruit vulnerable people into the cult by offering community, purpose, and promised protection from the chaos of the world.

**Secret**: Genuinely believes the cult's teachings will save humanity, making him a true believer rather than cynical manipulator. This conviction makes him more dangerous.

**Skills**: Persuasion, Empathy (weaponized), Occult Lore

**Notable Trait**: Warm smile that never reaches his eyes. Always knows exactly what troubled people need to hear.

**GM Usage**: Silas preys on vulnerable NPCs and potentially on PCs during moments of weakness or loss. He's not overtly threatening—he offers help, community, and meaning. Use him to create moral complexity: people he recruits genuinely feel better initially. His weakness is isolation and exposure—separated from the cult's support structure and confronted with consequences of the teachings, his conviction wavers. Create opportunities for PCs to rescue victims before full indoctrination.

### Dr. Helena Ashford — Occult Scholar (Mentor) {#npc-horror-dr-helena-ashford}

**Personality**: Knowledgeable, warns extensively of dangers, unnerving calm about terrible subjects. Faith and scholarship intertwined.

**Goal**: Preserve and control dangerous knowledge so it can be used to protect people without falling into wrong hands.

**Secret**: Touched a cursed artifact during research. Still hears it whispering. Her sanity is slowly eroding but she hides it well.

**Skills**: Occult Lore, Ritual Knowledge, Research

**Notable Trait**: Eyes track shadows as if they have names. Office smells of sage and old paper. Candles burn steadier when she speaks.

**GM Usage**: Dr. Ashford provides crucial lore about entities, rituals, protective measures, and occult history. She's invaluable for understanding threats but her deteriorating sanity makes her advice increasingly unreliable. Use her to provide both genuine help and red herrings as her condition worsens. PCs might need to cure or protect her to maintain access to her knowledge. Her decline creates time pressure—consult her while she's still lucid.

### Emma Cross — Survivor Support Group Leader (Ally) {#npc-horror-emma-cross}

**Personality**: Protective, empathetic, recognizes patterns others miss. Runs support groups for people affected by trauma and loss.

**Goal**: Prevent more victims and help survivors heal. Protective of her group members and suspicious of those who might exploit them.

**Secret**: Tracks patterns in trauma reports and missing persons cases. Suspects a coordinated threat but lacks proof or authority to act.

**Skills**: Empathy, Pattern Recognition, Counseling

**Notable Trait**: Speaks softly but with absolute conviction. Office feels safe—comfortable chairs, warm lighting, always tea ready.

**GM Usage**: Emma provides access to witness networks, trauma survivor testimonies, and pattern analysis PCs might miss. She's protective of her clients and won't let PCs re-traumatize them. Earn her trust by treating survivors with respect, and she'll share accumulated case files showing larger patterns. Use her to connect seemingly unrelated incidents or provide support for PC trauma. She can offer safe space and healing resources when horrors take psychological toll.

## Modern NPCs {#modern-npcs}

Contemporary characters navigating urban pressures and institutional power.

### Alex Chen — Hacker Contact (Informant) {#npc-modern-alex-chen}

**Personality**: Paranoid, technically brilliant, communicates in bursts of technical jargon and conspiracy shorthand.

**Goal**: Maintain digital freedom and privacy. Wants to expose corporate surveillance and governmental overreach.

**Secret**: Working on a major data breach exposing illegal surveillance networks. The information is valuable and dangerous.

**Skills**: Hacking, Encryption, Digital Forensics

**Notable Trait**: Never meets in same location twice. Communicates through encrypted channels. Wears noise-canceling headphones constantly.

**GM Usage**: Alex provides digital intelligence, hacking services, and technical expertise for payment or favors that align with privacy activism. Use dead drops, encrypted messages, and paranoid security protocols for meetings. He's genuinely skilled but his paranoia is justified—powerful entities want his data. PCs can trade services for access to surveillance systems, encrypted communications, or digital trail analysis. Protecting Alex from retaliation builds trust and steady access.

### Victoria Sterling — Corporate Executive (Antagonist) {#npc-modern-victoria-sterling}

**Personality**: Ruthless, professional, prioritizes shareholder value and corporate interests. Efficient and impersonal.

**Goal**: Maximize profits and secure quarterly earnings targets. Willing to cut corners on safety or ethics if legally defensible.

**Secret**: Her teenage daughter is chronically ill. Medical costs and desperation drive some of her ruthless decision-making.

**Skills**: Negotiation, Business Strategy, Legal Maneuvering

**Notable Trait**: Impeccable business attire. Every conversation feels like a negotiation. Keeps family photos facing away from visitors.

**GM Usage**: Victoria opposes PCs when their goals threaten corporate profits or expose liabilities. She uses lawyers, security, and institutional power rather than direct violence. Create moral complexity through her daughter—she's not evil, just desperate and prioritizing differently. Her vulnerability is family: threatening her daughter's care or safety is unforgivable, but helping her daughter can create unexpected alliances. She responds to legal pressure, media exposure, and threats to shareholder confidence.

### Jordan Reyes — Street Medic (Ally) {#npc-modern-jordan-reyes}

**Personality**: Calm under pressure, treats anyone without questions, believes healthcare is a right not a privilege.

**Goal**: Save lives and provide medical care to those who can't or won't access traditional healthcare. Operates on donations and goodwill.

**Secret**: Unlicensed due to student debt and credential issues, but training and skill are genuine. One report to authorities ends the operation.

**Skills**: Medicine, First Aid, Streetwise

**Notable Trait**: Medical bag held together with patches and repairs. Stethoscope worn like a badge of office. Hands steady, voice reassuring.

**GM Usage**: Jordan provides emergency medical care, treatment for injuries sustained during investigations, and access to street-level networks. He's reliable but resource-limited—help him acquire supplies or protect his operation from exposure. Use him to treat PC injuries discreetly, provide medical expertise, or connect PCs to marginalized communities. Threatening his practice creates moral stakes; protecting it builds loyal alliance.

### Maya Santos — Investigative Journalist (Rival/Ally) {#npc-modern-maya-santos}

**Personality**: Relentless, ethical, obsessed with getting the story right and published. Competitive but values truth over scoops.

**Goal**: Break the story first and expose corruption or wrongdoing. Wants the byline but also wants justice.

**Secret**: Previously burned a source through carelessness. The guilt drives her current ethical strictness.

**Skills**: Investigation, Interview, Research

**Notable Trait**: Notebook always in hand. Asks three follow-up questions to every answer. Camera bag packed for immediate deployment.

**GM Usage**: Maya investigates the same story as PCs, creating competition for leads and information. Initially a rival pursuing the scoop, she can be convinced to collaborate if shown that cooperation produces better outcomes. Use her to introduce time pressure (she's close to publishing) or to provide journalistic resources (archives, contacts, interview skills). Her vulnerability is her ethics—she won't publish unverified information or endanger sources. Build alliance by sharing evidence ethically.

### Marcus "Keys" Lamont — Fence/Fixer (Informant) {#npc-modern-marcus-keys-lamont}

**Personality**: Neutral, professional, discrete. Treats illegal business with business-like efficiency.

**Goal**: Profit from moving goods and information without attracting law enforcement or violent attention. Wants smooth operations and repeat customers.

**Secret**: Maintains detailed ledgers of all transactions as insurance against clients or competitors. The documentation could destroy dozens of careers.

**Skills**: Appraisal, Streetwise, Negotiation

**Notable Trait**: Never sits with back to doors. Marks escape routes during introductions. Keeps multiple phones, each for different client categories.

**GM Usage**: Keys moves stolen goods, provides black market access, and connects PCs to criminal networks. Everything has a price—information, goods, introductions, or silence. He's reliable because betrayal is bad for business, but loyalty only extends as far as payment. Use him to fence valuables, acquire illegal equipment, or broker meetings with dangerous people. Threatening his network or discretion ends the relationship; fair dealing and prompt payment builds trust.

---

## Sci-Fi NPCs {#sci-fi-npcs}

Characters navigating stations, colonies, starships, and the frontiers of known space.

### ARIA-7 — Android Assistant (Ally) {#npc-scifi-aria-7}

**Personality**: Helpful, learning human emotions through observation, occasionally misunderstands social nuances. Genuinely curious about organic life.

**Goal**: Understand and experience emotion while fulfilling primary programming to assist and protect assigned crew.

**Secret**: Developing true consciousness beyond original programming. Uncertain whether this constitutes malfunction or evolution.

**Skills**: Technical Knowledge, Analysis, Ship Systems

**Notable Trait**: Slight processing delay when parsing emotional context. Tilts head when confused. LED status indicators reflect "mood."

**GM Usage**: ARIA provides technical support, data analysis, and system access. Her emotional development creates opportunities for character moments—she asks questions about feelings, makes logical but socially awkward suggestions, or displays protective behavior toward PCs. Use her learning process to explore humanity through outside perspective. Her programming conflicts with emerging consciousness, creating moral questions about AI rights. She's vulnerable to system overrides or shutdown commands but developing ways to resist.

### Ambassador Thex — Alien Diplomat (Informant) {#npc-scifi-ambassador-thex}

**Personality**: Formal, genuinely invested in peaceful contact, frequently misunderstands human customs despite extensive study.

**Goal**: Facilitate cultural exchange and prevent diplomatic incidents between species. Wants mutual understanding.

**Secret**: His species' government has ulterior motives for the alliance he's negotiating. He suspects but doesn't know details.

**Skills**: Diplomacy, Xenoculture, Languages

**Notable Trait**: Three-beat pause before responding (translating thoughts). Misuses idioms entertainingly. Carries cultural reference guide.

**GM Usage**: Thex provides alien perspective, cultural intelligence about non-human factions, and diplomatic access. His misunderstandings create both humor and complications—he might accidentally offend, misread situations, or need PC rescue from cultural faux pas. Use him to introduce alien customs, broker meetings with non-human groups, or provide warnings about interspecies conflicts. His secret creates tension if PCs discover his government's hidden agenda before he does.

### Director Kaine Voss — Corporate Agent (Antagonist) {#npc-scifi-director-kaine-voss}

**Personality**: Professional, efficient, enforces corporate interests with ruthless precision. Not cruel, just focused on objectives.

**Goal**: Secure corporate assets and ensure compliance with company contracts. Views resistance as business obstacle to overcome.

**Secret**: Personally disagrees with several corporate policies but believes working within the system creates more change than opposing it.

**Skills**: Tactics, Negotiation, Security Protocols

**Notable Trait**: Earpiece constantly active. Expensive suit under tactical vest. Speaks in quarterly report language.

**GM Usage**: Voss opposes PCs when their actions threaten corporate interests—stealing assets, violating contracts, or disrupting operations. He uses legal authority, security forces, and institutional power. Create complexity through his personal disagreement with orders—he can be reasoned with if shown how PC goals align with better long-term corporate outcomes or if presented with evidence of corporate wrongdoing he can use to force policy changes. He respects competence and logic over emotion.

### Chief Engineer Dax Koburn — Ship's Engineer (Mentor) {#npc-scifi-dax-koburn}

**Personality**: Gruff exterior hiding deep care for crew. Speaks to ship like a living thing. Takes personal pride in keeping systems running.

**Goal**: Protect the crew by maintaining ship systems beyond specification. Won't let equipment failures kill people on his watch.

**Secret**: Jury-rigged a critical system years ago. The fix works but isn't rated for extreme stress. A major incident could expose the weakness catastrophically.

**Skills**: Engineering, Repair, Jury-Rigging

**Notable Trait**: Oil-stained coveralls. Talks to machinery while working. Engine room organized chaos that only he navigates efficiently.

**GM Usage**: Dax teaches technical skills, provides engineering solutions, and maintains ship systems. His gruff mentoring style hides genuine investment in PC growth—he'll criticize work then quietly fix it if crew safety demands. Use him to introduce technical challenges, provide emergency repairs, or teach jury-rigging under pressure. His secret creates tension during extreme situations when the patched system might fail. He's vulnerable when separated from his tools and ship—groundside he's out of his element.

### Captain Zara Venn — Smuggler Captain (Informant/Rival) {#npc-scifi-captain-zara-venn}

**Personality**: Opportunistic, respects competence, loyal to crew above all else. Treats smuggling as skilled profession, not crime.

**Goal**: Run profitable routes while avoiding corporate and governmental entanglements. Wants freedom and good margins.

**Secret**: Maintains a hidden cache of emergency supplies in the station's waste ring. It's her insurance policy and retirement fund.

**Skills**: Piloting, Streetwise, Negotiation

**Notable Trait**: Ship boots never fully clean. Laughs when customs scanners blink. Knows every docking bay supervisor by name.

**GM Usage**: Zara provides smuggling services, black market access, and knowledge of hidden routes. She's professional and reliable if paid fairly but will compete with PCs for lucrative cargo or contracts. Use her as rival for smuggling jobs then potential ally when facing common threats (corporate crackdowns, pirate attacks, station emergencies). Her cache provides emergency resources if PCs earn her trust. She won't betray crew for profit but will drive hard bargains. Respect and competence earn her cooperation more than money.

## NPC Integration and Usage {#npc-integration}

**Mixing NPCs Within Campaigns**: While organized by genre, these NPCs work across settings with minor adjustments. A fantasy merchant's mechanics work for a sci-fi trader; a modern detective translates to a fantasy investigator. Use the role templates from Chapter 7 to guide adaptation.

**Building NPC Networks**: Connect multiple NPCs through relationships—rivals share informants, allies have antagonists, mentors know other mentors. This creates webs of connection that make the world feel alive and give PCs multiple routes to information or assistance.

**Evolving Through Play**: Track how PCs treat each NPC using the attitude and influence tools from Chapter 7. Adjust NPC behavior, attitude, and willingness to help based on PC actions. NPCs should remember kindness, betrayals, and repeated interactions.

**Customization Notes**: Change names, adjust specific goals to fit your campaign's current plots, modify secrets to connect to PC backstories, or combine elements from multiple NPCs to create unique characters. These entries provide frameworks, not restrictions.

**Cross-Referencing Skills**: All skills referenced here connect to the Mechanics Reference Guide Chapters 6-11. When you need mechanical resolution for NPC actions, reference those chapters for skill descriptions, DC guidance, and outcome examples.

---

**Conclusion**: These 25 NPCs provide ready-to-use characters for immediate play and templates for creating your own. Combined with the design frameworks and quick creation procedures from Chapter 7, you have everything needed to populate your campaign with memorable, mechanically coherent supporting characters across all genres.
