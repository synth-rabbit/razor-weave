# VPC Creation & Management {#gm-vpc-creation-management}

## Table of Contents

- [VPC Roles & Knobs](./09-vpc-creation.md#vpc-roles--knobs)
- [VPC Template](./09-vpc-creation.md#vpc-template)
- [Running VPCs](./09-vpc-creation.md#running-vpcs)
- [Cross‑Links](./09-vpc-creation.md#cross-links)

## VPC Roles & Knobs {#vpc-roles--knobs}

- Mastermind (Controller/Leader): plans, delegates, escapes
- Brute (Defender/Skirmisher): pressure in space; breaks lines
- Sorcerer/Engineer (Artillery/Controller): area denial; tools and rituals

Knobs (what you can turn)

- Resources: lieutenants, gear, favors
- Space: lair tags and hazards; safe rooms, kill zones
- Attention: how widely they are known; Heat they draw

## VPC Template {#vpc-template}

- Role, Goal, Public Face, True Drive
- Knobs (list 3): what changes if each is turned
- Behavior Script (Opening, Mid, Exit)
- Counterplay: how PCs flip the script
- Exit Strategy: when they retreat, concede, or pivot

Example: The Bookkeeper (Mastermind)

- Knobs: double‑entry ledgers (resource); bribeable inspectors (attention);
  safe room under the counting house (space)
- Script: Opening — cut communications; Mid — isolate and bribe; Exit — vanish
  through a ledger‑lined false wall
- Counterplay: flip an inspector, expose the safe room via Set Up, cut funds
- Exit Strategy: concedes when exposed in public or Heat ≥4

## Running VPCs {#running-vpcs}

- Pace reveals: turn one knob at a time; show what changed
- Guard exits: the Exit Strategy is real; capture/confrontation is rare unless
  players deny the exit in fiction
- On Partial, tick pre‑stated complications (Heat, Scrutiny) and show the VPC’s
  next lever
