## Mechanics as Narrative Language {#mechanics-as-narrative-language}

Mechanics do more than simulate reality. They create dramatic tension, signal meaning, and drive
narrative forward. A clock is not just a counter; it is rising dread, approaching victory, or
accumulating consequence. A condition is not just a debuff; it is exhaustion that makes every step
harder, suspicion that poisons trust, or obligation that binds choices.

Think of mechanics as narrative language. Tags describe the fictional state and create fictional
permissions. Conditions represent character state and emotional truth. Clocks track dramatic tension
and make time visible. Resources measure cost and sacrifice. When you design or use mechanics, ask:
What does this mean in the story? What feeling does it create?

This chapter expands on GM Guide Chapter 6 (Mechanics Overview) to show how mechanics become story
tools. Rather than treating mechanics as neutral simulation, use them to reinforce genre, theme, and
tone. A mystery campaign uses tags like *Under Scrutiny* and *False Alibi*. A horror campaign uses
conditions like *Rattled* and *Traumatized*. A cozy campaign uses clocks for *Harvest Progress* and
*Festival Preparations*.

Mechanics shape player experience. Heavy resource costs create survival tension. Frequent conditions
create vulnerability and stakes. Fast-advancing clocks create urgency. Slow-advancing clocks create
long-term investment. Choose mechanics that support the experience you want at the table.

## Tags as Fiction Levers {#tags-as-fiction-levers}

Tags are narrative descriptors with mechanical weight. They establish fictional position, create
permission for actions, and provide setup for payoff moments.

**Position and Permission**: Tags define what is true in the fiction and what actions are possible.
A character with the *Renowned Duelist* tag can reasonably intimidate opponents with their
reputation. A location with *Heavily Guarded* requires stealth or deception to bypass. Tags answer
"Can I do this?" and "What is true here?"

**Metaphor and Meaning**: Tags can be literal (*Burning*, *Locked*) or metaphorical (*Cursed with
Doubt*, *Bound by Oath*). Metaphorical tags create thematic resonance. A character with *Haunted by
the Past* has mechanical disadvantage when confronting old enemies, but also narrative permission to
recall crucial memories. Tags make theme tangible.

**Setup and Payoff**: Tags created in one scene can pay off in later scenes. A player creates
*Studied the Guard Patterns* through preparation, then invokes it during infiltration for advantage.
A villain gains *Weakened Defenses* from accumulated failures, creating an opening for the final
confrontation. Tags make past actions matter.

**Invoking and Compelling**: Players invoke tags for advantage (bonus die, narrative permission,
reroll). GMs compel tags to introduce complications (the *Notorious* tag attracts unwanted
attention; the *Wounded Leg* tag prevents escape). Invocations reward clever setup. Compels create
interesting problems.

GM usage:

- Create situation tags each scene to establish fictional truth (weather, NPC moods, environmental
  hazards)
- Encourage players to create tags through preparation or clever actions
- Invoke tags to reinforce cause and effect (past actions create present advantages)
- Compel tags to introduce complications that feel fair and narratively earned
- Use metaphorical tags to reinforce campaign themes

## Conditions as Character State {#conditions-as-character-state}

Conditions represent character state: physical harm, emotional strain, social consequence, or
resource depletion. Conditions create stakes by making costs visible and accumulating pressure.

**Emotional and Social Consequences**: Conditions need not be only physical. A character can be
*Rattled* (afraid, uncertain), *Suspicious* (distrusted by allies), *Obligated* (owes a debt), or
*Exhausted* (mentally drained). Emotional and social conditions create stakes in non-combat scenes
and support genre tone.

**Accumulation and Breaking Points**: Conditions stack. A character who is *Injured* and *Exhausted*
and *Demoralized* is in serious trouble. Accumulation creates pressure and forces tough choices:
push forward at risk, or rest and lose time. Define breaking points: how many conditions before a
character cannot continue? Use breaking points to create dramatic moments (heroic last stands,
desperate gambits, necessary retreats).

**Recovery as Narrative Beat**: Recovery is not just mechanical bookkeeping; it is a narrative beat.
Resting to clear *Exhausted* is a campfire scene, a moment to reflect and bond. Clearing
*Suspicious* requires social effort, a conversation or demonstrated loyalty. Recovery creates
opportunities for character development and relationship beats.

**Condition Types by Genre**: Choose condition types that support your genre. Horror campaigns use
*Rattled*, *Traumatized*, *Paranoid*. Cozy campaigns use *Overworked*, *Flustered*, *Obligated*
(softer costs with social stakes). Political intrigue uses *Compromised*, *Indebted*, *Exposed*.
Customize conditions to create the right feel.

GM usage:

- Use emotional and social conditions alongside physical harm
- Let conditions accumulate to create pressure and hard choices
- Frame recovery as narrative beats, not just rest actions
- Customize condition names and effects to fit genre and tone
- Use breaking points to create dramatic moments and force meaningful decisions

## Clocks as Dramatic Tension {#clocks-as-dramatic-tension}

Clocks (see GM Guide Chapter 6) track progress and pressure. They make time visible, create urgency,
and turn abstract threats into tangible countdowns.

**Progress vs Pressure**: Progress clocks track player goals (*Find the Cure*, *Earn the Baron's
Trust*). Pressure clocks track threats or countdowns (*Villain's Ritual*, *Spreading Plague*,
*Collapsing Building*). Progress clocks reward momentum. Pressure clocks create urgency. Run both
simultaneously to create tension: players race progress against pressure.

**Nested Clocks**: Use nested clocks for complex situations. A *Siege of the Castle* pressure clock
contains smaller clocks for *Breach the Outer Wall*, *Supplies Depleted*, *Morale Breaks*. When a
nested clock fills, advance the parent clock. Nested clocks create layered tension and multiple
points of intervention.

**Clock Visibility**: Visible clocks create open tension. Players see the *Dragon Awakens* clock
filling and know time is running out. Hidden clocks create mystery and dread. Players sense
something is wrong but do not know how close danger is. Use visible clocks for known threats; hidden
clocks for mysteries or slow-building horror.

**Clock Pacing**: Advance clocks based on narrative logic, not rigid timekeeping. Advance pressure
clocks when players pursue other goals, when time passes in fiction, or when they ignore warnings.
Advance progress clocks when players achieve meaningful milestones. Clocks create rhythm and
consequence.

GM usage:

- Run progress clocks (player goals) and pressure clocks (threats) simultaneously
- Use nested clocks for complex situations with multiple failure points
- Make clocks visible or hidden based on desired tension type
- Advance clocks based on narrative logic and player choices
- Use clocks to pace arcs and create urgency without scripting outcomes

## Resources as Story Costs {#resources-as-story-costs}

Resources (gear, supplies, relationships, reputation, time) measure cost and sacrifice. Spending
resources creates meaningful choices. Resource depletion creates stakes and drives narrative.

**Gear and Supplies**: Physical resources (ammo, rations, tools) create survival tension. Running
low on supplies forces hard choices: ration carefully and risk failure, or spend freely and face
scarcity later. Gear as resource works best in exploration or survival campaigns. Cozy campaigns
might use supplies differently (ingredients for cooking, materials for crafting) to create
low-stakes but meaningful decisions.

**Relationships as Resources**: Relationships can be spent. Calling in a favor advances the story
but weakens the relationship. Asking an ally for help accumulates obligation. Relationships as
resources create social stakes and force players to consider long-term costs of short-term gains.

**Reputation and Influence**: Reputation is a spendable resource. Using your fame to gain access or
leverage reduces anonymity and increases scrutiny. In political or intrigue campaigns, reputation
shifts based on choices. High reputation grants access but attracts enemies. Low reputation grants
freedom but limits options.

**Time as Resource**: Time pressure turns time into a scarce resource. Players must choose how to
spend limited time: rest to recover, investigate thoroughly, or act immediately. Time as resource
creates urgency and forces prioritization. Use clocks to make time visible and spendable.

GM usage:

- Choose resource types that support campaign genre and tone
- Let resources deplete visibly; avoid infinite resources in survival or exploration campaigns
- Frame resource spending as meaningful choices with narrative cost
- Use relationships and reputation as spendable resources in social campaigns
- Make time a resource through clocks and countdowns

## Custom Mechanics for Genre and Theme {#custom-mechanics-for-genre-and-theme}

Bespoke mechanics reinforce genre and theme. Customize tags, conditions, clocks, and resources to
match your campaign's tone and focus.

**Genre-Specific Tags**: Create tags that signal genre. Horror campaigns use *Cursed*, *Haunted*,
*Forbidden Knowledge*. Cozy campaigns use *Well-Liked*, *Community Favorite*, *Master Chef*. Science
fiction uses *Quantum Entangled*, *Nanotech Enhanced*, *AI-Linked*. Genre tags create the right feel
and encourage genre-appropriate actions.

**Thematic Conditions**: Design conditions that reflect campaign themes. A campaign about debt uses
*Indebted*, *Leveraged*, *Desperate*. A campaign about identity uses *Fractured*, *Lost*,
*Transformed*. Thematic conditions make abstract themes tangible and create mechanical stakes around
theme.

**Campaign-Specific Clocks**: Create clocks for ongoing campaign threads. A rebellion campaign uses
*Popular Uprising*, *Government Crackdown*, *Safe Houses Discovered*. A mystery campaign uses
*Suspicion Grows*, *Cover Story Unravels*, *Witness Testimony Collected*. Campaign clocks make the
world feel alive and responsive.

**Custom Resources**: Invent resources that fit your setting. A magic-heavy campaign uses *Mana
Reserves* or *Spell Components*. A social intrigue campaign uses *Favors Owed* or *Blackmail
Material*. A survival campaign uses *Morale* or *Hope*. Custom resources create unique decision
points and reinforce setting flavor.

GM usage:

- Design tags, conditions, clocks, and resources that reinforce genre and theme
- Involve players in creating bespoke mechanics during Session Zero
- Test custom mechanics in early sessions; adjust based on table feel
- Avoid overloading the table with too many custom systems; start simple and add as needed
- Use custom mechanics to make themes tangible and genre expectations clear

## Worked Examples by Genre {#worked-examples-by-genre}

### Cozy: Village Harvest Festival {#cozy-village-harvest-festival}

**Genre Feel**: Community-focused, low-stakes, warm relationships, small problems with meaningful
solutions.

**Custom Mechanics**:

- **Tags**: *Beloved by Townsfolk*, *Master Baker*, *Festival Organizer*, *Overcommitted*. Tags
  emphasize social bonds and skills, not combat prowess.
- **Conditions**: *Overworked*, *Flustered*, *Obligated*, *Out of Supplies*. Conditions are social
  or logistical, not physical harm. Costs create stress but not danger.
- **Clocks**: *Festival Preparations* (progress clock, 8 segments), *Rival Village's Display*
  (pressure clock, 6 segments). Progress clock tracks community effort. Pressure clock creates
  friendly competition, not existential threat.
- **Resources**: *Festival Budget*, *Community Goodwill*, *Ingredients*, *Favors Owed*. Resources
  are spent to solve problems (hire musicians, buy decorations, call in favors for help).

**Scenario**: The village's annual Harvest Festival is in three days, but disaster strikes: the main
tent collapses in a storm, the head baker sprains their wrist, and a rival village has announced an
elaborate festival display. The party (local artisans, merchants, or visiting helpers) must rally
the community to save the festival.

**Mechanics in Action**:

- **Tags as Setup**: A player character with *Master Baker* can teach others to bake festival treats
  despite the injured baker. Another character with *Beloved by Townsfolk* can rally volunteers to
  repair the tent.
- **Conditions as Stakes**: Characters who overwork themselves gain *Overworked* (disadvantage on
  checks until they rest). Saying yes to too many requests creates *Obligated* (must fulfill
  promises or damage *Community Goodwill*).
- **Clocks as Tension**: The *Festival Preparations* progress clock advances with each successful
  effort (repairs, baking, decorations). The *Rival Village's Display* pressure clock advances each
  day, representing the rival's progress. If the progress clock fills before the festival, success.
  If the pressure clock fills first, the rival's festival outshines theirs (embarrassing but not
  catastrophic).
- **Resources as Choices**: The party spends *Festival Budget* to hire emergency labor or buy
  replacement materials. They spend *Favors Owed* to get help from neighboring farms. They spend
  *Community Goodwill* to ask for volunteers despite short notice.

**Outcome**: The mechanics create meaningful choices (spend money vs ask for favors? Prioritize
repairs vs baking?) without danger. Failures add complications (decorations are mismatched, treats
are slightly burnt) but no one is harmed. Success means a joyful festival and strengthened community
bonds. Mechanics reinforce cozy tone: stakes are real but costs are soft.

### Fantasy: The Awakening Dragon {#fantasy-the-awakening-dragon}

**Genre Feel**: Epic stakes, heroic deeds, magical wonder, escalating danger, triumph over great
evil.

**Custom Mechanics**:

- **Tags**: *Dragonslayer's Heir*, *Blessed by the Oracle*, *Ancient Rune Knowledge*, *Dragon's
  Mark* (curse or blessing). Tags emphasize heroic lineage, destiny, and magical significance.
- **Conditions**: *Seared by Dragonfire*, *Cursed*, *Magically Drained*, *Wounded*. Conditions are
  dramatic and fantastical, fitting epic stakes.
- **Clocks**: *Dragon Awakens* (pressure clock, 8 segments), *Forge the Dragon Bane Weapon*
  (progress clock, 6 segments), *Evacuate the Valley* (progress clock, 4 segments). Multiple clocks
  create layered tension: can the heroes stop the dragon before it awakens fully? Can they save
  civilians?
- **Resources**: *Ancient Lore*, *Magical Components*, *Allied Forces*, *Time*. Resources are spent
  to gain advantages (research dragon weaknesses, craft magical weapons, rally armies).

**Scenario**: An ancient dragon imprisoned beneath the mountain is awakening. Tremors shake the
land. The party must either forge a legendary weapon to slay the dragon, perform a ritual to re-seal
it, or evacuate the valley before the dragon emerges.

**Mechanics in Action**:

- **Tags as Destiny**: A character with *Dragonslayer's Heir* gains advantage when confronting the
  dragon, reinforcing heroic narrative. The tag *Ancient Rune Knowledge* allows deciphering the
  ritual to re-seal the dragon.
- **Conditions as Sacrifice**: Forging the Dragon Bane weapon requires handling volatile magic; the
  smith risks gaining *Magically Drained* or *Cursed*. Confronting the dragon early risks *Seared by
  Dragonfire*. Conditions represent heroic sacrifice.
- **Clocks as Epic Countdown**: The *Dragon Awakens* pressure clock advances each session or when
  the party pursues other goals. When it fills, the dragon emerges fully powered. The *Forge the
  Dragon Bane Weapon* progress clock advances with successful quests (gather rare materials, consult
  ancient smiths, survive magical trials). If the progress clock fills before the pressure clock,
  the party faces the dragon with advantage.
- **Resources as Heroic Effort**: The party spends *Ancient Lore* (accumulated from earlier
  sessions) to learn the dragon's weakness. They spend *Allied Forces* (rallied from nearby
  kingdoms) to evacuate civilians or create distractions. They spend *Magical Components* to empower
  the weapon or ritual.

**Outcome**: The mechanics create epic stakes and heroic tension. The countdown (dragon awakening)
is visible and urgent. The progress clocks reward proactive heroism. Conditions make confronting the
dragon costly but meaningful. Tags reinforce the fantasy of destined heroes facing mythic threats.
The final confrontation feels earned, not scripted.

### Horror: The House Remembers {#horror-the-house-remembers}

**Genre Feel**: Creeping dread, psychological strain, uncertainty, isolation, uncovering terrible
truths.

**Custom Mechanics**:

- **Tags**: *Haunted*, *Seen Too Much*, *Touched by the Other Side*, *Skeptic* (becomes a liability
  as horror escalates). Tags reflect psychological states and supernatural influence.
- **Conditions**: *Rattled*, *Traumatized*, *Paranoid*, *Corrupted*. Conditions are psychological
  and accumulate over time, creating breaking points.
- **Clocks**: *The House Awakens* (pressure clock, 6 segments, hidden from players), *Uncover the
  Truth* (progress clock, 8 segments), *Sanity* (personal countdown clocks, 4 segments per
  character). Hidden pressure clock creates dread. Sanity clocks create personal stakes.
- **Resources**: *Trust* (between party members), *Supplies* (light sources, tools), *Sanity*
  (personal resource spent to resist fear or push through horror).

**Scenario**: The party investigates an abandoned house where several people disappeared. The house
is not just haunted; it is alive, sentient, and malevolent. The longer they stay, the more the house
influences them. They must uncover the truth (what happened here? Why does the house hunger?) and
escape before the house claims them.

**Mechanics in Action**:

- **Tags as Psychological States**: A character gains *Seen Too Much* after witnessing a traumatic
  event (ghostly manifestation, corpse discovery). The tag grants insight into supernatural events
  but compels them to act recklessly or freeze in fear. The *Skeptic* tag initially protects against
  fear but becomes a compel when evidence mounts (denial prevents rational action).
- **Conditions as Breaking Points**: Each frightening encounter risks adding a condition: *Rattled*
  (disadvantage on checks), *Paranoid* (distrust allies, see threats everywhere), *Traumatized*
  (flashbacks, panic). Accumulating conditions creates a spiral: fear makes characters less
  effective, leading to more failures and more fear. At four conditions, a character reaches a
  breaking point: they flee, collapse, or are claimed by the house.
- **Clocks as Creeping Dread**: The hidden *The House Awakens* pressure clock advances when players
  linger, split up, or disturb certain areas. Players do not see it but feel its effects (lights
  fail, doors lock, whispers grow louder). When it fills, the house manifests fully and hunting
  begins. The *Uncover the Truth* progress clock advances with successful investigation: finding
  journals, interpreting symbols, confronting ghosts. Progress rewards courage but takes time,
  advancing pressure.
- **Resources as Desperation**: *Trust* between party members depletes when paranoia takes hold or
  when characters act suspiciously. Low trust creates tension: are we safe together? *Supplies*
  (flashlights, batteries, tools) deplete through use and loss. Running out of light in a dark house
  is terrifying. *Sanity* can be spent to resist fear checks but runs out, forcing eventual breaking
  points.

**Outcome**: The mechanics create psychological horror. Conditions accumulate, creating a death
spiral. The hidden pressure clock creates dread: something is happening, but players do not know how
close they are to disaster. Scarcity (light, supplies, sanity) creates vulnerability. Trust as a
resource creates interpersonal tension. Success means uncovering the truth and escaping before the
house claims them, but at cost: characters are changed, traumatized, or lost.

### Modern: Corporate Espionage {#modern-corporate-espionage}

**Genre Feel**: High-stakes intrigue, social maneuvering, time pressure, technology and deception,
contemporary consequences.

**Custom Mechanics**:

- **Tags**: *Insider Access*, *Digital Forensics Expert*, *Under Surveillance*, *Blackmail
  Material*. Tags reflect modern skills, access, and complications.
- **Conditions**: *Exposed*, *Compromised*, *Burned* (cover blown), *Exhausted*. Conditions are
  professional and social consequences.
- **Clocks**: *Acquire the Prototype* (progress clock, 6 segments), *Security Audit* (pressure
  clock, 8 segments), *Corporate Suspicion* (pressure clock, 4 segments). Progress tracks the heist.
  Pressure tracks tightening security and rising suspicion.
- **Resources**: *Cover Identity*, *Hacking Tools*, *Insider Contacts*, *Time*. Resources are spent
  to bypass security, gather intel, or create distractions.

**Scenario**: The party (freelance operatives or rival corporate agents) must infiltrate a tech
corporation and steal a prototype device before it is moved to a secure facility in 72 hours.
Security is tight, surveillance is everywhere, and any mistake risks exposure.

**Mechanics in Action**:

- **Tags as Access and Risk**: *Insider Access* allows bypassing certain security (posing as
  employees, using stolen badges). *Digital Forensics Expert* grants advantage on hacking checks.
  *Under Surveillance* is a compel: security is watching, limiting risky actions. *Blackmail
  Material* can be invoked to coerce cooperation from an NPC but risks creating enemies.
- **Conditions as Professional Consequences**: *Exposed* means the character's face is flagged in
  security systems (must avoid cameras, change disguise). *Compromised* means an asset or contact is
  burned (loses access to resources). *Burned* means cover identity is blown (must operate in the
  open or flee). Conditions escalate consequences and force adaptation.
- **Clocks as Ticking Deadline**: *Acquire the Prototype* progress clock advances with successful
  infiltration steps (gain access, bypass security, locate prototype, extract). *Security Audit*
  pressure clock advances with time passing or when players trip alarms. When it fills, security
  protocols tighten (extra guards, locked doors, surveillance intensifies). *Corporate Suspicion*
  pressure clock advances when players are sloppy or unlucky. When it fills, the corporation knows
  someone is targeting them and moves the prototype early.
- **Resources as Tools and Risks**: *Hacking Tools* can be spent to bypass digital locks but risk
  detection (failed checks alert security). *Insider Contacts* provide intel or access but are
  finite; calling the same contact too often risks burning them. *Cover Identity* is a resource:
  each use risks exposure (checks to maintain cover under scrutiny).

**Outcome**: The mechanics create tense, high-stakes espionage. Clocks create urgency: the window is
closing. Conditions escalate risk: exposure forces improvisation. Resources are finite: every tool
used is a risk-reward decision. Tags provide capabilities but also vulnerabilities (surveillance,
blackmail). Success means stealing the prototype before time runs out and escaping without being
identified. Failure means getting caught, burned, or outmaneuvered by corporate security.

### Science Fiction: Station Breach Protocol {#science-fiction-station-breach-protocol}

**Genre Feel**: High-tech problem solving, vacuum and decompression danger, alien or AI threats,
isolated setting, survival and ingenuity.

**Custom Mechanics**:

- **Tags**: *Vacuum Sealed*, *AI-Linked*, *Radiation Exposure*, *Engineering Genius*, *Alien
  Contamination*. Tags blend tech, danger, and sci-fi competencies.
- **Conditions**: *Hypoxia*, *Irradiated*, *Contaminated*, *Systems Failure*. Conditions reflect
  sci-fi dangers: environmental hazards, equipment failure, contamination.
- **Clocks**: *Restore Life Support* (progress clock, 8 segments), *Hull Integrity* (pressure clock,
  6 segments), *Contamination Spread* (pressure clock, 4 segments). Progress tracks survival
  efforts. Pressure tracks escalating crises.
- **Resources**: *Oxygen*, *Power Cells*, *Repair Materials*, *Suits*. Resources are life-or-death:
  running out of oxygen or power means immediate danger.

**Scenario**: The space station suffers catastrophic damage: hull breach, life support failing,
possible alien contamination in one sector. The crew (player characters) must restore life support,
seal the breach, and contain contamination before oxygen runs out or the station tears apart.

**Mechanics in Action**:

- **Tags as Sci-Fi Abilities and Dangers**: *AI-Linked* allows interfacing with station systems
  remotely, granting advantages on tech checks. *Engineering Genius* allows improvising repairs with
  limited materials. *Vacuum Sealed* means a section is safe from decompression but isolated. *Alien
  Contamination* is a compel: exposure risks infection or worse.
- **Conditions as Environmental Threats**: *Hypoxia* (oxygen deprivation) accumulates in
  depressurized areas, creating disadvantage and eventual collapse. *Irradiated* comes from
  proximity to damaged reactor, requiring treatment or worsening over time. *Contaminated* results
  from exposure to alien material, creating unknown dangers (mutation? Mind control? Spreading
  infection?). *Systems Failure* applies to equipment: suits, tools, doors, all vulnerable to
  malfunction.
- **Clocks as Multiple Crises**: *Restore Life Support* progress clock advances with successful
  engineering checks (reroute power, repair oxygen scrubbers, restart systems). *Hull Integrity*
  pressure clock advances with time or structural stress (explosions, failed repairs). When it
  fills, the station begins to tear apart (sections decompress, crew must evacuate). *Contamination
  Spread* pressure clock advances when the alien material is disturbed or ignored. When it fills,
  contamination reaches critical systems (life support, bridge) and becomes uncontainable.
- **Resources as Survival**: *Oxygen* is tracked per character or per suit. Limited oxygen creates
  urgency and forces hard choices (who goes into vacuum? How long can we stay?). *Power Cells* run
  equipment: tools, doors, lights. Running out of power means working in darkness and manually
  overriding systems. *Repair Materials* are scarce: duct tape, welding supplies, spare parts.
  Improvising repairs risks failure. *Suits* are limited and can malfunction (*Systems Failure*
  condition), creating vulnerability.

**Outcome**: The mechanics create sci-fi survival tension. Multiple pressure clocks create cascading
crises: fix one problem while others worsen. Resources are life-or-death: oxygen and power are time
limits. Conditions reflect environmental dangers: vacuum, radiation, contamination. Tags grant
sci-fi capabilities (AI interfacing, engineering genius) but also vulnerabilities (contamination,
system dependency). Success means restoring life support, sealing the breach, and containing
contamination before catastrophic failure. Failure means evacuation, loss of the station, or worse
(contamination spreads, crew is lost).
