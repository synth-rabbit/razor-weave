## Improvisation Techniques {#improvisation-techniques}

Build from player intent; treat your prep as levers, not scripts.

Patterns

- Yes‑And with Costs: accept the idea; add a cost or complication
- Reframe: reduce a stuck plan to a smaller objective and ask again
- Reveal a Lever: show a tag/condition/clock that can change the situation
- Fronts: list 3 forces with goals/timers; ask which advances now

GM usage

- Name what success looks like; pre‑state Partial/Fail; then play to find out
- Keep a page of names/roles/tags to slot quickly when you need an NPC/scene

## Running Intrigue & Mystery {#running-intrigue--mystery}

Information is a resource, not a wall. Let clues point to more than one place;
let clocks and suspicion track risk, not “fail or stop.”

Tools

- Clue Triangle: each scene points to two other leads; progress even on Partials
- Suspicion Clocks: pre‑state what fills them; show what scrutiny changes
- Heat & Attention: carry between scenes; offer ways to reduce

GM usage

- On Full: give clarity and a new lead; tick progress
- On Partial: give a messy lead and tick Suspicion/Heat 1
- On Fail: escalate attention; reveal a complication or rival force

## Advanced Pacing & Spotlight {#advanced-pacing--spotlight}

- Beats & Montages: compress unimportant steps; expand key choices
- Nested Clocks: a set piece can have a progress clock and multiple pressures
- Popcorn + Anchors: choose who acts next; anchor key beats (defenses/escapes)
- Spotlight Rescue: if someone is quiet, point to a lever they can use now

GM usage

- Close on a change in state; summarize and ask again
- Alternate pressure across the party; avoid piling everything on one PC

## Safety & Tone Management {#safety--tone-management}

Calibrate at session zero, then maintain in play.

Checklist

- Lines/Veils reminders; check tone if a beat feels off
- Recap without graphic detail; consent before revisiting sensitive content
- Use safety tools (pause/rewind) without penalty to players

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

Common stalls and fixes

- Analysis Paralysis: reframe to two options; put a gentle timer on the scene
- Runaway Plan: call out pressure and risk; ask what they’re willing to pay
- Missed Hook: reintroduce via a different lever (new NPC, tag, or clock)
