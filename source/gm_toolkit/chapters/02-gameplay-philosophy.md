## Why Principles Matter {#why-principles-matter}

Principles help you adjudicate quickly and fairly. They keep play moving,
prevent stalls, and make outcomes feel earned. Use them as tiebreakers when the
rules have multiple valid readings, and as prompts when the table hesitates.
Stated out loud, they calibrate expectations so players know what success and
costs look like before dice hit the table.

## The Principles {#the-principles}

- Make Stakes Visible: Say what Full/Partial/Fail mean before rolling. Players
  commit more boldly when they can see outcomes.
- Fail Forward: On a failure, change the situation (time, position, attention,
  resources) instead of stopping the story. New problems beat dead ends.
- Fiction First, Numbers Follow: Let tags, conditions, and position drive DCs
  and advantage—not the other way around.
- Progress and Pressure: Use paired clocks so effort makes headway even under
  threat. Partial success often ticks pressure you pre‑stated.
- Spotlight is a Resource: Order and pacing should give everyone meaningful
  moments. Invite action and rotate cleanly.
- State Changes, Not Gotchas: When mechanics bite, show the lever to clear or
  mitigate (aid, retreat, first aid, time). Pain is interesting when it creates
  choices.

## Applying Principles {#applying-principles}

Exploration (Fog and Time): Pre‑state “Full crosses 2; Partial crosses 1 and
ticks Patrol 1; Fail ticks Patrol 2.” Tags like Dim can grant advantage to
stealth while raising DCs for navigation. On Partial, you still move forward.

Social (Leverage and Cost): Pre‑state “Full: clean approval; Partial: approval
with strings; Fail: scrutiny rises.” If the room is Crowded, increase DCs until
someone creates space (Set Up). Costs change future checks, not player agency.

Combat (Space and Pressure): Pre‑state beats for Set Up/Strike/Maneuver.
Partial fills Reinforcements you telegraphed; Full degrades cover or advances
the objective. Make the lever to reset (Withdraw, Clear) obvious.

Downtime (Projects and Heat): Every pass advances a project clock. On Partial,
advance a complication you named beforehand (Heat 1). Provide ways to reduce
complications if players choose to address them.

## Common Pitfalls {#common-pitfalls}

- Hidden DCs and Surprise Costs: If players can’t predict outcomes, they can’t
  make informed choices. Pre‑state stakes and why DCs look the way they do.
- Binary Gates: Avoid “try again later” without change. Ask what would change
  the situation—then play that change.
- Pacing Drift: Long turns and empty narration drain tension. Keep loop passes
  tight and close on change.
