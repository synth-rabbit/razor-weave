# GM Cheat Sheet

Essential quick reference for running sessions.

---

## Core GM Principles

**Fiction First**: Start with narrative, then determine mechanics
**Yes, And**: Build on player ideas whenever possible
**Fail Forward**: Failure creates complications, not dead ends
**Spotlight Management**: Share focus among all players
**Transparency**: Share DCs and consequences before rolls when appropriate

---

## Setting DCs

| Difficulty | DC | When to Use |
|------------|----|----|
| **Easy** | 6 | Routine task, favorable conditions, PC has advantage |
| **Moderate** | 8 | Standard challenge for competent character |
| **Challenging** | 10 | Difficult but achievable, requires skill or luck |
| **Hard** | 12 | Requires expertise, unfavorable conditions |
| **Very Hard** | 14 | Near-impossible, only masters succeed |
| **Heroic** | 16+ | Legendary feat, cinematic moment |

**Quick DC Formula**: 8 + (number of complications or risk factors)

**Modifiers**:
- **+2**: Time pressure, poor conditions, active opposition
- **-2**: Preparation, ideal tools, favorable circumstances
- **Advantage**: Perfect setup, ally assistance, clever approach
- **Disadvantage**: Rushed, injured, improvised tools

---

## Check Results

**10+**: **Full Success** - PC gets what they want, no cost
- Describe awesome outcome
- Move story forward positively
- Consider granting bonus (advantage on follow-up, useful intel)

**7-9**: **Partial Success** - Success with cost or complication
- PC succeeds at goal BUT:
  - Takes damage or condition
  - Uses up resource
  - Creates new complication
  - Alerts enemy or loses advantage
  - Must choose between two outcomes

**6 or less**: **Failure** - Doesn't achieve goal, story complication
- Situation worsens
- Enemy acts or advances clock
- New problem emerges
- PC learns something valuable (silver lining)
- **Never**: Nothing happens (boring!)

---

## Combat Quick Reference

### Action Economy
- PCs get **2 actions per turn**
- Common actions: Move, Attack, Defend, Use Item, Help, Special
- Reactions: Dodge, Counter, Protect (interrupt enemies)

### Damage & Health
- **PC Health**: Tier × 10 (Tier 1 = 10 HP, Tier 2 = 20 HP, etc.)
- **NPC/Enemy Health**: Abstract (Minion = 1-5 HP, Elite = 10-20 HP, Boss = 30+ HP)
- **Damage**: Successful attack = 1d6 + weapon/skill
- **Deadly**: Full damage to 0 HP in one hit = risk of death

### Combat Flow
1. **Establish Fiction**: Describe scene, positions, threats
2. **Determine Initiative**: Quick (PCs act), Slow (enemies act first), or negotiate
3. **Run Turns**: Players describe actions → GM determines mechanic → resolve
4. **Complications**: Use partial successes to create dynamic combat
5. **End When Narratively Resolved**: Not when all enemies at 0 HP

---

## NPC Quick Creation (5-Minute)

**Name**: Pick or generate
**Role**: Ally, Rival, Mentor, Antagonist, Informant
**One Trait**: Distinctive personality feature
**One Goal**: What they want right now
**One Secret** (optional): Hidden motivation or fact

**Skills** (if needed): 1-3 relevant skills at +1 or +2

---

## Enemy Quick Stats

### Minions (Tier 1)
- **HP**: 3-5
- **Skills**: 1-2 at +0 to +1
- **Tactics**: Swarm, simple attacks, flee when threatened

### Elites (Tier 2-3)
- **HP**: 10-20
- **Skills**: 3-4 at +1 to +2
- **Tactics**: Coordinate, use terrain, exploit weaknesses

### Bosses (Tier 3-5)
- **HP**: 30-50
- **Skills**: 4-6 at +2 to +3
- **Tactics**: Adapt, use legendary actions, stage-based fight

---

## Clocks & Progress

**Clocks Track**:
- Enemy plans advancing
- Environmental threats
- Gradual outcomes (investigation, travel, social campaign)

**Clock Sizes**:
- **4-segment**: Quick/simple progress
- **6-segment**: Standard challenge
- **8-segment**: Major undertaking
- **10-12-segment**: Campaign-scale goal

**Advancing Clocks**:
- PC success → fill player-beneficial clock
- PC failure → fill threat clock
- Time passing → advance background clocks

---

## Improvisation Quick Prompts

**When you don't know what happens next**:
1. **Ask players**: "What are you hoping to find?"
2. **Complicate**: Add obstacle to what they expect
3. **Reveal secret**: Answer a mystery or introduce new one
4. **Advance clock**: Move enemy/faction plan forward
5. **Introduce NPC**: New ally, rival, or complication

**When players go off-script**:
1. **Embrace it**: Build on their idea
2. **Ask questions**: "How do you know that?" "What makes you think that?"
3. **Call for check**: Let dice determine unexpected outcomes
4. **Take a break**: "Let me think about this for a moment"

## Pacing Guide

**Scene Length**:
- **Action**: 15-30 minutes
- **Social**: 20-40 minutes
- **Exploration**: 15-30 minutes
- **Downtime**: 10-15 minutes

**Session Structure** (3-4 hour session):
1. **Opening** (15 min): Recap, establish stakes
2. **Rising Action** (90 min): 2-3 scenes building tension
3. **Climax** (45 min): Major confrontation or revelation
4. **Falling Action** (30 min): Consequences, rewards, setup next session

**Signs of Drag**:
- Players checking phones
- Off-topic conversation
- Decision paralysis
- Repetitive actions

**Pace-Up Tools**:
- Fast-forward through routine
- Call for group checks
- Introduce time pressure
- Advance threat clock

---

## Spotlight Management

**Every 30 minutes, check**:
- Has everyone had a meaningful action?
- Is one player dominating?
- Is anyone disengaged?

**Balance Tools**:
- **Direct questions**: "Kira, what's your character thinking?"
- **Split party briefly**: Give quiet player solo moment
- **Leverage backstories**: Create hooks for specific PCs
- **Varied challenges**: Combat for fighters, social for faces, etc.

## Common GM Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Over-planning**: Prep situations, not plots
❌ **Saying "no" reflexively**: Default to "yes, and" or "yes, but"
❌ **Fudging dice secretly**: Players notice and trust erodes
❌ **Ignoring consequences**: Failures must matter
❌ **Rushing emotional moments**: Let victories and defeats breathe
❌ **GM vs. Players mentality**: You're collaborators, not opponents

---

## When Things Go Wrong

**Player conflict**: Call break, discuss privately, establish boundaries
**Rules dispute**: Make quick ruling, note to look up later, move on
**Derailed plot**: Embrace it, your prep isn't wasted (repurpose later)
**TPK risk**: Telegraph danger clearly, offer retreat options
**Bored players**: End scene early, skip to interesting choice
**You make mistake**: Acknowledge, correct if necessary, continue

---

## Emergency Session Prep (15 Minutes)

1. **Opening hook** (1 min): One urgent problem
2. **Three NPCs** (3 min): Names, goals, traits
3. **Two locations** (2 min): Where scenes might occur
4. **One secret** (1 min): Hidden info that can be revealed
5. **Threat clock** (1 min): What's getting worse
6. **List of names** (1 min): For improvising NPCs
7. **Treasure/rewards** (1 min): What PCs might gain
8. **Cliffhanger** (1 min): How session might end

**Rely on players**: Ask questions, build on their ideas, improvise together
