# Pacing Guide by Genre

Genre-specific guidance for session pacing and rhythm.

---

## Universal Pacing Principles

### Basic Session Structure
**3-Act Structure** (for 3-4 hour session):
- **Act 1** (30-45 min): Hook, setup, complications
- **Act 2** (90-120 min): Rising action, challenges, developments
- **Act 3** (30-45 min): Climax, resolution, cliffhanger

### Scene Types
- **Action**: High energy, fast-paced, immediate stakes
- **Investigation**: Moderate pace, discovery, problem-solving
- **Social**: Variable pace, character interaction, relationship building
- **Downtime**: Slow pace, recovery, reflection

### Pacing Tools
- **Clocks**: Create urgency and track progress
- **Cuts**: Skip boring parts, montage routine tasks
- **Cliffhangers**: End scenes/sessions on tension
- **Breathers**: Allow recovery between intense moments

## Cross-Genre Pacing Techniques

### Managing Energy
**High energy burns out** - Use 60/40 rule:
- 60% moderate pace

### Time Pressure
**Use sparingly** - Constant urgency exhausts:

- Fantasy: Some quests, not all
- Horror: Selectively for tension
- Modern: Common but with breaks
- Sci-Fi: Situational

### Cliffhanger Guidelines
**Good cliffhangers**:
- Revelation with implications
- Choice presented
- Danger arrives
- Unexpected twist

**Bad cliffhangers**:
- Mid-combat
- Arbitrary stopping
- Withholding for no reason
- Punishing players

### Scene Length Guidelines
- **Short scenes** (5-10 min): Quick cuts, transitions, montages
- **Medium scenes** (15-30 min): Standard encounters, investigations
- **Long scenes** (30-60 min): Major combats, complex social, climaxes
