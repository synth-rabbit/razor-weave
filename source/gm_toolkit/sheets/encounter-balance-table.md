## Opponent Strength Definitions

### Weak Opponents
- **HP**: 1-3
- **Skills**: +0 to +1
- **Threat**: Can be defeated in 1-2 hits
- **Examples**: Minions, goblins, thugs, animals

### Equal Opponents
- **HP**: Similar to PCs (Tier 1: 8-12, Tier 2: 12-16, etc.)
- **Skills**: Similar to PCs (+1 to +3)
- **Threat**: Can trade blows effectively
- **Examples**: Rivals, soldiers, competent enemies

### Stronger Opponents

### Boss/Legendary Opponents

- **Skills**: +4 to +6
- **Special**: Multiple actions, resistances, unique abilities
- **Threat**: Designed for entire party to fight
- **Examples**: Campaign villains, dragons, major threats

---

## Action Economy Balancing

**Key Principle**: More actions per round = more dangerous

### Modifying for Action Economy

**Outnumbered Party** (enemies have 2x actions):
- Reduce enemy skills by 1
- OR reduce enemy HP by 25%
- OR add environmental advantages for PCs

**Outnumbered Enemies** (PCs have 2x actions):
- Increase enemy skills by 1
- OR increase enemy HP by 25%
- OR add environmental advantages for enemies

**Solo Boss** (1 vs many):
- Give 2-3 actions per round
- OR legendary reactions
- OR minions to absorb actions

---

## Environmental Factors

**Add +1 difficulty level when**:
- Enemies have cover/high ground
- Hazardous terrain for PCs
- Environmental threats (fire, traps)
- Time pressure
- Limited resources

**Reduce 1 difficulty level when**:
- PCs have cover/high ground
- Environmental advantages
- Prep time and planning
- Perfect information
- Ideal resources

---

## Combat by Genre

### Cozy
- Focus on defense/protection rather than killing
- Lower HP, more about resolve/stamina
- Winning = driving off, not defeating
- Consequences = exhaustion, worry, not death

### Fantasy
- Traditional dungeon encounters
- Magic balancing considerations
- Legendary creatures as bosses
- Epic scale at higher tiers

### Horror/Mystery
- Outnumbered, dangerous enemies
- Escape often better than fight
- Single creature can be deadly
- Atmosphere > balance

### Modern
- Cover and positioning critical
- Firearms = high damage
- Small numbers, high lethality
- Tactical > brute force

### Sci-Fi
- Ship combat vs personal combat
- Technology = force multiplier
- Environmental hazards (space, radiation)
- Scale varies wildly

## Quick Encounter Builder

**Step 1**: Determine difficulty (Easy/Moderate/Hard/Deadly)

**Step 2**: Note party size and tier

**Step 3**: Reference table above for opponent count

**Step 4**: Adjust for:
- Environment
- Genre
- Story context
- Resource availability

**Step 5**: Add interest:
- Environmental features
- Objectives beyond "defeat all enemies"
- Complications mid-combat
- Escape options

---

## Balancing Non-Combat Encounters

### Social Encounters
- **Easy**: Friendly NPC, clear goal
- **Moderate**: Neutral NPC, competing interests
- **Hard**: Hostile NPC, complex negotiation
- **Deadly**: Multiple hostile NPCs, high stakes

### Exploration Challenges
- **Easy**: One obstacle, obvious solution
- **Moderate**: Multiple obstacles OR hidden solution
- **Hard**: Multiple obstacles AND time pressure
- **Deadly**: Cascading failures, limited resources

### Mystery/Investigation
- **Easy**: Clues obvious, NPCs helpful
- **Moderate**: Some hidden clues, mixed cooperation
- **Hard**: Clues obscure, active opposition
- **Deadly**: Misinformation, time limit, stakes

---

## Adjusting on the Fly

**If encounter too easy**:
- Reinforcements arrive
- Environmental complication
- Enemy gets advantage
- Objective changes (protect something, stop ritual)

**If encounter too hard**:
- Allies arrive to help
- Environmental aid (cover, escape route)
- Enemy makes mistake
- Partial victory option

---

## Daily Encounter Budget

**Encounters per session by tier**:

**Tier 1**: 2-3 moderate OR 1 hard + 1 easy  
**Tier 2**: 3-4 moderate OR 2 hard + 1 easy  
**Tier 3**: 4-5 moderate OR 2-3 hard  
**Tier 4**: 5+ moderate OR 3-4 hard OR 1 deadly

**Between long rests**: Scale up by 2-3x

**Important**: Include short rests between encounters!

---

## Encounter Variety

**Balance across session**:
- Not all combat
- Mix easy/moderate/hard
- Different types (combat/social/exploration)
- Pacing (tension/release)

**Avoid**:
- All encounters same difficulty
- No breaks between fights
- Grinding through identical encounters
- Predictable patterns
