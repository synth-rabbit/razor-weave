## Integration Considerations

### Potential Overlap Between GM Guide & Storyteller Guide

**To Review and Deduplicate**:
1. **Improvisation Content**:
   - GM Guide Ch. 05: Scene Structure (includes improv)
   - Storyteller Guide Ch. 09 → Ch. 27: Improvisation Techniques
   - **Action**: Consolidate or cross-reference, keep detailed version

2. **Campaign Content**:
   - GM Guide Ch. 14: Storytelling Fundamentals
   - Storyteller Guide Ch. 06 → Ch. 24: Campaign Frameworks
   - **Action**: Review for duplication, merge if necessary

3. **Genre Guides**:
   - GM Guide Ch. 15: Worldbuilding Toolkit (genre-agnostic)
   - Storyteller Guide Ch. 13-15 → Ch. 31-33: Genre-specific campaigns
   - **Action**: Ensure complementarity (general worldbuilding vs genre-specific)

4. **Session Zero**:
   - May appear in GM Guide implicitly
   - Storyteller Guide Ch. 08 → Ch. 26: Session Zero
   - **Action**: Keep Storyteller version as primary reference

**Deduplication Strategy**:
- Keep more detailed/comprehensive version
- Add cross-reference from shorter version
- Consolidate only if truly redundant
- Preserve distinct perspectives (GM mechanics vs narrative/story)
