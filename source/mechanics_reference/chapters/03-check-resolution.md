# Check Resolution and Outcomes {#check-resolution}

This chapter details the procedures for resolving checks and contests, interpreting outcomes across different genres, and handling special cases that arise during play.

## Rolling Procedures {#rolling-procedures}

### When to Roll {#when-to-roll}

Call for a roll when all three conditions are true:

1. **Uncertainty**: The outcome is not predetermined. A trained character performing a routine task in ideal conditions does not roll.
2. **Consequence**: Failure introduces complications or costs. If failure just means "try again," don't roll—either the task succeeds with time, or it's impossible.
3. **Agency**: The character has meaningful influence over the outcome. Don't roll for things completely outside the character's control.

**GM Guidance**: Default to "say yes" when possible. Reserve rolls for moments of tension, risk, or meaningful choice. A baker character making simple bread does not roll Baking unless the stakes are high (festival competition, royal banquet, limited ingredients).

### When Not to Roll {#when-not-to-roll}

Skip the roll in these situations:

- **Trivial Tasks**: A skilled character performing basic tasks in their specialty. A character with Thievery doesn't roll to unlock a simple door with proper tools and time.
- **Impossible Tasks**: No amount of luck makes this achievable. Don't ask for a roll if failure is the only option—just say "no, and here's why."
- **No Consequences**: Nothing changes whether they succeed or fail. If they can keep trying indefinitely, resolve it as a time cost instead.

**Example (Cozy)**: A gardener character wants to plant vegetables. This is routine for them, so no roll. If they want to cure a mysterious blight threatening the harvest, that's uncertain and consequential—roll Gardening, DC 16.

**Example (Sci-fi)**: A starship pilot wants to dock at a station in calm conditions. Routine, no roll. If they're docking during a debris storm while pursued, that's uncertain and consequential—roll Starship Piloting, DC 18.

## Interpreting Results by Outcome Tier {#interpreting-results}

Each outcome tier should drive the fiction forward in genre-appropriate ways.

### Success {#success-interpretation}

You achieve your goal cleanly. No compromises, no costs. The lock opens, the crowd believes you, the ship docks safely. Success means progress.

**Fantasy Example**: Sneaking through a dungeon (Stealth, DC 16). Success means you reach your destination undetected. Guards remain unaware. You control the next moment.

**Horror Example**: Investigating a crime scene (Investigation, DC 16). Success reveals critical clues—the murder weapon, timeline inconsistencies, a hidden witness. You have actionable leads.

**Modern Example**: Hacking a secure system (Hacking, DC 18). Success grants access and covers your tracks. The system shows no evidence of intrusion.

### Partial Success {#partial-interpretation}

You achieve your goal but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect. Partials keep momentum while maintaining tension. Frame them as "yes, but":

- **Cost**: You succeed but expend resources, tools, time, or goodwill.
- **Complication**: You succeed but create a new problem or advance a threat clock.
- **Lesser Effect**: You achieve part of your goal or temporary success.

**Fantasy Example**: Picking a lock (Thievery, DC 16). Partial means the lock opens, but your tools break. You'll need new tools before attempting similar tasks.

**Horror Example**: Calming a panicked witness (Psychology, DC 14). Partial means they calm enough to talk, but they're fixated on you now. They'll seek you out repeatedly, demanding reassurance.

**Modern Example**: Negotiating a crisis (Negotiation, DC 18). Partial means the immediate threat de-escalates, but you made promises you'll need to keep. Those promises will complicate future scenes.

### Failure {#failure-interpretation}

You don't achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. Frame failures as "no, and":

- **No Progress**: The goal remains unachieved.
- **Complication**: A new problem emerges—threats advance, resources diminish, positions worsen.

Failures should never be dead ends. They introduce new choices and shift the situation.

**Fantasy Example**: Convincing a hostile duke (Persuasion, DC 20). Failure means he not only refuses, but now views you as a threat. Guards escort you out, and your access to the court is revoked.

**Horror Example**: Evading a pursuer in fog (Stealth, DC 16). Failure means they track you to your safehouse. Now they know where you're hiding, and you must flee or fortify.

**Sci-fi Example**: Repairing a failing life support system (Systems Engineering, DC 18). Failure means the system continues failing. You have one more scene before the air runs out, and you'll need a different approach or outside help.

## Group Checks {#group-checks}

When multiple characters work toward a shared goal, use group checks to streamline resolution:

**Procedure**:
1. Identify the leader—the character most qualified or driving the effort.
2. The leader rolls the check against the DC.
3. Each assistant can provide advantage by contributing meaningfully. Describe how they help.
4. Assistants share in the consequences of Partials and Failures.

**GM Guidance**: Limit assistants to those who can contribute meaningfully. Don't let every character help with a Hacking check if only one has the skill. Assistants take on risk—if the check results in a Partial or Failure, they share the cost.

**Fantasy Example**: A party climbs a cliff (Athletics, DC 16). The strongest character leads. Another character with rope provides advantage. On a Partial, both characters reach the top, but the rope frays and will break if used again.

**Cozy Example**: Organizing a village festival (Event Planning, DC 16). The character with the skill leads. Assistants provide advantage by rallying volunteers. On a Partial, the festival happens, but one volunteer group feels overworked and harbors resentment.

**Modern Example**: Coordinating a rescue operation (Logistics, DC 18). The logistics expert leads. Field operatives provide advantage by scouting routes. On a Failure, the operation is delayed, and the rescue window narrows.

## Contests {#contests}

Contests resolve direct opposition between characters or NPCs. Both sides roll relevant skills. Higher result wins.

**Procedure**:
1. Identify the opposing skills. Both parties roll.
2. Compare results. Higher roll wins.
3. Calculate margin: winner's roll minus loser's roll.
4. Interpret margin narratively:
   - **Margin 1-3**: Narrow victory. You succeed, but barely.
   - **Margin 4-6**: Clear victory. You succeed convincingly.
   - **Margin 7+**: Decisive victory. You dominate completely.

**Ties**: Both achieve Partial outcomes. Neither gets what they wanted cleanly. Introduce complications for both sides or escalate the situation.

**Fantasy Example**: Two knights joust (Athletics contest). Knight A rolls 19, Knight B rolls 14. Margin of 5. Knight A lands a clear hit, unseating Knight B without injury. Knight A wins the round decisively.

**Horror Example**: A detective and killer play a game of cat-and-mouse (Investigation vs Stealth contest). Detective rolls 17, Killer rolls 18. Margin of 1. The killer evades detection by a hair, leaving behind a tantalizing clue that taunts the detective.

**Sci-fi Example**: Two ships race through an asteroid field (Starship Piloting contest). Pilot A rolls 16, Pilot B rolls 16. Tie. Both ships navigate successfully but dangerously close to collision. A debris cloud now separates them, forcing new tactical decisions.

## Edge Cases {#edge-cases}

### Critical Success {#critical-success}

Some tables use critical success (rolling maximum on the die) for exceptional outcomes. This is optional.

**If Using Criticals**: A critical success achieves the goal with an additional benefit—extra effect, bonus information, or eliminating a threat. Keep it narrative and avoid power creep.

**Example**: A critical success on Hacking not only breaches the system but also plants evidence implicating someone else, misdirecting any investigation.

### Critical Failure {#critical-failure}

Similarly, critical failure (rolling minimum on the die) can introduce dramatic complications. This is also optional.

**If Using Criticals**: A critical failure introduces a severe complication beyond normal failure—broken tools, injury, or exposure. Use sparingly to avoid punishing players excessively.

**Example**: A critical failure on a Stealth check might mean you're not just spotted—you're recognized by someone who has reason to hunt you.

### Retries {#retries}

Can a character retry a failed check? It depends:

- **New Approach**: If circumstances change or the character tries a fundamentally different method, allow a new roll.
- **Same Approach**: If nothing changes, retrying doesn't make sense. The lock is still locked, the guard is still suspicious. Failure stands unless the situation evolves.

**GM Guidance**: Failures should complicate, not block. If a character fails to pick a lock, introduce guards, time pressure, or a need to find another route. Don't let the game stall on one roll.

**Example**: A character fails to persuade a merchant (Persuasion, DC 16). They can't just keep asking. But if they return with leverage (a letter of recommendation, evidence of profit, or a bribe), that's a new approach—new roll.

### Multiple Obstacles {#multiple-obstacles}

When a character faces a series of related challenges (climbing multiple cliff faces, bypassing several security checkpoints), don't call for a roll at every step:

- **Single Roll**: One check represents the entire sequence. Interpret outcome tiers accordingly.
- **Clock**: Use a clock to track progress through multiple obstacles. Each successful check advances the clock.

**Example**: Infiltrating a high-security facility involves bypassing guards, spoofing cameras, and cracking a door lock. Use a 6-segment clock. Each successful check advances the clock by 1 (or 2 on exceptional success). Partials advance but trigger complications. Failures don't advance and add obstacles.

## GM Usage Notes {#gm-usage-notes}

- Call for rolls only when uncertainty, consequence, and agency align.
- Use Partials to maintain momentum while introducing tension. "Yes, but" keeps the story moving.
- Failures complicate and shift situations. Never let a single failed roll become a dead end.
- Group checks streamline collaborative efforts but distribute risk.
- Contests add drama to direct opposition. Use margin to calibrate narrative impact.
- Retries require changed circumstances. Don't let players grind the same roll.

These resolution procedures ensure that dice inform the story without dictating it. The next chapter explores how tags and conditions add texture and consequence to these mechanics.
