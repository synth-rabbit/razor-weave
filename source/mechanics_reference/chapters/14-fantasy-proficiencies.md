# Chapter 14: Fantasy Genre Proficiencies {#fantasy-proficiencies}

Fantasy proficiencies embody the specialized training that separates adventurers from common folk. They represent martial discipline, arcane study, wilderness expertise, and social refinement honed through apprenticeship, guild membership, or hard-won experience. These proficiencies enable characters to survive dungeons, navigate courts, and master the strange and wondrous.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Fantasy settings blend magic and steel, ancient lore and frontier survival. Proficiencies in this genre enable characters to:
- Master weapons, armor, and tactical combat techniques
- Study and manipulate magical forces through ritual, alchemy, or scholarly discipline
- Navigate wilderness terrain, track quarry, and endure harsh conditions
- Engage with noble courts, merchant guilds, and arcane societies

Fantasy proficiencies often unlock access to specialized equipment, restricted knowledge, or social networks. A character with Armorer can maintain enchanted plate; a character with Ritualist can perform rites that others dare not attempt; a character with Court Etiquette can navigate noble intrigue without giving offense.

Cross-reference: See [Chapter 8: Fantasy Skills](#chapter-08) for related skills like Melee Combat, Arcana, Survival, and Persuasion.

## Proficiencies {#proficiencies}

### First Aid — Trained {#prof-first-aid}

**Description**: You have learned to stabilize the wounded under pressure—compress bleeding, splint breaks, and keep someone breathing until proper healing arrives. You are not a miracle worker, but you are the difference between life and death.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Medicine checks to stabilize dying or critically wounded characters
- Reduce DC by 2 when treating injuries in clean or prepared conditions (camp, infirmary)
- Prevent conditions from worsening (Bleeding, Poisoned, Exhausted) with timely intervention
- Reduce recovery clocks for injuries by 1 segment on full success

**Synergies**: Medicine skill, Survival, Herbalist proficiency; pairs well with Clean Space, Infirmary, or Field Camp tags. Counters Bleeding, Poisoned, and Critical Injury conditions.

**Downtime Activities**: Run clinic shifts, train others in basic first aid, stockpile medical supplies, assist professional healers.

**GM Usage**: First Aid is battlefield triage, not miraculous healing. Use it to give characters meaningful choices under pressure (do you stabilize the fallen ally now, or advance while you have advantage?). Partials should save lives but introduce costs—the patient lives but gains Exhausted, or the treatment works but consumes a precious healing kit. First Aid does not erase consequences; it buys time.

### Armorer — Trained {#prof-armorer}

**Description**: You know the language of rivets, straps, and tempered steel. Armor under your care stays fitted, functional, and ready for the next blow.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when repairing, fitting, or maintaining armor
- Advantage on Crafting checks related to armor construction or modification
- Repair damaged armor during short rests or downtime, restoring functionality
- Identify armor quality, enchantments, and weaknesses on inspection
- Fit armor to unusual body types (smaller or larger than human standard)

**Synergies**: Crafting skill, Smithing, Weapon Master proficiency; pairs well with Workshop, Forge, or Armory tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Repair and maintain party armor, take commissions for custom work, train apprentices, source rare materials (mithral, dragonscale), identify and appraise looted armor.

**GM Usage**: Armor degrades. Straps snap, plates crack, joints stiffen. Armorers keep characters protected. Use equipment wear as pacing mechanisms—after brutal fights, armor needs attention. Partials might restore function but leave cosmetic damage (cracked paint, dented plates that restrict movement slightly) or require more time than available. Let Armorers shine when the party finds exotic armor that needs adjustment or when negotiating with smiths and guilds.

---

### Weapon Master — Expert {#prof-weapon-master}

**Description**: You have transcended competence and entered mastery. Your chosen weapon is an extension of intent—no wasted motion, no hesitation, no uncertainty.

**Benefits**:
- Choose one weapon type (longsword, bow, spear, etc.). Gain advantage on all combat checks with that weapon.
- Reduce DC by 3 when performing advanced techniques (disarms, precision strikes, defensive maneuvers) with your mastered weapon
- Recognize weapon craftsmanship, balance, and quality on sight
- Teach weapon techniques to others, granting them temporary advantage during training scenes
- Perform weapon maintenance that extends durability and prevents breakage

**Synergies**: Melee Combat skill, Archery, Tactics; pairs well with Training Yard, Arena, or Battlefield tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Train students, participate in tournaments, maintain weapon collections, craft or commission masterwork weapons, study exotic weapon styles.

**GM Usage**: Weapon Masters should feel exceptional in combat with their chosen weapon. Grant them narrative spotlight moments—disarming the villain's blade, shooting the rope mid-swing, holding a doorway against overwhelming odds. Partials might achieve tactical goals (you disarm the opponent) but create new complications (the weapon falls into the chasm, now unrecoverable). Weapon mastery is also a social signal—other warriors recognize and respect it, opening doors to martial societies and honor duels.

---

### Apothecary — Novice {#prof-apothecary}

**Description**: You brew remedies from roots, resins, and careful patience. Your potions are not magical, but they are effective—balms that numb pain, tinctures that ease fever, poultices that draw out infection.

**Benefits**:
- Brew basic remedies (pain relief, fever reduction, mild antidotes) given time and ingredients
- Advantage on Herbalism or Alchemy checks when creating mundane potions
- Reduce DC by 2 when identifying herbs, fungi, or alchemical components
- Create poultices that reduce recovery time for Poisoned or Diseased conditions

**Synergies**: Alchemy skill, Herbalism, Medicine; pairs well with Workshop, Apothecary Shop, or Forest Edge tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Gather reagents, brew potions for trade or party use, experiment with new recipes, consult on ailments, maintain ingredient stocks.

**GM Usage**: Apothecaries occupy the space between folk remedies and magical potions. Use them to create resource loops—characters gather rare mushrooms during exploration to fuel potion-making during downtime. Partials might produce weaker versions of intended potions (half duration, reduced effect) or require substitutions that add side effects (the antidote works, but causes drowsiness). Let Apothecaries solve problems through preparation and resourcefulness.

---

### Scribe — Trained {#prof-scribe}

**Description**: You preserve knowledge with ink and care. Your hand is steady, your script clear, and your copies faithful. You encode messages, translate tongues, and ensure that words outlast their speakers.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when copying, encoding, or decoding written texts
- Advantage on Lore checks involving ancient or obscure scripts
- Recognize forgeries, alterations, or coded messages in written documents
- Copy texts quickly and accurately, preserving formatting and marginalia
- Encode messages using simple ciphers or symbolic notation

**Synergies**: Lore skill, Languages, Librarian proficiency; pairs well with Archive, Library, or Scriptorium tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Copy manuscripts for clients, translate documents, encode private correspondence, maintain archives, research obscure topics, authenticate historical texts.

**GM Usage**: Scribes are information gatekeepers. Use them to reveal hidden context in ancient texts, detect altered records, or encode secrets that must travel safely. Partials might complete copies with minor errors (a name misspelled, a date transposed) that become clues or complications later. Scribes also interface with libraries, guilds, and institutions—access to rare texts often requires their mediation.

---

### Ritualist — Expert {#prof-ritualist}

**Description**: You perform rites that touch the fabric of reality—blessings that hold, wards that endure, summonings that answer. You understand that ritual is not magic by rote, but magic by relationship.

**Benefits**:
- Perform complex magical rituals (wards, summonings, consecrations) that others cannot attempt
- Reduce DC by 3 when conducting rituals in prepared or consecrated spaces
- Recognize ritual components, diagrams, and symbolic structures on sight
- Adapt rituals to unusual circumstances (limited components, hostile environments, time pressure)
- Teach ritual techniques to others, though mastery takes time

**Synergies**: Arcana skill, Religion, Occult Lore; pairs well with Temple, Sacred Ground, or Ritual Circle tags. Counters or inflicts Cursed, Hexed, or Warded conditions.

**Downtime Activities**: Study ritual traditions, prepare components, consecrate spaces, perform commissioned rituals (weddings, funerals, protective wards), research lost or forbidden rites.

**GM Usage**: Rituals are slow magic with lasting impact. They take time, require preparation, and carry consequences. Use Ritualist checks to frame high-stakes moments (warding the village against undead, summoning a spirit guide, consecrating a desecrated temple). Partials should achieve the ritual's goal but introduce complications (the ward holds but requires daily renewal; the summoning succeeds but the spirit is offended by your haste). Ritualists walk the line between the sacred and the dangerous—let them feel powerful and responsible in equal measure.

---

### Huntsman — Trained {#prof-huntsman}

**Description**: You know how to read trails, prepare game, and survive where others would starve. The wilderness is not hostile to you—it is legible.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Survival checks to track game, forage for food, or navigate wilderness
- Reduce DC by 2 when preparing game (butchering, preserving, cooking)
- Set snares and traps that provide food or early warning
- Recognize animal behavior patterns and predict movements
- Move quietly through natural terrain, reducing chance of alerting prey or predators

**Synergies**: Survival skill, Animal Handling, Tracking; pairs well with Forest, Wilderness, or Hunting Ground tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Hunt to provide food for the party or settlement, set traplines, scout terrain, sell furs and hides, teach wilderness survival.

**GM Usage**: Huntsmen turn wilderness into resource. Use them to mitigate survival challenges (food, navigation, shelter) so players can focus on other story elements. Partials might yield food but at a cost (time spent hunting delays travel; a successful hunt attracts predators or rivals). Let Huntsmen notice environmental storytelling (disturbed game trails signal danger; abundant prey signals safe territory; absent wildlife signals corruption or predation).

---

### Tracker — Trained {#prof-tracker}

**Description**: Footprints, broken twigs, disturbed stones—you read the passage of others as clearly as text. Every creature leaves a signature; you simply know how to see it.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Survival or Investigation checks to follow tracks or identify signs of passage
- Reduce DC by 2 when tracking in familiar terrain or ideal conditions (mud, snow, soft earth)
- Estimate how long ago tracks were made and how many individuals passed
- Identify species, size, and load carried from track patterns
- Notice attempts to conceal or obscure tracks

**Synergies**: Survival skill, Investigation, Huntsman proficiency; pairs well with Wilderness, Urban, or Dungeon tags depending on specialty.

**Downtime Activities**: Work as a guide or scout, track bounties or fugitives, teach tracking skills, study unusual or magical creature signs.

**GM Usage**: Tracking is detective work in motion. Use it to turn pursuits into tense skill challenges (can you catch up before nightfall? before they cross the river?). Partials might follow tracks successfully but lose time (you find the trail, but it loops and backtracks, costing hours) or gain partial information (you know something passed here, but cannot identify what). Let Trackers notice when quarry is aware of pursuit (deliberate misdirection, traps set along the trail).

---

### Climber — Trained {#prof-climber}

**Description**: Vertical surfaces are puzzles, not barriers. You see handholds where others see smooth stone, and you ascend with confidence born from practice and judgment.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Athletics checks to climb natural or constructed surfaces
- Reduce DC by 2 when using climbing gear (rope, pitons, harnesses)
- Rig secure climbing routes for others, granting them advantage
- Assess climbing hazards (loose stone, ice, weather risks) before attempting ascent
- Descend quickly and safely when speed is critical

**Synergies**: Athletics skill, Survival, Mountaineer specialization; pairs well with Elevated, Cliffside, or Mountain tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Scout vertical routes, teach climbing techniques, maintain climbing gear, guide expeditions into mountainous or vertical terrain.

**GM Usage**: Climbers open alternative paths. Use vertical terrain to reward their expertise—the guarded gate is impassable, but the wall is merely difficult. Partials might ascend successfully but slowly (your caution costs time; pursuers gain ground) or create unstable routes (you make it, but the rope frays; the next climber risks a fall). Let climbing be tense and consequential—falls should matter, and success should feel earned.

---

### Court Etiquette — Novice {#prof-court-etiquette}

**Description**: You know the bows, pauses, and phrasings that open doors in noble courts. You navigate rank, precedence, and unspoken rules with practiced ease.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when making formal requests, petitions, or appeals to nobility
- Advantage on Persuasion checks in courtly or formal social settings
- Recognize social hierarchies, heraldry, and protocol at a glance
- Avoid giving offense through ignorance of custom or rank
- Gain access to formal events and spaces that would otherwise be closed

**Synergies**: Persuasion skill, Insight, Diplomat proficiency; pairs well with Royal Court, Formal Banquet, or Noble Estate tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Attend courtly functions, cultivate noble patrons, study heraldry and lineage, mediate formal disputes, navigate bureaucracy.

**GM Usage**: Court Etiquette is social armor—it protects against unintentional offense and opens pathways through hierarchies. Use it to differentiate social challenges: a character without Court Etiquette might offend a duke by addressing him incorrectly; a character with it navigates the same conversation smoothly. Partials might achieve goals without giving offense, but fail to make strong impressions (your petition is accepted, but barely; you are granted audience, but only briefly). Let Court Etiquette be a lens through which characters perceive and manipulate power structures.

---

### Diplomat — Trained {#prof-diplomat}

**Description**: You broker peace, negotiate treaties, and find middle ground between entrenched positions. You understand that most conflicts are solvable if both sides can save face.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when mediating disputes, negotiating treaties, or de-escalating conflicts
- Advantage on Persuasion checks involving formal diplomacy or high-stakes negotiation
- Recognize negotiation tactics (bluffs, delays, concessions) and respond effectively
- Maintain neutrality and credibility even when representing partisan interests
- Facilitate communication between hostile or culturally distinct parties

**Synergies**: Persuasion skill, Insight, Court Etiquette proficiency; pairs well with Neutral Ground, Embassy, or Treaty Hall tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Mediate disputes, negotiate trade agreements, represent factions or nations, cultivate diplomatic contacts, study cultural customs and languages.

**GM Usage**: Diplomats solve problems through words rather than swords. Use them to create alternatives to violence—the war might be prevented if someone can broker terms both sides will accept. Partials might achieve ceasefires or temporary agreements that buy time but do not resolve underlying tensions. Let Diplomats navigate complex social terrain where every word carries weight, and where success means reading context as much as stating terms.

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: First Aid Under Fire {#example-first-aid-fire}

**Context**: During a skirmish with bandits, Rowan the fighter takes a crossbow bolt to the shoulder and collapses, bleeding heavily. Mira, a Trained First Aid specialist, must stabilize him while arrows still fly.

**Action**: Mira drags Rowan behind an overturned cart (cover) and presses cloth against the wound to slow bleeding. She needs to stabilize him before blood loss becomes critical.

**Check**: The GM calls for a Medicine check. Base DC is 16 (critical injury under hostile conditions). Mira has advantage (First Aid proficiency) and can reduce the DC by 2 if conditions are clean or prepared. The cart provides improvised cover but is not clean—GM rules no DC reduction. Mira rolls with advantage.

**Outcome**: Mira rolls a full success. She compresses the wound, slows the bleeding, and stabilizes Rowan. He is unconscious but stable—he will live if they can retreat and get proper care. Mira's quick action prevents the Bleeding condition from advancing to Critical.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial success, Mira stabilizes Rowan, but he gains the Exhausted condition from blood loss. He is alive but weakened—if combat continues, he cannot fight effectively. Additionally, Mira uses her last bandages. The party must find or improvise medical supplies before the next injury.

**Failure Alternative**: On a failure, Mira cannot stop the bleeding in time. Rowan's condition worsens to Critical. Now someone must carry him to safety while Mira attempts a second, more desperate check—or the party must retreat immediately and hope they reach a healer before he dies.

### Example 2: Ritualist Consecrating a Defiled Shrine {#example-ritualist-shrine}

**Context**: The party discovers a shrine to a nature deity that has been defiled by cultists. Dark runes cover the altar, the sacred spring runs black, and an oppressive presence lingers. Elira, an Expert Ritualist, offers to consecrate the shrine and restore its sanctity.

**Action**: Elira studies the defilement, gathers components (blessed water, sacred herbs, chalk for new runes), and begins a multi-hour ritual to cleanse and re-consecrate the shrine.

**Check**: The GM frames this as a ritual with a 6-segment clock (Consecration Progress). Each successful Arcana or Religion check advances the clock. Base DC is 18 (powerful defilement). Elira has advantage and reduces DC by 3 in prepared spaces—she has spent an hour preparing the ritual circle, so the DC becomes 15.

**Outcome**: Elira rolls a full success on the first check, advancing the clock by 2 segments. Over the next several hours, she completes the ritual. The dark runes fade, the spring runs clear, and the oppressive presence lifts. The shrine is restored, and the nature deity's blessing returns—granting travelers who rest there a minor boon (advantage on the next Survival check).

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial success, Elira advances the clock by 1 segment, but the defilement resists. The ritual requires additional components she did not bring (rare incense, a silver offering). The party must venture to a nearby ruin to retrieve them, turning the ritual into a quest. Alternatively, the ritual succeeds but Elira is Exhausted from the spiritual exertion, unable to perform another ritual until she rests.

**Failure Alternative**: On a failure, the defilement reacts violently. The dark runes flare, summoning a minor corrupted spirit that must be fought or banished. The shrine remains defiled, and Elira must start over—but now the cultists know someone is interfering and may send reinforcements.

### Example 3: Tracker Pursuing a Fleeing Assassin {#example-tracker-pursuit}

**Context**: An assassin has murdered a noble and fled into the forest. The party gives chase, but the assassin has a head start and knows the terrain. Kael, a Trained Tracker, leads the pursuit.

**Action**: Kael examines the forest floor—broken branches, disturbed leaves, footprints in soft earth. He estimates the assassin's speed and direction, then leads the party forward.

**Check**: The GM frames this as a pursuit with competing clocks: Pursuit Progress (6 segments, party) vs. Escape Progress (6 segments, assassin). Kael rolls Survival to track. Base DC is 14 (forest terrain, recent tracks). Kael has advantage (Tracker proficiency) and reduces DC by 2 in ideal conditions (recent rain left mud). DC becomes 12.

**Outcome**: Kael rolls a full success, advancing Pursuit Progress by 2 segments. The GM advances Escape Progress by 1 (the assassin is fast but not cautious). Kael's expertise keeps the party on track without losing time. Over several rounds of tracking, the party closes the gap and corners the assassin at a river crossing.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Kael advances Pursuit Progress by 1 segment but also advances Escape Progress by 1 (the trail loops and backtracks, costing time). The pursuit becomes tense—can they catch up before the assassin reaches allies or exits the forest?

**Failure Alternative**: On a failure, Kael loses the trail. The party must stop and search, allowing Escape Progress to advance by 2 segments. The assassin gains ground, and the party must decide: press on with incomplete information (risking the wrong direction), or abandon the chase and pursue other leads.

## GM Guidance: Making Fantasy Proficiencies Matter {#gm-guidance}

Fantasy proficiencies bridge the gap between competence and mastery. Here are strategies for making them feel meaningful:

**Reward specialization**: Fantasy campaigns often feature diverse challenges—combat, exploration, social intrigue, magical mysteries. Let proficiencies grant clear advantages in their domains. A Weapon Master should dominate in their weapon's niche. A Ritualist should access magic unavailable to others. A Diplomat should turn conflicts into conversations.

**Make equipment and access matter**: Proficiencies often interact with gear, guilds, and locations. Armorers need forges and tools. Scribes need libraries and inks. Ritualists need sacred spaces and rare components. Let these requirements create quests and complications—finding a master scribe to teach advanced techniques, securing access to a guild's restricted archives, gathering components for a critical ritual.

**Use proficiencies to differentiate characters**: In a party of warriors, the one with Weapon Master feels distinct from the one with Climber or First Aid. Let proficiencies define roles and spotlight moments. The climber scales the tower while others find another way. The ritualist performs the consecration while others guard the perimeter. The diplomat negotiates while others prepare for the possibility of violence.

**Embrace the limits of proficiencies**: Proficiencies grant expertise, not omnipotence. A Tracker can follow trails, but cannot summon trails where none exist. A Ritualist can perform rituals, but cannot ignore material costs or time requirements. These limits create meaningful choices—do we wait for the ritual, or act now without its protection?

**Let proficiencies grow with the campaign**: As characters advance proficiency tiers, their capabilities should expand noticeably. A Novice Apothecary brews simple remedies. A Trained Apothecary creates potent potions. An Expert Apothecary might develop unique formulas or teach others. This progression rewards long-term investment and gives players goals to pursue.
