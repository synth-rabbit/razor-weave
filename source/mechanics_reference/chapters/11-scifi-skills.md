# Chapter 11: Sci-Fi Genre Skills {#chapter-11}

Sci-fi games explore futures shaped by technology, alien civilizations, and the mysteries of space. These skills turn starships into homes, quantum physics into solutions, and first contact into diplomacy. They are grounded in advanced technology, xenoscience, and the unique challenges of operating beyond planetary boundaries.

This chapter provides ready-to-use skills for sci-fi games—whether space opera, hard science fiction, cyberpunk futures, or post-human settings. Use these skills when your game features faster-than-light travel, alien encounters, cybernetics, or advanced technology.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Sci-fi skills emphasize:

- **Pilot and Navigation**: Pilot Spacecraft, Navigate Hyperspace—skills for operating and navigating starships.
- **Technical Mastery**: System Engineering, Cybernetics, Xenotech—skills for maintaining and manipulating advanced technology.
- **Scientific Expertise**: Xenobiology, Physics, Chemistry—skills for understanding and exploiting scientific principles.
- **Combat Adaptation**: Zero-G Combat, Energy Weapons—skills for fighting in space and with futuristic weapons.
- **Xenosocial Skills**: Diplomacy (Aliens), Negotiate—skills for interacting with non-human species and cultures.

Sci-fi skills often depend on technology level and equipment. A Pilot Spacecraft check requires a functioning ship. A Cybernetics check requires tools and parts. Failed checks can result in cascading system failures, alien misunderstandings, or catastrophic breaches.

For proficiencies that enhance these skills, see Chapter 17 (Sci-Fi Proficiencies). For tags and conditions, see Chapter 18.

## Using Sci-Fi Skills {#using-scifi-skills}

Sci-fi skills reward technical expertise, adaptability, and bold exploration. When using these skills:

- **Require Technology and Equipment**: Piloting requires a ship. Cybernetics requires tools. Physics requires computational models. Make technology integral.
- **Create Cascading Failures**: Failed System Engineering can trigger reactor meltdowns. Failed Navigation can strand the crew. Let failures escalate tension.
- **Use Clocks for Long-Term Operations**: Track ship repairs, hyperspace journeys, alien diplomacy, or reactor stability with clocks (see Chapter 05).
- **Layer Scientific and Tactical Skills**: Combine Xenobiology with Combat to exploit weaknesses. Combine Physics with Piloting for advanced maneuvers.
