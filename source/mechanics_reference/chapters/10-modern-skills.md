# Chapter 10: Modern Genre Skills {#chapter-10}

Modern games focus on contemporary challenges—navigating bureaucracy, hacking networks, operating vehicles, negotiating deals, and surviving urban conflict. These skills turn technology, expertise, and social capital into tools for solving problems. They are grounded in real-world professions, tactical operations, and the complexities of modern life.

This chapter provides ready-to-use skills for modern and contemporary games—whether espionage thrillers, urban crime dramas, disaster response, or everyday professional challenges. Use these skills when your game features modern technology, urban environments, and realistic consequences.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Modern skills emphasize:

- **Professional Expertise**: Law, Medicine, Finance, Administration—skills for navigating institutional systems and specialized knowledge.
- **Technical Capability**: Hacking, Engineering, Driving—skills for operating and manipulating modern technology.
- **Urban Navigation**: Networking, Negotiate, Streetwise—skills for building connections and moving through social landscapes.
- **Tactical Operations**: Firearms, Surveillance, Infiltration—skills for direct action and covert operations.

Modern skills often require specific tools, licenses, or access. A Hacking check might require a laptop and internet connection. A Medicine check might need medical supplies. Failed checks can trigger legal consequences, reputational damage, or systemic obstacles.

For proficiencies that enhance these skills, see Chapter 16 (Modern Proficiencies). For tags and conditions, see Chapter 18.
