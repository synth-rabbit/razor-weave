# Chapter 20: Character Progression Reference {#progression-reference}

Character progression makes growth tangible. As characters overcome challenges, they gain skills, advance proficiencies, and evolve narratively. This chapter provides quick reference for advancement systems, costs, and genre-specific progression pacing.

For skill details, see Chapters 06-11. For proficiency details, see Chapters 12-17. For narrative progression guidance, see the Player Guide and Storyteller Guide.

---

## Advancement Systems {#advancement-systems}

Three primary systems govern character progression. Choose the one that fits your campaign's pacing and style, or blend them.

### XP-Based Advancement {#xp-based}

**How It Works**: Characters earn experience points (XP) for overcoming challenges, achieving goals, and advancing story. Accumulate XP to purchase skills, advance proficiencies, or improve attributes.

**XP Awards**:
- **Minor Success** (solve small problem, overcome minor challenge): 1-2 XP
- **Moderate Success** (complete mission, defeat significant threat): 3-5 XP
- **Major Success** (achieve campaign milestone, overcome major antagonist): 6-10 XP

**Costs**:
- **New Skill**: 5 XP (learn new skill at basic competence)
- **Advance Proficiency** (Novice → Trained): 10 XP
- **Advance Proficiency** (Trained → Expert): 20 XP
- **Advance Proficiency** (Expert → Master): 30 XP
- **Attribute Improvement** (if applicable): 15 XP per +1

**GM Guidance**: XP-based systems reward consistent play and granular advancement. Award XP at session end or after major scenes. Let players bank XP or spend immediately. XP creates clear progression path and player agency over growth.

**When to Use**: Long campaigns with regular sessions. Players who enjoy mechanical progression and optimization. Games where growth is steady and incremental.

---

### Milestone-Based Advancement {#milestone-based}

**How It Works**: Characters advance when they achieve narrative milestones—complete story arcs, overcome major challenges, or reach dramatic turning points. GM determines when milestones occur.

**Milestone Types**:
- **Minor Milestone** (complete session objective, resolve subplot): Gain 1 new skill OR advance 1 proficiency by 1 tier
- **Major Milestone** (complete story arc, defeat major antagonist, reach campaign turning point): Gain 2 new skills OR advance 2 proficiencies OR mix (1 skill + 1 proficiency advance)
- **Campaign Milestone** (complete major campaign phase, reach endgame): Significant advancement (3-5 choices from skills, proficiencies, or attributes)

**GM Guidance**: Milestones tie advancement directly to story. No tracking XP—growth happens at narratively appropriate moments. Communicate upcoming milestones so players can anticipate advancement. Milestones work well for episodic play or campaigns with clear arcs.

**When to Use**: Story-driven campaigns with clear arcs. Groups that prefer narrative progression over mechanical tracking. Irregular session schedules where XP might feel inconsistent.

---

### Session-Based Advancement {#session-based}

**How It Works**: Characters advance at fixed intervals—every session, every 2-3 sessions, or at GM discretion. Simple, predictable, low-bookkeeping.

**Standard Cadence**:
- **Every Session**: Gain 1 skill OR advance 1 proficiency tier
- **Every 2-3 Sessions**: Gain 1 skill AND advance 1 proficiency tier
- **Every 5 Sessions**: Major advancement (2 skills OR 2 proficiency advances OR mix + possible attribute improvement)

**GM Guidance**: Session-based advancement is easiest to track and most predictable. Players know when to expect growth. Works well for groups with consistent schedules. Adjust cadence to match campaign length (faster for short campaigns, slower for long ones).

**When to Use**: Casual groups, new players, or short campaigns. When you want minimal bookkeeping and maximum predictability.

---

## What Advances {#what-advances}

### Skills {#advance-skills}

**Gaining New Skills**: Characters learn new skills through training, experience, or narrative justification. New skills represent capabilities they didn't have before.

**How to Justify**:
- **Downtime Training**: Spend time with mentor, guild, or teacher. Requires time (days to weeks) and possibly cost (tuition, materials).
- **Narrative Growth**: Learn through experience during play (thief learns Lockpicking after watching expert, scholar learns Arcana from ancient tome).
- **Milestone Reward**: Gain skill as reward for achieving milestone that fits narratively (completing heist earns Thievery, surviving wilderness earns Survival).

**Limits**: GMs may cap total skills per character (typically 5-8 skills) to maintain focus and specialization. Skills should reflect character concept and story.

**Example**: After apprenticing with the village healer for two weeks (downtime), the fighter gains Medicine skill. Now they can stabilize allies and treat injuries.

---

### Proficiencies {#advance-proficiencies}

**Tier Progression**: Proficiencies advance through tiers (Novice → Trained → Expert → Master). Each tier grants stronger benefits and broader applications.

**How to Advance**:
- **Downtime Training**: Spend time with mentor or guild. Requires time, cost, and narrative justification. Higher tiers require expert mentors (cannot train to Expert without Expert or Master mentor).
- **Milestone Reward**: Advance proficiency tier as reward for achievements (surviving brutal campaign earns First Aid advancement, completing diplomatic mission advances Diplomat).
- **XP Purchase**: Spend accumulated XP to advance tier (costs scale: 10 XP Novice→Trained, 20 XP Trained→Expert, 30 XP Expert→Master).

**Limits**: Characters typically have 2-4 proficiencies. Quality over quantity—focused expertise is more interesting than broad shallow coverage.

**Example**: The Trained Ritualist completes a major consecration ritual (milestone). GM awards advancement to Expert Ritualist, granting ability to perform more complex rituals and reduced DCs.

---

### Attributes {#advance-attributes}

**If Using Attributes**: Some tables use attributes (Strength, Intellect, Charisma, etc.) to modify checks. If so, attributes advance slowly and represent fundamental capability growth.

**How to Advance**:
- **XP Purchase**: Expensive (15-20 XP per +1). Represents significant investment.
- **Major Milestone**: Award +1 to attribute at campaign milestones (completing major arc, reaching new campaign phase).
- **Narrative Transformation**: Character undergoes significant change (magical enhancement, divine blessing, cybernetic upgrade). Justify mechanically with attribute increase.

**Limits**: Attributes should advance rarely (2-3 times per campaign). They represent baseline capability, not learned skill. Keep increases bounded (typically +0 to +5 range).

**GM Guidance**: Attributes are optional. Many tables run entirely on skills and proficiencies. If using attributes, keep advancement slow and meaningful.

---

## Milestone Rewards {#milestone-rewards}

Milestones tie mechanical advancement to narrative beats. Here are example milestone types and appropriate rewards.

### Story Arc Completion {#milestone-arc}

**Trigger**: Complete major story arc (rescue the prince, stop the ritual, solve the murder).

**Reward**:
- Gain 1 new skill related to arc (Investigation after solving mystery, Combat after warfare arc)
- Advance 1 proficiency tier related to arc
- Gain narrative reward (reputation, title, resource)

**Example**: After defeating the necromancer and ending the undead plague, the party earns milestone. Cleric advances Ritualist proficiency (Trained → Expert). Fighter gains Intimidation skill (reputation as undead-slayer). Both gain "Hero of the Realm" reputation tag.

---

### Character Transformation {#milestone-transformation}

**Trigger**: Character undergoes significant personal change (overcomes fear, embraces destiny, loses innocence).

**Reward**:
- Gain skill reflecting transformation (gain Composure after overcoming trauma, gain Leadership after accepting responsibility)
- Advance proficiency that fits new identity
- Remove or gain condition/tag reflecting change

**Example**: The coward finds courage during desperate battle. Milestone triggers transformation. Character gains Tactics skill (now leads rather than follows) and loses Shaken condition permanently (fear overcome). Player and GM narrate transformation moment.

---

### Training and Study {#milestone-training}

**Trigger**: Character completes significant downtime training (weeks with master, months at academy, intensive study).

**Reward**:
- Gain new skill or advance proficiency tier
- Gain access to restricted knowledge, guild membership, or specialized equipment
- Reduce future training costs in related areas (master's endorsement)

**Example**: After three months at the Arcane Academy (downtime), the wizard advances Arcana skill and gains Scribe proficiency (Novice). They also gain access to academy library (resource for future research).

---

### Survival and Endurance {#milestone-survival}

**Trigger**: Character survives brutal ordeal (deadly combat, harsh wilderness, psychological horror).

**Reward**:
- Gain skill reflecting survival lessons (Survival after wilderness ordeal, Composure after horror)
- Advance proficiency related to survival (First Aid after treating own wounds, Urban Survival after escaping city pursuit)
- Gain condition representing lasting impact (Scarred tag, Hardened condition)

**Example**: After barely escaping the collapsing mine (horror/survival scene), the character gains Urban Survival skill and Exhausted condition (physical toll). They also gain "Mine Survivor" tag (narrative reputation).

---

## Downtime Training {#downtime-training}

Downtime training allows characters to advance between adventures. It requires time, resources, and narrative justification.

### Training Costs and Requirements {#training-costs}

| Advancement | Time Required | Cost | Mentor Required |
|-------------|---------------|------|-----------------|
| **New Skill** | 1-2 weeks | 50-100 gp (or equivalent) | Optional (reduces time to 1 week) |
| **Novice → Trained** | 2-4 weeks | 100-200 gp | Trained or higher mentor |
| **Trained → Expert** | 4-8 weeks | 300-500 gp | Expert or Master mentor |
| **Expert → Master** | 12-24 weeks | 1,000+ gp | Master mentor (rare) |

**GM Guidance**: Adjust costs and time to fit campaign pacing and economy. High-magic settings might have cheaper training (magic academies abundant). Low-magic settings might require rare mentors and extended time. Use training as adventure hooks—finding a Master mentor might be quest itself.

---

### Finding Mentors {#finding-mentors}

**Mentors are NPCs**: Guilds, academies, and settlements have experts willing to teach. Finding appropriate mentor might require investigation, social checks, or quests.

**Mentor Availability by Tier**:
- **Novice/Trained Mentors**: Common in towns and cities. Guild halls, academies, professional organizations.
- **Expert Mentors**: Rare. Found in major cities, specialized guilds, or remote locations. May require introduction or reputation.
- **Master Mentors**: Very rare. Legendary figures, reclusive masters, or faction leaders. Require quests, favors, or extraordinary circumstances to access.

**Example**: The rogue wants to advance Thievery (Trained → Expert). They need Expert mentor. Investigation reveals master thief in capital city. Gaining access requires completing job for Thieves' Guild (adventure hook). Upon completion, mentor agrees to train (4 weeks, 400 gp).

---

### Self-Study {#self-study}

**Without Mentor**: Characters can self-study but it takes longer and may have limits.

**Self-Study Modifiers**:
- **Time**: Double normal training time
- **Resources Required**: Access to books, tools, or practice materials
- **Limits**: Cannot advance beyond Trained without mentor (Expert and Master require direct instruction)

**Example**: The wizard wants to learn new skill (History) but has no mentor. They spend 4 weeks in library (double normal 2 weeks) and 50 gp on books. Successfully gains History skill through self-study.

---

## Narrative Growth {#narrative-growth}

Mechanical advancement should integrate with character arcs. Growth is not just numbers—it's story.

### Integrating Advancement with Story {#integrate-advancement}

**Ask narrative questions when advancing**:
- **How did you learn this?** (New skill or proficiency advance)
- **What changed in you?** (Attribute increase or transformation)
- **Who taught you?** (Mentor-based training)
- **What did this cost you?** (Sacrifices or consequences of growth)

**Example**: Fighter advances Melee Combat skill. Player narrates: "After watching my mentor die in the duel, I swore to master his techniques. Every evening, I practice his forms, hearing his voice correcting my stance. His sword is mine now, and I will honor his legacy."

**GM Guidance**: Encourage players to tie advancement to story. Advancement scenes (montages, training sessions, breakthrough moments) are opportunities for character development. Let mechanical growth reflect narrative growth.

---

### Growth Through Failure {#growth-failure}

**Failure teaches**: Characters can advance through failure as well as success. Failed checks, defeated battles, and lost conflicts create growth opportunities.

**Failure-Based Milestones**:
- **Learn from Defeat**: After losing fight, character trains to overcome weakness (gain skill or advance combat proficiency)
- **Adapt to Loss**: After failing mission, character develops new capability to prevent future failure
- **Overcome Trauma**: After suffering condition or setback, character grows stronger (gain resistance, proficiency, or skill)

**Example**: The diplomat fails to prevent war (failed negotiation). Rather than punish player, GM offers milestone: gain Intimidation skill (learned that sometimes force is necessary) or advance Diplomat proficiency (learned from mistakes, won't fail again).

**GM Guidance**: Failure forward includes advancement. Let meaningful failures drive growth. Not every failure earns advancement, but significant defeats and lessons learned should.

---

## Examples by Genre {#examples-by-genre}

Progression feels different in each genre. Here's how advancement plays out across settings.

### Cozy Progression {#progression-cozy}

- **Session 4**: Survive encounter with monster (milestone). Gain Composure skill (learned to manage fear) and Shaken condition (lasting trauma).
- **Downtime**: Brief rest. Shaken clears, but character is changed.
- **Sessions 5-8**: Continued investigation. Second milestone: advance Composure, gain "Hardened" tag (fear is familiar now).
- **Final Session**: Defeat horror (major milestone). Advance Investigation skill, gain Occult Lore proficiency, but suffer lasting condition (Scarred, Haunted).

**Feel**: Progression is survival. Characters become tougher, warier, and scarred. Growth is bittersweet—capabilities increase but innocence is lost.

- **Session 7**: Betrayed by client (failure milestone). Gain Intimidation skill (won't be double-crossed again) and "Burned by Corps" reputation tag.

**Feel**: Progression is professional. Characters become specialists, networked operators, and survivors in ruthless world.

---

### Sci-Fi Progression {#progression-scifi}

**Pacing**: Moderate to fast. Tied to missions, discoveries, and technological advancement.

**Typical Advancement**:
- **XP or Milestone-Based**: XP for exploration/episodic games, milestones for campaign arcs

**Feel**: Progression is discovery and adaptation. Characters become frontier experts, explorers, and survivors of the unknown.

---

## GM Guidance: Pacing Advancement {#gm-guidance-pacing}

**Match pacing to campaign length**:
- **Short campaigns (6-12 sessions)**: Fast advancement. Milestones every 2-3 sessions or XP awards generous. Let characters feel powerful.
- **Medium campaigns (12-30 sessions)**: Moderate advancement. Balance mechanical growth with story development.
- **Long campaigns (30+ sessions)**: Slow advancement. Let characters savor each new capability. Growth is earned and meaningful.

**Communicate advancement expectations**: Tell players how fast advancement will be. Set expectations about milestone frequency or XP awards. Avoid surprises.

**Tie advancement to story**: Mechanical growth should reflect narrative growth. Advancement scenes (training montages, breakthrough moments, mentorship) are roleplay opportunities.

**Reward different playstyles**: Some players optimize mechanics; others focus on story. Offer both mechanical rewards (skills, proficiencies) and narrative rewards (reputation, relationships, resources).

**Let failure teach**: Meaningful failures can trigger advancement. Learn from defeats, adapt to setbacks, overcome trauma. Growth through adversity is powerful storytelling.
