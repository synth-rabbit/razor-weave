# Clocks and Progress Tracking {#clocks-progress}

Clocks are segmented progress trackers that turn abstract goals and threats into concrete, visible progress. They answer the question "how close are we?" for long-term efforts, mounting dangers, and time-sensitive challenges.

## What Clocks Are {#what-clocks-are}

A clock is a circle divided into segments—typically 4, 6, or 8. Each segment represents a unit of progress toward completion. When all segments fill, the clock completes, and the associated event resolves.

**4-Segment Clocks**: Quick progress for minor goals or imminent threats. Use for short-term projects, fast-moving dangers, or simple objectives.

**6-Segment Clocks**: Standard progress for moderate goals or medium-term threats. Use for investigations, crafting projects, or threats that unfold over multiple scenes.

**8-Segment Clocks**: Extended progress for major goals or long-term threats. Use for grand rituals, epic journeys, faction projects, or slow-building dangers.

**GM Guidance**: Choose clock size based on narrative weight and desired pacing. A 4-segment clock completes quickly, creating urgency. An 8-segment clock unfolds over multiple sessions, providing long-term structure. You can adjust clock sizes mid-game if pacing feels off—narrative needs trump initial choices.

## When to Use Clocks {#when-to-use-clocks}

Clocks work best for situations where progress is incremental and time matters:

**Long-Term Goals**: Character projects that unfold over multiple scenes. Building a reputation, researching ancient lore, or repairing a damaged ship. Each successful action advances the clock.

**Mounting Threats**: Dangers that escalate over time. Pursuing enemies closing in, plagues spreading, or structural collapses. Clocks tick forward based on time passing or failed checks.

**Ticking Dangers**: Time-sensitive situations with a deadline. Rituals completing, bombs counting down, or rescue windows closing. Clocks advance on a schedule—every scene, every hour, or at narrative beats.

**Faction Projects**: Off-screen activities by NPCs or organizations. Rival factions building power, political movements gaining momentum, or enemies preparing attacks. Clocks represent background developments that shape the world.

**Complex Tasks**: Multi-step endeavors too complex for a single check. Organizing festivals, infiltrating organizations, or navigating bureaucracies. Each successful check advances the clock.

**GM Guidance**: Clocks make progress visible and create tension. Players see segments filling and know they're advancing—or that danger is mounting. Use clocks when you want players to feel progress accumulating or threats building, not just abstract "someday."

## Advancing Clocks {#advancing-clocks}

Clocks advance based on triggers appropriate to their nature:

**Success-Based Advancement**: Successful checks advance the clock. Use this for player-driven goals. A successful Research check advances the Investigation clock. A successful Diplomacy check advances the Alliance clock.

**Time-Based Advancement**: Clocks tick forward as time passes. Use this for mounting threats and deadlines. The Ritual Completion clock advances by 1 segment per hour. The Structural Collapse clock advances every scene.

**Event-Based Advancement**: Clocks advance when specific narrative events occur. Use this for faction projects or background developments. The Rival's Plot clock advances when the rivals learn key information or remove obstacles.

**Partial Outcomes**: On Partial successes, you might advance the clock by 1 segment but also trigger a complication. This reflects progress with cost.

**Exceptional Results**: On particularly good rolls or clever approaches, advance the clock by 2 segments instead of 1. Reward ingenuity and good fortune.

**GM Guidance**: Be transparent about what advances clocks. Players should know what actions contribute to progress and what risks advancing threat clocks. Hidden clocks create mystery but visible ones create investment.

### Clock Advancement Examples

**4-Segment Clock - Cozy**: Organizing a last-minute bake sale to fund repairs. Each successful Baking or Event Planning check advances the clock. Completing the clock means the sale succeeds and funds are raised.

**6-Segment Clock - Fantasy**: Tracking through a wilderness to find a hidden grove. Each successful Survival or Wayfinding check advances the clock. Completing the clock means you find the grove.

**8-Segment Clock - Horror**: A dark ritual nearing completion. The clock advances every midnight. Players must disrupt the ritual before all segments fill, or the entity manifests.

## Multiple Clocks {#multiple-clocks}

Running multiple clocks simultaneously creates dynamic tension by tracking competing pressures:

**Opposing Clocks**: Two clocks race toward completion. Players advance their Escape clock while the GM advances the Pursuit clock. First to complete determines the outcome.

**Layered Clocks**: Multiple clocks track different aspects of a situation. A heist might track Infiltration (player clock), Security Response (threat clock), and Time Until Shift Change (deadline clock). Players must balance advancing their goal while managing threats.

**Cascading Clocks**: Completing one clock triggers or accelerates another. Completing the Gather Allies clock might unlock the Assault the Stronghold clock. Completing the Ritual Preparation clock might start the Perform Ritual clock.

**GM Guidance**: Don't overwhelm the table with too many clocks. Two to three active clocks create dynamic tension. More than that can feel chaotic. Retire completed or irrelevant clocks to keep focus sharp.

### Multiple Clock Example (Modern)

**Situation**: Detectives investigate a serial killer while the killer prepares their next attack.

**Investigation Clock** (6 segments, player-driven): Advances with successful Investigation, Forensics, or Interrogation checks. Completing reveals the killer's identity and location.

**Next Victim Clock** (4 segments, time-based): Advances every session or at narrative beats. Completing means the killer strikes again, adding urgency.

**Pressure**: Players feel the tension between thorough investigation (which takes time) and racing the clock (which risks missing clues). Partials advance the Investigation clock but might also advance the Next Victim clock, as time passes during failed leads.

## Examples by Genre {#examples-by-genre}

### Cozy: Harvest Festival Preparation {#cozy-example}

**Clock**: 6-segment, player-driven
**Goal**: Organize the annual harvest festival successfully

**Advancement**: Each successful Event Planning, Baking, or Negotiation check advances the clock by 1. Partials advance the clock but create minor complications (volunteer shortages, ingredient costs, rival towns' jealousy).

**Completion**: The festival succeeds. The town's reputation grows, and characters earn community goodwill.

**Complication**: A rival town runs a concurrent event. The GM introduces a second clock (Rival Festival, 4 segments, time-based) that advances every scene. If the rival clock completes first, some vendors and attendees go to the rival festival instead, reducing the player festival's success.

### Fantasy: Ritual Completion {#fantasy-example}

**Clock**: 8-segment, time-based
**Goal**: Disrupt an enemy ritual before it summons a demon

**Advancement**: The ritual clock advances by 1 segment every midnight. Players must infiltrate the enemy's sanctum, disrupt preparations, or eliminate the ritualists before all 8 segments fill.

**Completion**: If the clock completes, the demon manifests and becomes a major threat. If players disrupt the ritual (by reducing the ritualists' numbers, destroying components, or desecrating the site), the clock stops advancing or even loses segments.

**Pressure**: Players balance preparation (which takes time) against urgency (midnight approaches). Each day spent gathering allies or researching weaknesses is a day the clock advances.

### Horror: Sanity Degradation {#horror-example}

**Clock**: 6-segment, event-based
**Goal**: Track a character's mental stability as they uncover occult truths

**Advancement**: The clock advances when the character witnesses disturbing events, reads forbidden texts, or experiences trauma. Each segment represents a step toward breaking.

**Completion**: When the clock completes, the character gains a permanent mental condition (Obsessed, Paranoid, or worse) or experiences a psychotic break that requires narrative resolution.

**Management**: Characters can reduce segments through therapy (Psychology skill), rest in safe environments, or confronting fears narratively. The clock creates tension between pursuing dangerous truths and maintaining sanity.

### Modern: Criminal Investigation {#modern-example}

**Clock**: 6-segment, player-driven
**Goal**: Gather enough evidence to arrest a corrupt official

**Advancement**: Successful Investigation, OSINT, or Interrogation checks advance the clock by 1. Exceptional success advances by 2. Partials advance the clock but trigger complications (evidence is circumstantial, witnesses recant, media leaks).

**Completion**: Players have enough evidence for an arrest. The case moves to trial or resolution.

**Opposing Clock**: The official's Cover-Up clock (4 segments, event-based) advances when players make mistakes, leave traces, or tip off the official. If the Cover-Up clock completes first, the official flees, destroys evidence, or leverages political power to quash the investigation.

### Sci-fi: Starship Repairs {#scifi-example}

**Clock**: 8-segment, player-driven
**Goal**: Repair critical ship systems before life support fails

**Advancement**: Successful Systems Engineering or EVA Repair checks advance the clock by 1. Clever jury-rigging or exceptional rolls advance by 2. Partials advance but consume resources (materials, air, time).

**Completion**: The ship is functional. Life support stabilizes, and the crew can navigate to safety.

**Deadline Clock**: Life Support Failure (4 segments, time-based) advances every scene or hour. If it completes before the Repair clock, the crew must evacuate, seek rescue, or face catastrophic failure.

**Decision Point**: Players must choose between thorough repairs (slower, more checks) and quick patches (faster, riskier, potentially creating new problems later).

## GM Usage Notes {#gm-usage-notes}

- Use clocks to make abstract progress concrete and visible. Players should see their efforts accumulating.
- Choose clock size based on narrative weight and desired pacing: 4 for quick, 6 for standard, 8 for extended.
- Advance clocks based on appropriate triggers: success-based for player goals, time-based for threats, event-based for background developments.
- Run multiple clocks to create dynamic tension, but don't overwhelm the table. Two to three active clocks are usually sufficient.
- Be transparent about what advances clocks unless mystery is essential. Visible progress creates investment.
- Adjust clock sizes mid-game if pacing feels off. Narrative needs trump initial choices.
- Completing a clock should trigger meaningful change—goals achieved, threats realized, or situations transformed.

Clocks turn "someday" into "soon" and "eventually" into "now." They create urgency, track progress, and make time mechanically meaningful. Use them to pace long-term arcs, build tension, and give players a sense of momentum or mounting danger.
