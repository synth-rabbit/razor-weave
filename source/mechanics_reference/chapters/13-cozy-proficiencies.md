# Chapter 13: Cozy Genre Proficiencies {#cozy-proficiencies}

Cozy proficiencies celebrate the art of making, tending, and connecting. They reflect mastery of crafts passed down through generations, the satisfaction of work done well, and the quiet heroism of keeping communities functioning. These proficiencies transform everyday tasks into sources of pride, income, and narrative possibility.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Cozy games center on domestic rhythms, artisanal crafts, community service, and harmonious relationships with nature. Proficiencies in this genre enable characters to:
- Create goods that comfort, delight, or sustain others
- Maintain homes, gardens, and communal spaces
- Organize festivals, mediate disputes, and strengthen social bonds
- Work with animals, plants, and the land in respectful partnership

Unlike combat-focused proficiencies, cozy proficiencies measure success in relationships deepened, traditions honored, and small joys multiplied. A successful Baking check might mend a rift between neighbors. A partial success on Festival Organizing might create a memorable event despite logistical chaos. These proficiencies thrive in low-stakes contexts where care and competence matter more than danger and drama.

Cross-reference: See [Chapter 7: Cozy Skills](#chapter-07) for related skills like Cooking, Homemaking, Gardening, and Hospitality.

## Proficiencies {#proficiencies}

### Baker — Trained {#prof-baker}

**Description**: You know thealchemy of flour, water, heat, and time. Your bread rises evenly, your pastries flake perfectly, and your creations carry the warmth that turns a meal into a memory.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when baking to impress, comfort, or celebrate
- Advantage on Cooking checks when preparing baked goods specifically
- Produce festival-grade items that can shift community mood or mend social rifts
- Create signature recipes that become locally famous

**Synergies**: Cooking skill, Homemaking, Hospitality; pairs well with Warm Hearth or Community Gathering tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Run a bakery or stall, supply festivals or markets, teach apprentices, develop new recipes, participate in baking competitions.

**GM Usage**: Baking is social glue in cozy settings. A successful bake can open conversations, earn favors, or change NPC attitudes. Partials might produce delicious goods that strain ingredient supplies or attract too much attention (now everyone wants your cinnamon rolls and you cannot keep up). Use baking as a lens for community dynamics—who gets first access to the baker's oven? What recipes are kept secret? What traditions surround harvest bread or wedding cakes?

### Potter — Novice {#prof-potter}

**Description**: Clay yields to your hands, becoming vessels that hold water, soup, and sentiment. Your work is functional first, beautiful second, but the two are not separate.

**Benefits**:
- Create serviceable pottery for household or trade use
- Advantage on Crafting checks when working with clay
- Reduce DC by 2 when repairing ceramic goods
- Produce basic decorative items (vases, tiles, ornamental pieces)

**Synergies**: Crafting skill, Artisan communities; pairs well with Workshop or Market Day tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Produce pottery for sale or trade, take commissions for custom pieces, teach basic pottery, gather and prepare clay.

**GM Usage**: Pottery is patient work that rewards focus. Use it to create calm, meditative moments or to explore themes of impermanence and care (a cherished bowl that cracks, a rushed repair that fails). Partials might produce functional but flawed pieces—a cup with an uneven lip, a plate that wobbles. These imperfections can become narrative hooks (the mayor insists on only perfect dishware for the banquet; now what?).

---

### Seamstress — Trained {#prof-seamstress}

**Description**: Needle and thread are extensions of your intent. You mend torn hems, tailor ill-fitting garments, and create clothing that flatters, protects, or makes a statement.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when mending or altering garments
- Advantage on Crafting checks for sewing, embroidery, or tailoring
- Create custom clothing that grants social advantage in specific contexts (formal wear for Court Etiquette, work clothes that signal trade affiliation)
- Repair damaged fabric goods quickly during downtime

**Synergies**: Crafting skill, Fashion sense, Hospitality; pairs well with Market Day, Community Gathering, or Workshop tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Run a tailor shop, take commissions, teach sewing classes, create clothing for festivals or ceremonies, mend community wardrobe stock.

**GM Usage**: Clothing carries meaning. A well-tailored outfit can shift social position or effect in formal settings. Seamstress checks can also represent repairing gear, sails, or banners—functional sewing under pressure. Partials might complete the work but leave small tells (visible stitching, slight misalignment) or require more time than available. Use this proficiency to explore themes of presentation, identity, and care (mending a beloved coat, creating a wedding dress, disguising someone's station).

---

### Homekeeper — Novice {#prof-homekeeper}

**Description**: You maintain order and comfort in domestic spaces. Floors stay swept, hearths stay warm, and visitors feel welcome without knowing exactly why.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when organizing, cleaning, or maintaining a household
- Advantage on Homemaking checks to create welcoming environments
- Efficiently manage household supplies, reducing waste and stretching resources
- Notice when domestic spaces are disturbed or unusual

**Synergies**: Homemaking skill, Hospitality; pairs well with Warm Hearth, Clean Space, or Cozy Interior tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Manage a household, prepare spaces for guests or events, coordinate cleaning or maintenance efforts, mentor others in domestic skills.

**GM Usage**: Homekeeping might seem mundane, but it creates the baseline against which disruption registers. A Homekeeper notices when something is out of place—evidence of intrusion, illness, or distress. Use this proficiency to establish setting details (a cluttered study signals distraction; an immaculate kitchen signals control or anxiety). Partials might achieve cleanliness but miss subtleties (you clean the inn, but the hidden note behind the loose board stays hidden).

---

### Chef — Trained {#prof-chef}

**Description**: You do not merely cook—you compose. Ingredients harmonize under your direction, and meals become events that linger in memory long after plates are cleared.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 3 when cooking to impress, comfort, or celebrate
- Advantage on Cooking checks for complex or multi-course meals
- Create dishes that grant temporary morale boosts or shift NPC attitudes
- Identify quality ingredients by sight, smell, and touch
- Improvise meals from limited or unusual ingredients

**Synergies**: Cooking skill, Hospitality, Foraging; pairs well with Feast Prepared, Warm Hearth, or Community Gathering tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Run a restaurant or inn kitchen, cater events, develop signature dishes, teach cooking, source rare ingredients, participate in culinary competitions.

**GM Usage**: Cooking is an intimate act that builds trust and opens conversations. A meal prepared with skill can turn rivals into allies, soothe tensions, or celebrate victories. Partials might produce delicious food that exhausts supplies, takes longer than expected, or inadvertently reveals cultural misunderstandings (you prepared the traditional dish, but used the festival version at a funeral—oops). Use cooking to explore themes of care, tradition, and resourcefulness.

---

### Town Crier — Novice {#prof-town-crier}

**Description**: Your voice carries news, warnings, and celebrations through streets and squares. People listen not just because you are loud, but because you are trusted.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when spreading news or rallying public attention
- Advantage on Persuasion or Performance checks when making public announcements
- Quickly assess public mood by reading crowd reactions
- Gain access to community news networks and gossip chains

**Synergies**: Persuasion skill, Performance, Gossip; pairs well with Market Day, Community Gathering, or Public Square tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Spread official announcements, relay community news, mediate public disputes, gather information from public spaces.

**GM Usage**: Town Criers are information hubs. They know what is being talked about, what is being hidden, and what is being spun. Use this proficiency to connect characters to community events and rumors. Partials might spread the message but garble details, or deliver accurate news that sparks unintended reactions (announcing the mayor's engagement accidentally reveals the secret affair that preceded it). Town Criers can also be targeted—silencing the crier silences the message.

---

### Festival Organizer — Trained {#prof-festival-organizer}

**Description**: You turn chaos into celebration. You know how to rally volunteers, coordinate schedules, and ensure that the maypole does not collapse mid-dance.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when organizing community events or rallying volunteers
- Advantage on Event Planning checks for festivals, markets, or gatherings
- Reduce chaos or complication clocks by 1 segment on full success when organizing events
- Coordinate multiple parallel tasks efficiently, delegating with clarity
- Anticipate logistical problems before they escalate

**Synergies**: Event Planning skill, Persuasion, Leadership; pairs well with Community Gathering, Market Day, or Festival Preparation tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Organize seasonal festivals, coordinate market days, plan community celebrations, build event infrastructure, recruit and train volunteers.

**GM Usage**: Festival Organizer checks often involve juggling multiple clocks—supply shortages, weather complications, interpersonal conflicts. Success means the event runs smoothly and strengthens community bonds. Partials might achieve a memorable event that leaves some frayed nerves or depleted resources. Use festivals as pressure-cooker scenarios that reveal character dynamics (who helps? who undermines? who claims credit?). Festivals also invite external complications (traveling merchants with dubious wares, unexpected guests, sudden storms).

### Herbalist — Trained {#prof-herbalist}

**Description**: You know plants not as decorations but as partners—which soothe, which invigorate, which must never be brewed together. Your remedies carry generations of careful observation.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when identifying, gathering, or preparing medicinal herbs
- Advantage on Gardening or Foraging checks related to herbs and medicinal plants
- Brew remedies that ease minor ailments (headaches, indigestion, insomnia, minor wounds)
- Create poultices and salves that reduce recovery time for injuries or illnesses
- Recognize poisonous or dangerous plants on sight

**Synergies**: Gardening skill, Foraging, Medicine; pairs well with Garden, Forest Edge, or Apothecary tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Gather and dry herbs, prepare remedies for trade or community use, tend medicinal gardens, teach herblore, consult on health concerns.

**GM Usage**: Herbalists occupy the space between folk medicine and professional healing. Use this proficiency to address minor ailments that do not require dramatic intervention but still matter to characters (soothing a sick child, easing an elder's aching joints). Partials might produce effective remedies with unpleasant side effects (the tea works, but tastes vile; the salve heals, but stains skin green for days). Herbalists also know local ecology intimately—they notice when plants sicken, when seasons shift unusually, when something in the environment is wrong.

### Beekeeper — Novice {#prof-beekeeper}

**Description**: You tend the hives with respect and patience. In return, the bees grant you honey, wax, and a small miracle of cooperative labor.

**Benefits**:
- Safely harvest honey and beeswax without harming the hive
- Advantage on Animal Handling checks involving bees or hive management
- Recognize hive health and diagnose common bee ailments
- Produce honey and wax for trade, cooking, or crafting
- Understand pollination patterns and can advise on garden placement

**Synergies**: Animal Handling skill, Gardening, Nature Lore; pairs well with Garden, Meadow, or Orchard tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Tend hives, harvest honey and wax, expand or relocate hives, trade bee products, consult on pollination and crop health.

**GM Usage**: Beekeeping is steady, seasonal work that connects characters to natural rhythms. Use it to mark time (honey harvest signals late summer) and to introduce environmental complications (hives struggling signals ecological stress). Partials might yield good honey but agitate the hive (now you are covered in stings), or produce wax but in quantities too small for the planned candle order. Bees also serve as narrative sensors—when the bees abandon their hives, something is wrong. When they thrive, the land is healthy.

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: Baker Mending a Rift {#example-baker-rift}

**Context**: Two neighbors, Marna and Tobin, have not spoken in weeks after a property dispute. The annual Harvest Festival is days away, and their feud is souring the community mood. Elara, a Trained Baker, decides to intervene.

**Action**: Elara bakes a honey-walnut loaf—a traditional reconciliation gift in her village. She delivers it to Marna's door with a carefully neutral message: "For sharing at the festival, if you are willing."

**Check**: Elara's player rolls Cooking (to bake the loaf) with advantage (Baker proficiency) and a DC reduced by 2 (Baker benefit for baking to mend social rifts). The GM sets the base DC at 14 (Marna is stubborn). With the reduction, DC becomes 12.

**Outcome**: Elara rolls a full success. The bread is perfect—flaky crust, soft interior, fragrant with honey. Marna accepts it, and the gesture opens a conversation. By the festival, Marna and Tobin are civil, if not warm. The community tension eases. Elara's bakery gains a reputation for peacemaking as well as pastries.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial success, the bread is good, but the gesture is interpreted as taking sides. Marna accepts it gladly, but Tobin feels slighted. The rift shifts rather than mends. Elara now has to bake a second loaf for Tobin to restore balance—more work, more time, more tension before resolution.

### Example 2: Festival Organizer Under Pressure {#example-festival-pressure}

**Context**: The Midsummer Festival is tomorrow, and a supply wagon has broken down miles outside town. Half the decorations, most of the candles, and the centerpiece maypole ribbons are stuck in the mud. Kael, a Trained Festival Organizer, must improvise.

**Action**: Kael gathers available volunteers, reallocates tasks, and sends runners to nearby farms to borrow materials. He coordinates three parallel efforts: repairing the wagon, sourcing substitute decorations, and reassuring increasingly anxious vendors.

**Check**: The GM frames this as an Event Planning check with three clocks: Wagon Repair (4 segments), Substitute Decorations (4 segments), and Vendor Morale (6 segments). Kael has advantage (Festival Organizer proficiency) and can reduce chaos clocks by 1 segment on a full success.

**Outcome**: Kael rolls and achieves a full success on the coordination check. He advances Wagon Repair by 2 segments (volunteers work efficiently under his direction), Substitute Decorations by 2 segments (local farmers donate ribbon and garlands), and Vendor Morale by 3 segments (Kael's calm confidence spreads). The chaos clock, which was at 3 segments, reduces by 1. The festival happens on time, with a patchwork charm that becomes its own story.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Kael fixes two of the three problems but not the third. The wagon is repaired and decorations sourced, but vendor morale cracks—several pull out, leaving gaps in the market. The festival happens, but it feels diminished. Kael gains a reputation for competence under pressure, but also for cutting corners. Next time, some vendors might hesitate to commit.

### Example 3: Herbalist Diagnosing Blight {#example-herbalist-blight}

**Context**: The village's medicinal herb garden is wilting. Leaves yellow, stems droop, and the usually fragrant plants smell faintly of rot. Sienna, a Trained Herbalist, investigates.

**Action**: Sienna examines the soil, roots, and nearby plants. She checks for pests, water quality, and signs of disease.

**Check**: The GM calls for a Gardening check with advantage (Herbalist proficiency grants advantage on checks involving medicinal plants). The DC is 16 (the blight is subtle and unfamiliar).

**Outcome**: Sienna rolls a full success. She identifies the problem: runoff from a new tannery upstream is contaminating the water supply with trace chemicals. The blight is not disease, but poisoning. Armed with this knowledge, the village can address the source—either relocating the garden's water intake or negotiating with the tannery to change their disposal practices.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Sienna identifies that something is wrong with the water, but not the exact cause. She recommends stopping irrigation temporarily and switching to rainwater collection. This buys time and prevents further damage, but does not solve the root issue. The blight slows but does not stop. Sienna must investigate further, perhaps seeking help from a Trained Chemist or Water Engineer in a nearby town—turning the problem into a quest rather than a quick fix.

## GM Guidance: Making Cozy Proficiencies Matter {#gm-guidance}

Cozy proficiencies thrive in campaigns where relationships, traditions, and community matter. Here are strategies for making them feel meaningful:

**Tie proficiencies to community needs**: A Baker is more valuable when food is culturally significant, a Festival Organizer matters more when festivals are community anchors, and a Herbalist shines when access to professional medicine is limited or expensive.

**Let proficiencies open narrative doors**: Characters with cozy proficiencies should gain access to social networks, resources, and information unavailable to others. The Town Crier hears rumors first. The Chef is invited to private dinners where deals are made. The Seamstress knows who is commissioning wedding clothes and who is mending traveling cloaks—both signal change.

**Use downtime as story fuel**: Downtime is not dead time. When a character spends downtime running a bakery, ask what happens. Do they notice someone hoarding flour? Does a traveling merchant offer rare spices? Does a regular customer stop showing up? Downtime proficiency use should generate hooks, complications, and opportunities.

**Embrace partials creatively**: Partial successes in cozy contexts should not feel like failures. They should feel like life—messy, complicated, bittersweet. The bread is delicious, but now you are out of flour for the week. The festival is a success, but you are exhausted and owe three favors. The herb remedy works, but the patient is grumpy about the taste and complains loudly.

**Celebrate small victories**: Cozy proficiencies measure success in warmth, comfort, and connection. A perfect loaf of bread, a smoothly run festival, a garden brought back to health—these are victories. Treat them as such. Let players feel the satisfaction of work done well, care given freely, and communities strengthened.
