# Chapter 06: Skills Introduction {#chapter-06}

Skills are fiction-first capabilities that define what your character can do when the outcome is uncertain. They represent practiced competencies—from climbing a castle wall to negotiating a trade deal, from baking a wedding cake to navigating hyperspace. Skills turn uncertainty into motion, risk into opportunity.

This chapter explains how skills work, how to choose them during character creation, and how to interpret skill entries in the genre-specific chapters that follow.

## What Skills Represent {#what-skills-represent}

Skills are not abstract numbers. They are grounded capabilities shaped by your character's experience, training, and genre context. A character with Stealth knows how to move quietly, read patrol patterns, and exploit shadows. A character with Persuasion understands how to frame requests, read social dynamics, and build rapport.

When you roll a skill check, you are asking: "Can my character accomplish this goal given the fiction and the circumstances?" The DC reflects how difficult the task is. The outcome—success, partial success, or failure—determines what happens next in the story.

Skills operate on a **fiction-first** principle: if the fiction doesn't support the action, no roll happens. You cannot use Persuasion to convince a dragon to become a vegetarian if the dragon has no reason to listen. You cannot use Stealth to sneak past a magical alarm that detects life force. The GM adjudicates what is possible based on the established fiction, then calls for a roll if the outcome is uncertain and interesting.

## Skill Categories {#skill-categories}

Skills are organized into six broad categories. These categories help you navigate skill choices and understand how different skills interact:

- **Exploration**: Skills for navigating, investigating, and interacting with the environment—Stealth, Perception, Athletics, Investigation, Wayfinding.
- **Social**: Skills for influencing, understanding, and interacting with people—Persuasion, Insight, Negotiation, Intimidation, Comfort.
- **Technical**: Skills requiring specialized knowledge or tools—Medicine, Thievery, Hacking, Engineering, Forensics.
- **Combat**: Skills for direct conflict and tactical maneuvers—Melee Combat, Archery, Firearms, Tactics, Zero-G Combat.
- **Arcane/Divine**: Skills for magical, spiritual, or supernatural knowledge—Arcana, Religion, Ritual, Occult Lore.
- **Wilderness**: Skills for surviving and thriving in natural environments—Survival, Animal Handling, Gardening, Foraging.

These categories are descriptive, not restrictive. Some skills bridge multiple categories. The categories exist to help you find the right tool for the situation.

## How to Read Skill Entries {#how-to-read-skill-entries}

Each skill entry in Chapters 07-11 follows a consistent format:

**Skill Name — Category**: The skill's name and primary category.

**Description**: A fiction-first explanation of what the skill represents and how it feels in play.

**Default Actions**: Common tasks associated with this skill, along with DC ranges (typically 12-22). These are examples, not exhaustive lists. The GM adjusts DCs based on position, effect, and circumstances.

**Synergies**: Proficiencies, tags, or conditions that enhance this skill. For example, Stealth synergizes with the Dim tag or Cloaked condition.

**Counters**: Tags or conditions that make this skill harder or less effective. For example, Stealth is countered by the Alert tag or Tracking Dogs condition.

**GM Usage**: Practical guidance for adjudicating this skill at the table—how to make it interesting, when to call for rolls, and how to interpret outcomes.

**Example**: A brief worked example showing the skill in action within the genre context.

When reading skill entries, focus on the fiction first, then the mechanics. Ask: "What does this skill let my character do?" Then consider: "What circumstances make this easier or harder?"

## Choosing Skills for Character Creation {#choosing-skills}

During character creation, you will select skills that define your character's capabilities. The number of skills you start with depends on your game's character creation system—consult your GM or the Player Guide for specifics.

When choosing skills, consider:

1. **Genre Fit**: Choose skills appropriate for your game's genre. A cozy village game rarely needs Firearms. A sci-fi campaign rarely needs Baking (unless you are the ship's cook).
2. **Character Concept**: Choose skills that reflect who your character is. A former guard might have Perception and Tactics. A traveling bard might have Performance and Streetwise.
3. **Party Synergy**: Consider what your party needs. If no one has Medicine, someone should cover it. If everyone has Persuasion, consider diversifying.
4. **Growth Potential**: Choose skills you want to improve through proficiencies. If you take Cooking, you might later gain the Baker proficiency to specialize.

Skills are not permanent straitjackets. Over time, you can acquire new skills through downtime training or narrative milestones. See Chapter 20 for progression mechanics.

## Creating Custom Skills {#creating-custom-skills}

If the premade skills in Chapters 07-11 do not fit your character concept, you can create a custom skill with your GM's approval. Use this template:

**Skill Name — Category**

**Description**: A 1-2 sentence fiction-first description of what this skill represents.

**Default Actions**: 3-5 common tasks with DC ranges (12-22). Include at least one opposed check or group action.

**Synergies**: Proficiencies, tags, or conditions that enhance this skill.

**Counters**: Tags or conditions that make this skill harder.

**Variants**: Genre-specific or context-specific variations (e.g., "Urban vs Wilderness").

**GM Usage**: How to adjudicate this skill at the table. What makes it interesting? When should you call for rolls?

**Example**: A brief worked example showing the skill in action.

### Balance Guidelines {#balance-guidelines}

When creating custom skills:

- **Scope**: Skills should be broad enough to be useful but focused enough to have identity. "Investigation" is good. "Noticing Things" is too broad. "Analyzing Fingerprints" is too narrow.
- **DC Ranges**: Use the standard DC ladder (see Chapter 02). Simple tasks start at DC 12. Challenging tasks range from 14-18. Difficult or complex tasks range from 18-22.
- **Synergies and Counters**: Identify at least two synergies and two counters. These create tactical depth and help the GM adjudicate edge cases.
- **Genre Fit**: Ensure the skill fits your game's genre and tone. A skill called "Social Media Savvy" fits Modern but not Fantasy.

Bring your custom skill to your GM for review. Adjust as needed. The goal is to create a skill that feels distinct, useful, and fun to roll.

## Using This Section {#using-this-section}

Chapters 07-11 provide genre-specific skill packages:

- **Chapter 07: Cozy Genre Skills** — Domestic, crafting, community, and nature skills for slice-of-life games.
- **Chapter 08: Fantasy Genre Skills** — Combat, exploration, social, arcane, and wilderness skills for heroic adventures.
- **Chapter 09: Horror/Mystery Genre Skills** — Investigation, psychological, occult, and survival skills for tense, investigative games.
- **Chapter 10: Modern Genre Skills** — Professional, technical, urban, and tactical skills for contemporary settings.
- **Chapter 11: Sci-Fi Genre Skills** — Piloting, engineering, science, and combat skills for space-faring campaigns.

Use the chapter that fits your game's genre. Mix and match skills across genres if your game blends tones (e.g., a cozy fantasy village game might use both Cozy and Fantasy skills).

For proficiencies that enhance these skills, see Chapters 13-17. For tags and conditions that modify skill checks, see Chapter 18.

Now, turn to the genre that fits your game and start exploring what your character can do.
