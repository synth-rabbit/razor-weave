# Chapter 18: Tags and Conditions Glossary {#tags-conditions-glossary}

This chapter is your comprehensive A-Z reference for tags and conditions. Use it during play for quick lookups when applying environmental modifiers, inflicting character states, or adjudicating interactions. Every entry includes specific mechanical effects, duration, clearing conditions, and GM usage guidance.

For conceptual overview of how tags and conditions work, see Chapter 04.

## How to Use This Glossary {#how-to-use}

**Tags** describe environments, situations, objects, or locations. They modify DCs, grant advantage or disadvantage, and shape position and effect. Tags are applied to scenes and locations, not characters.

**Conditions** represent persistent character states that modify capabilities. They attach to individual characters and follow them between scenes until cleared.

**Quick Navigation**: All entries are alphabetical within their category (Tags, then Conditions). Each entry has a stable anchor ID for cross-referencing. Quick reference tables appear at the end of this chapter for fast lookup by effect type.

## Tags Glossary {#tags-glossary}

### Alert {#tag-alert}

**Effect**: NPCs are actively searching or vigilant. +2 DC to Stealth-based actions and infiltration attempts.

**Duration**: Scene or until threat passes.

**How to Clear**: Eliminate perceived threat, wait for guards to stand down, create convincing false alarm.

**GM Usage**: Apply Alert when NPCs have been warned or recently discovered intruders. Partials on Stealth checks might trigger suspicion clocks or force characters into risky positions. Use Alert to create tense infiltration challenges where characters must choose between speed and caution.

---

### Ancient {#tag-ancient}

**Effect**: Structure, object, or location is old and potentially fragile or mysterious. +2 DC to historical knowledge checks. Objects may be Fragile (break easily) or Enchanted (retain magical properties).

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic property).

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared; mitigate by careful handling or scholarly preparation.

**GM Usage**: Apply Ancient to dungeons, artifacts, and ruins. Use it to signal both danger (crumbling architecture) and opportunity (lost knowledge, dormant magic). Partials on interaction might reveal partial lore or trigger structural decay. Ancient often pairs with Fragile, Enchanted, or Sacred Ground tags.

**Example**: The party discovers an ancient bridge spanning a chasm. Ancient + Fragile means they must cross carefully or risk collapse.

---

### Bloodstained {#tag-bloodstained}

**Effect**: Location shows evidence of violence. +2 DC to social checks (presence is unsettling). May attract predators or scavengers on failed checks.

**Duration**: Scene or until cleaned.

**How to Clear**: Clean the area, perform cleansing ritual, or leave location.

**GM Usage**: Apply Bloodstained to crime scenes, battlefields, and sacrifice sites. Use it to create tension and signal danger. Partials on investigation might reveal forensic clues but disturb evidence. In horror games, Bloodstained can trigger sanity checks or Frightened conditions.

**Example**: The detective investigates a bloodstained alley. The tag imposes disadvantage on calming witnesses but grants advantage on forensic checks.

---

### Bustling {#tag-bustling}

**Effect**: Location is full of activity and energy. Advantage on blending and gathering rumors. +2 DC to formal requests or serious conversations (too much noise and distraction).

**Duration**: Scene (typically during business hours or events).

**How to Clear**: Wait for closing time, clear the area, or move to quieter space.

**GM Usage**: Apply Bustling to markets, festivals, and crowded public spaces. Use it to enable stealth through crowds while hindering focused social interactions. Partials might gather incomplete information or accidentally draw attention while blending.

**Example**: The party blends into a bustling market to evade pursuit. Advantage on Stealth, but finding their contact requires overcoming +2 DC due to noise.

---

### Comforting {#tag-comforting}

**Effect**: Location is warm, safe, and welcoming. Advantage on checks to soothe, comfort, or build trust. Rests here are more effective (reduce recovery clocks by 1 segment).

**Duration**: Scene or while location remains hospitable.

**How to Clear**: Damage location, introduce threats, or violate hospitality.

**GM Usage**: Apply Comforting to hearths, safe havens, and welcoming homes. Use it to provide mechanical relief after tense scenes. Partials on social checks might build trust slowly or with minor misunderstandings. Let Comforting spaces feel genuinely restorative—they are rare sanctuaries in dangerous worlds.

**Example**: The party rests at a village hearthside. The Comforting tag reduces their recovery clock by 1 segment and grants advantage on gaining the innkeeper's trust.

---

### Corporate {#tag-corporate}

**Effect**: Space is controlled by corporate interests with strict protocols. +2 DC to access without proper credentials or appointments. Advantage on formal business interactions if properly credentialed.

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic to location).

**How to Clear**: Gain proper authorization, bypass security, or wait for public hours.

**GM Usage**: Apply Corporate to office buildings, labs, and secured facilities. Use it to create barriers that require social engineering, hacking, or infiltration. Partials might grant limited access or temporary passes. Corporate spaces often pair with Gatekeeper or By-the-Book tags.

**Example**: The runners need files from a corporate HQ. The Corporate tag means they need forged credentials or must hack the security system to gain access.

---

### Cramped {#tag-cramped}

**Effect**: Space is tight and restricts movement. Disadvantage on combat actions requiring space (large weapons, athletics maneuvers). May limit number of combatants who can engage simultaneously.

**Duration**: Locational (permanent) or scene (temporary obstruction).

**How to Clear**: Move to more open space or clear obstructions.

**GM Usage**: Apply Cramped to narrow corridors, small rooms, crowded spaces. Use it to create tactical challenges where positioning matters. Partials on movement might force characters into disadvantageous positions or knock objects loose. Cramped favors agile characters and small weapons.

**Example**: The duel occurs in a cramped alley. The fighter's greatsword suffers disadvantage, while the rogue's dagger does not.

---

### Crowded {#tag-crowded}

**Effect**: Space is filled with people. +2 DC to move quickly or perform obvious actions. Advantage on Stealth and blending into crowds.

**Duration**: Scene or event-based (market hours, festivals, rush hour).

**How to Clear**: Wait for crowd to disperse, clear area with authority, or move to less crowded location.

**GM Usage**: Apply Crowded to markets, festivals, protests, transit hubs. Use it to enable stealth while hindering movement. Partials on stealth might draw partial attention (someone notices, but loses sight in crowd). Crowded can separate party members or hide threats until they're dangerously close.

**Example**: The thief steals through a crowded square. Advantage on Stealth to blend, but +2 DC if they need to run.

---

### Cursed {#tag-cursed}

**Effect**: Location or object carries supernatural malevolence. Characters interacting may suffer Cursed, Hexed, or Weakened conditions on partial or failed checks. +2 DC to resist supernatural effects.

**Duration**: Permanent until cleansed or broken.

**How to Clear**: Perform cleansing ritual, break the curse, or destroy the cursed object/location.

**GM Usage**: Apply Cursed to haunted locations, dark artifacts, and forbidden sites. Use it to signal danger and escalate consequences. Partials might impose temporary conditions or trigger curse clocks. Cursed should feel genuinely dangerous—curses are not trivial inconveniences.

**Example**: The cursed blade grants power but inflicts the Cursed condition. The wielder must decide if the trade is worth the risk.

---

### Desecrated {#tag-desecrated}

**Effect**: Sacred location has been profaned. Disadvantage on divine magic or religious checks. Undead or malevolent forces may gain advantage in this space.

**Duration**: Permanent until re-consecrated.

**How to Clear**: Perform consecration ritual, remove source of defilement, restore sanctity.

**GM Usage**: Apply Desecrated to defiled temples, corrupted shrines, and profaned ground. Use it to signal corruption and create ritual challenges. Partials on consecration might partially restore sanctity or require additional components. Desecrated inversely mirrors Sacred Ground—what was blessed is now dangerous.

**Example**: The shrine is desecrated by cultists. The cleric's healing magic suffers disadvantage until the shrine is re-consecrated.

---

### Dim {#tag-dim}

**Effect**: Lighting is low (torches, moonlight, embers). Advantage on Stealth checks. Disadvantage on Perception checks and ranged attacks beyond short range.

**Duration**: Scene or until lighting improves.

**How to Clear**: Introduce bright light sources, wait for daylight, or move to well-lit area.

**GM Usage**: Apply Dim to dungeons, night scenes, and poorly lit interiors. Use it to favor stealth and create uncertainty. Partials on Perception might spot threats too late to avoid fully. Dim can escalate to Pitch Black (no vision without light sources).

**Example**: The rogue sneaks through a dim castle corridor. Advantage on Stealth, but disadvantage on spotting the tripwire.

---

### Divine {#tag-divine}

**Effect**: Location or object is touched by divine power. Advantage on religious checks and divine magic. May repel undead or unholy forces.

**Duration**: Permanent until desecrated or divine presence withdrawn.

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared by mortals; only divine withdrawal or desecration removes this tag.

**GM Usage**: Apply Divine to consecrated temples, blessed relics, and sites of miracles. Use it to provide mechanical benefits to faithful characters and create safe zones against supernatural threats. Partials on divine magic might grant temporary blessings or require offerings.

**Example**: The divine fountain grants advantage on Religion checks to commune with the deity and repels undead approaching within short range.

---

### Draconic {#tag-draconic}

**Effect**: Location or object has dragon-related properties. +2 DC to resist draconic magic or presence. May be warded against non-dragons or require dragon-blood to access.

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic property).

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared; mitigate through preparation or dragon-related knowledge.

**GM Usage**: Apply Draconic to dragon lairs, hoards, and ancient draconic sites. Use it to signal power and create access challenges. Partials might grant temporary access or reveal partial protections. Draconic often pairs with Ancient, Enchanted, or Hazardous tags.

**Example**: The draconic vault requires dragon blood to open. The party must negotiate with a dragon or find ancient dragon remains.

---

### Dread-Soaked {#tag-dread-soaked}

**Effect**: Location is saturated with fear and dread. Characters entering must resist Frightened condition (DC 16). Disadvantage on morale and courage checks.

**Duration**: Permanent until cleansed or dread-source removed.

**How to Clear**: Remove source of dread (defeat haunting entity, destroy cursed object), perform cleansing ritual, or abandon location.

**GM Usage**: Apply Dread-Soaked to haunted houses, torture chambers, and sites of great suffering. Use it to create psychological pressure and escalate horror. Partials on resistance might impose temporary Shaken or Distracted conditions instead. Dread-Soaked should feel oppressive and draining.

**Example**: The abandoned asylum is Dread-Soaked. Entering requires resisting Frightened (DC 16) or suffering disadvantage on all actions inside.

---

### Elevated {#tag-elevated}

**Effect**: Position is higher than surroundings. Advantage on ranged attacks against lower targets. Disadvantage on melee attacks against higher targets.

**Duration**: Positional (as long as height advantage maintained).

**How to Clear**: Move to level ground, ascend to equal height, or force opponent to lower ground.

**GM Usage**: Apply Elevated to towers, cliffs, rooftops, and high ground. Use it to reward tactical positioning and create vertical combat challenges. Partials on ranged attacks from elevation might hit but graze or consume extra ammunition.

**Example**: The archer positions on an elevated tower. Advantage on ranged attacks against ground targets, forcing enemies to approach or find their own high ground.

---

### Enchanted {#tag-enchanted}

**Effect**: Object or location is magically imbued. May grant advantage on specific actions, resist damage, or possess unusual properties. +2 DC to dispel or alter enchantments.

**Duration**: Permanent until dispelled or enchantment ends.

**How to Clear**: Dispel magic, break enchantment conditions, or destroy object.

**GM Usage**: Apply Enchanted to magical items, warded locations, and spell-infused environments. Use it to signal magic at work and create mysteries. Partials on identifying enchantments might reveal partial effects or activation requirements. Enchanted can be beneficial or dangerous depending on the magic's nature.

**Example**: The enchanted sword never dulls and grants advantage on attacks against fey. Dispelling requires DC 18 Arcana check.

---

### Forbidden {#tag-forbidden}

**Effect**: Location or object is restricted by law, custom, or supernatural prohibition. Accessing may trigger social consequences, legal repercussions, or supernatural backlash. +2 DC to access without authorization.

**Duration**: Permanent until prohibition lifted.

**How to Clear**: Gain authorization, change laws/customs, or break prohibition (with consequences).

**GM Usage**: Apply Forbidden to restricted archives, sacred sites, and illegal spaces. Use it to create moral dilemmas and access challenges. Partials might grant access but trigger suspicion or partial consequences. Forbidden often pairs with Cursed, Sacred Ground, or Gatekeeper tags.

**Example**: The forbidden archive requires guild master approval. Sneaking in triggers +2 DC and risks expulsion if caught.

---

### Fragile {#tag-fragile}

**Effect**: Structure or object breaks easily. Partial successes on interactions may damage or destroy. Failed checks likely cause collapse or breakage.

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic property) or scene (temporary weakening).

**How to Clear**: Reinforce structure, handle carefully, or accept breakage.

**GM Usage**: Apply Fragile to crumbling architecture, delicate objects, and damaged structures. Use it to create tension and consequences for rough actions. Partials might crack but not break fully, creating unstable conditions. Fragile often escalates into Hazardous when broken.

**Example**: The fragile bridge creaks underfoot. Crossing carefully requires DC 16 Athletics. Partial success cracks planks; failure collapses the bridge.

---

### Handmade {#tag-handmade}

**Effect**: Object is crafted with care and personal attention. Advantage on checks to appreciate craftsmanship or build rapport with creator. May grant small mechanical benefits (better durability, personal significance).

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic property).

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared; intrinsic to object's nature.

**GM Usage**: Apply Handmade to artisan goods, gifts, and crafted items. Use it to create social connections and signal care. Partials might reveal creator's intentions or partial history. Handmade often appears in cozy settings where relationships matter.

**Example**: The handmade quilt grants advantage on comfort checks and reminds the character of home, providing morale boost.

---

### Hazardous {#tag-hazardous}

**Effect**: Location contains immediate danger (fire, poison, radiation, unstable ground). Partial or failed checks may inflict conditions (Poisoned, Bleeding, Weakened, Exhausted). Lowers position in risky actions.

**Duration**: Scene or until hazard removed.

**How to Clear**: Remove hazard source (extinguish fire, ventilate poison, stabilize ground), avoid area, or protect against hazard.

**GM Usage**: Apply Hazardous to burning buildings, toxic environments, combat zones, and dangerous terrain. Use it to escalate consequences and create urgency. Partials might inflict minor conditions or damage. Hazardous should feel genuinely threatening—it's not decoration.

**Example**: The burning building is Hazardous. Failed Athletics checks to navigate debris inflict Weakened (smoke inhalation) or Bleeding (falling debris).

---

### High-Tech {#tag-high-tech}

**Effect**: Technology is advanced or cutting-edge. +2 DC to repair, hack, or understand without proper training. Advantage on tech-related tasks if properly skilled.

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic property).

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared; mitigate through training or tools.

**GM Usage**: Apply High-Tech to advanced labs, cyberware, and bleeding-edge systems. Use it to create skill gates and reward technical expertise. Partials might allow partial function or require specialized tools. High-Tech often pairs with Corporate, Prototype, or Volatile tags.

**Example**: Hacking the high-tech security system requires DC 18 without proper software. The netrunner has the tools, reducing DC to 14.

---

### Irradiated {#tag-irradiated}

**Effect**: Location is contaminated with radiation. Exposure risks Weakened or Poisoned conditions (DC 16 to resist). Extended exposure escalates conditions.

**Duration**: Permanent until decontaminated or decayed naturally (may take years).

**How to Clear**: Decontaminate area, use radiation shielding, or wait for decay.

**GM Usage**: Apply Irradiated to reactor zones, atomic blast sites, and contaminated labs. Use it to create danger zones and time pressure. Partials might resist immediate effects but suffer delayed symptoms. Irradiated creates hard limits—enter without protection and pay the price.

**Example**: The irradiated reactor core requires shielded suits. Without protection, characters suffer Weakened condition within minutes.

---

### Nanofabricated {#tag-nanofabricated}

**Effect**: Object is constructed with nanotechnology—precise, durable, potentially self-repairing. Advantage on durability and precision checks. +2 DC to repair without nanofab tools.

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic property).

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared; intrinsic to object's construction.

**GM Usage**: Apply Nanofabricated to advanced sci-fi equipment, medical devices, and cutting-edge tech. Use it to signal quality and create repair challenges. Partials on repair might restore partial function or require specialized components. Nanofabricated items are superior but depend on advanced infrastructure.

**Example**: The nanofabricated med-kit grants advantage on treating injuries but requires nanofab paste to reload.

---

### Obscuring {#tag-obscuring}

**Effect**: Visibility is reduced (fog, smoke, heavy rain, darkness). Advantage on contested Stealth checks. Disadvantage on Perception checks and ranged attacks.

**Duration**: Scene or until obscuration clears.

**How to Clear**: Wait for weather to clear, ventilate smoke, introduce light, or move to clear area.

**GM Usage**: Apply Obscuring to foggy nights, smoke-filled rooms, and heavy weather. Use it to favor stealth and create uncertainty. Partials on Perception might spot threats partially or too late to react fully. Obscuring can hide allies and enemies equally.

**Example**: Heavy fog (Obscuring) grants advantage on sneaking past sentries but imposes disadvantage on spotting the cliff edge.

---

### Patented {#tag-patented}

**Effect**: Technology or process is legally protected. Unauthorized use risks legal consequences. +2 DC to replicate without license or expertise.

**Duration**: Permanent until patent expires or is violated.

**How to Clear**: Acquire license, reverse-engineer (with legal risks), or wait for patent expiration.

**GM Usage**: Apply Patented to proprietary tech, corporate secrets, and protected designs. Use it to create legal complications and access challenges. Partials might allow partial replication or draw unwanted attention. Patented often pairs with Corporate or High-Tech tags.

**Example**: Reverse-engineering the patented cyberdeck requires DC 20 and risks corporate legal action if discovered.

---

### Prototype {#tag-prototype}

**Effect**: Technology is experimental and unproven. May grant powerful benefits but risks malfunction. On partials or failures, equipment may malfunction or break.

**Duration**: Permanent (until proven or abandoned).

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared; mitigate through testing and refinement.

**GM Usage**: Apply Prototype to cutting-edge gear, experimental weapons, and untested systems. Use it to create risk-reward decisions. Partials might provide partial benefits with drawbacks (weapon fires but overheats). Prototype should feel powerful but unreliable.

**Example**: The prototype plasma rifle deals massive damage but malfunctions on rolls of 10 or lower, requiring field repair before next use.

---

### Sacred Ground {#tag-sacred-ground}

**Effect**: Location is consecrated or holy. Advantage on divine magic and resistance against undead or unholy forces. May impose restrictions on certain actions (violence, lies, desecration).

**Duration**: Permanent until desecrated.

**How to Clear**: Desecrate location (with serious narrative consequences), or location ceases to be sacred through divine withdrawal.

**GM Usage**: Apply Sacred Ground to temples, shrines, consecrated cemeteries, and holy sites. Use it to provide sanctuary and mechanical benefits to faithful characters. Partials on divine magic might grant blessings with minor costs (offerings, oaths). Sacred Ground creates moral weight—violating it should have consequences.

**Example**: The sacred temple grants advantage vs undead and sanctuary from violence. Attacking inside profanes the space and angers the deity.

---

### Sentient {#tag-sentient}

**Effect**: Object possesses intelligence and agency. May cooperate, resist, or negotiate. Requires social interaction rather than pure skill checks.

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic property).

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared; object retains sentience unless destroyed or consciousness transferred.

**GM Usage**: Apply Sentient to intelligent weapons, AI systems, and awakened objects. Use it to create roleplay opportunities and complications. Partials on social checks might gain grudging cooperation or partial assistance. Sentient items are characters, not tools—treat them accordingly.

**Example**: The sentient sword advises on combat tactics but refuses to strike innocents. The wielder must negotiate or find another weapon.

---

### Silent {#tag-silent}

**Effect**: Location is unnaturally quiet—sound is dampened or absent. Advantage on Stealth (movement). Disadvantage on communication and hearing-based Perception. Unsettling atmosphere may impose psychological pressure.

**Duration**: Scene or permanent (supernatural silence).

**How to Clear**: Leave area, break supernatural effect, or introduce sound sources (may be difficult or impossible).

**GM Usage**: Apply Silent to haunted spaces, magical dead zones, and eerie locations. Use it to create tension and communication challenges. Partials on navigating might succeed quietly but miss audible warnings. Silent is especially effective in horror settings—what cannot be heard becomes more threatening.

**Example**: The silent forest grants advantage on sneaking but prevents warning calls. The party must use hand signals or risk separation.

---

### Slick {#tag-slick}

**Effect**: Surface is slippery (ice, oil, wet stone). Disadvantage on fast movement and Athletics checks. Risk of falling prone on failed checks.

**Duration**: Scene or until surface dries/clears.

**How to Clear**: Clean surface, wait for drying, apply traction (sand, salt), or move to dry ground.

**GM Usage**: Apply Slick to ice, wet floors, oil spills, and muddy ground. Use it to create movement challenges and tactical complications. Partials might succeed in moving but slowly or in uncontrolled directions. Slick can turn chases into desperate scrambles.

**Example**: The icy bridge (Slick) imposes disadvantage on crossing quickly. The fleeing character must choose: slow and safe, or fast and risky.

---

### Uncanny {#tag-uncanny}

**Effect**: Location or object feels wrong—disturbing and unnatural. Characters must resist Distracted or Shaken conditions (DC 14). +2 DC to stay focused on tasks.

**Duration**: Scene or permanent (supernatural wrongness).

**How to Clear**: Leave area, identify and remove source of wrongness, or become accustomed through repeated exposure.

**GM Usage**: Apply Uncanny to liminal spaces, body horror scenes, and reality distortions. Use it to create psychological pressure and horror. Partials might impose temporary unease or trigger minor conditions. Uncanny is subtler than Dread-Soaked—it's wrongness, not terror.

**Example**: The uncanny mannequin display forces characters to resist Distracted (DC 14) or suffer disadvantage on investigation checks.

---

### Volatile {#tag-volatile}

**Effect**: Object or environment is unstable and may react violently. Disadvantage on delicate interactions. Failures risk explosions, chemical reactions, or structural collapse.

**Duration**: Scene or permanent (intrinsic instability).

**How to Clear**: Stabilize (with appropriate skill checks), carefully extract volatile components, or abandon area.

**GM Usage**: Apply Volatile to explosives, unstable chemicals, magical instabilities, and damaged reactors. Use it to create tension and consequence. Partials might stabilize temporarily or trigger partial reactions. Volatile should feel like a ticking clock—success averts disaster, failure accelerates it.

**Example**: The volatile experimental chemical requires DC 18 to stabilize. Failure triggers explosion, damaging the lab and inflicting Bleeding on nearby characters.

---

### Weathered {#tag-weathered}

**Effect**: Object or location shows age and use—worn but enduring. May be Fragile in some respects but reliable in others. Advantage on checks to appreciate history or craftsmanship.

**Duration**: Permanent (intrinsic property).

**How to Clear**: Cannot be cleared; intrinsic to object's history.

**GM Usage**: Apply Weathered to old tools, family heirlooms, and aged structures. Use it to signal history and character. Partials might reveal stories or require repair before full use. Weathered often appears in cozy settings where history and continuity matter.

**Example**: The weathered axe belonged to the character's grandfather. It grants advantage on checks related to family history and morale but requires regular maintenance.

---

## Conditions Glossary {#conditions-glossary}

### Bleeding {#condition-bleeding}

**Effect**: Character is losing blood. Disadvantage on strenuous physical actions. Untreated Bleeding risks escalation to Critical Injury after prolonged exertion or time (GM discretion, often a clock).

**Duration**: Until treated.

**How to Clear**: Successful Medicine check (DC 14 for field treatment, DC 12 in clean conditions), magical healing, or rest with proper bandaging.

**GM Usage**: Apply Bleeding after combat injuries, traps, or accidents. Use it to create urgency—characters can function but are on a timer. Partials on treatment might slow bleeding without fully stopping it. Bleeding escalates if ignored—track with clocks if pressure mounts.

**Example**: The fighter takes a sword wound and gains Bleeding. They can fight but suffer disadvantage on Athletics. Without treatment, Bleeding escalates to Critical after the fight.

---

### Blinded {#condition-blinded}

**Effect**: Character cannot see. Disadvantage on all actions requiring sight (combat, navigation, perception). Advantage on actions where vision is irrelevant (listening, feeling).

**Duration**: Until sight restored.

**How to Clear**: Remove cause of blindness (remove blindfold, cure condition, end magical effect), wait for temporary effect to end, or adapt with other senses.

**GM Usage**: Apply Blinded from flash grenades, blinding spells, environmental hazards (sand, bright light). Use it to create tactical shifts—blinded characters must rely on allies or other senses. Partials on adaptation might allow limited function (sense general direction, avoid obstacles). Blinded is debilitating but not helpless.

**Example**: The flash grenade blinds the guard (Blinded for scene). They fire wildly (disadvantage) but can still call for help.

---

### Cursed {#condition-cursed}

**Effect**: Character is afflicted by supernatural curse. Specific effects vary by curse but typically impose disadvantage on certain actions, attract misfortune, or inflict conditions at intervals. Curses often worsen over time if untreated.

**Duration**: Until curse is broken.

**How to Clear**: Perform curse-breaking ritual, seek divine intervention, fulfill curse conditions, or destroy cursed object.

**GM Usage**: Apply Cursed from cursed items, enemy hexes, or supernatural punishments. Use it to create quests and consequences. Partials on curse-breaking might weaken curse without removing it. Curses should feel personal and narrative—tie them to character choices and story arcs.

**Example**: The cursed ring grants power but inflicts Cursed—the character suffers disadvantage on social checks and must feed the ring's hunger (kill or corrupt) weekly or suffer Weakened.

---

### Deafened {#condition-deafened}

**Effect**: Character cannot hear. Disadvantage on Perception checks relying on sound and communication via speech. Advantage on resisting sonic attacks.

**Duration**: Until hearing restored.

**How to Clear**: Remove cause of deafness (loud noise fades, cure condition, end magical effect), wait for temporary effect to end, or adapt with visual communication.

**GM Usage**: Apply Deafened from explosions, sonic attacks, or environmental hazards. Use it to create communication challenges and tactical shifts. Partials on adaptation might allow limited understanding (reading lips, feeling vibrations). Deafened complicates coordination but doesn't prevent action.

**Example**: The explosion deafens the soldier (Deafened for scene). They cannot hear commands but can fight and read hand signals.

---

### Distracted {#condition-distracted}

**Effect**: Character's focus is divided. Disadvantage on complex tasks requiring concentration (lockpicking, research, casting rituals). May miss obvious details.

**Duration**: Scene or until focus restored.

**How to Clear**: Remove distraction source, take moment to center/focus, or complete action that's monopolizing attention.

**GM Usage**: Apply Distracted from environmental distractions, emotional turmoil, or multitasking. Use it to represent minor mental load. Partials on resisting might reduce disadvantage to +2 DC instead. Distracted is temporary but meaningful—it makes precision tasks harder.

**Example**: The scholar is Distracted by worry about the upcoming trial. Disadvantage on research checks until they resolve the legal issue or take time to focus.

---

### Exhausted {#condition-exhausted}

**Effect**: Character is physically or mentally drained. Disadvantage on complex or strenuous actions. May need rest to recover fully.

**Duration**: Until full rest.

**How to Clear**: Full rest with food, water, and safety. Partial rest or stimulants might reduce severity temporarily but not cure.

**GM Usage**: Apply Exhausted after prolonged exertion, sleepless nights, or draining magic. Use it to represent attrition and create pacing. Partials on recovery might reduce Exhausted to Weakened or grant temporary reprieve. Exhausted should feel meaningful—it's not just description, it's mechanical consequence.

**Example**: After organizing the three-day festival, the event planner gains Exhausted. Disadvantage on complex tasks until a full night's rest and hearty meal.

---

### Frightened {#condition-frightened}

**Effect**: Character is afraid of specific source. Disadvantage on actions opposing or approaching the source of fear. May flee if fear becomes overwhelming.

**Duration**: Scene or until source removed/overcome.

**How to Clear**: Remove threat, gain distance and safety, receive calming support, or overcome fear through brave action.

**GM Usage**: Apply Frightened from horror, intimidation, or overwhelming threats. Use it to create psychological pressure and moral tests. Partials on overcoming might reduce disadvantage or allow limited action despite fear. Frightened reflects real terror—honor it by making it consequential.

**Example**: The investigator sees the monster and becomes Frightened. Disadvantage on actions while in its presence. They can fight but must overcome fear or flee.

---

### Hexed {#condition-hexed}

**Effect**: Character is afflicted by minor curse or magical malady. Specific effects vary but often impose disadvantage on particular actions, attract minor misfortune, or create ongoing complications.

**Duration**: Clock (typically 3-4 segments) or until dispelled.

**How to Clear**: Dispel magic, wait for hex to fade, fulfill hex conditions, or perform cleansing.

**GM Usage**: Apply Hexed from curses, fey mischief, or magical traps. Use it to create ongoing complications and quests. Partials on dispelling might weaken hex without removing it. Hexed is less severe than Cursed—it's magical inconvenience rather than doom.

**Example**: The fey hexes the character for rudeness. Hexed causes minor misfortunes (disadvantage on first social check each scene) until character performs an apology ritual.

---

### Mana-Drained {#condition-mana-drained}

**Effect**: Character's magical reserves are depleted. Disadvantage on casting spells or using magical abilities. May be unable to cast higher-level magic.

**Duration**: Rest or until magical energy restored.

**How to Clear**: Full rest, consume mana potions, meditate in magical nexus, or receive magical energy transfer.

**GM Usage**: Apply Mana-Drained after casting powerful spells, magical overuse, or energy-draining attacks. Use it to create resource management and pacing. Partials on recovery might restore partial reserves. Mana-Drained is the spellcaster's Exhausted—it gates their primary resource.

**Example**: The wizard casts the ritual and becomes Mana-Drained. Disadvantage on spellcasting until a full rest at a ley line.

---

### Obsessed {#condition-obsessed}

**Effect**: Character is fixated on particular goal, person, or object. Advantage on actions directly pursuing obsession. Disadvantage on unrelated actions. May ignore other priorities.

**Duration**: Until obsession satisfied or broken.

**How to Clear**: Satisfy obsession, confront and overcome fixation, or suffer consequence that breaks focus.

**GM Usage**: Apply Obsessed from intense focus, magical compulsion, or character choices. Use it to create drives and complications. Partials on resisting might allow temporary focus on other tasks. Obsessed can be empowering (advantage on pursuit) and limiting (disadvantage elsewhere)—make both matter.

**Example**: The detective becomes Obsessed with solving the case. Advantage on investigation checks related to the case, disadvantage on other responsibilities.

---

### Poisoned {#condition-poisoned}

**Effect**: Character is suffering from poison or toxin. Disadvantage on strenuous physical actions. May worsen over time if untreated (escalate to Weakened or suffer ongoing damage).

**Duration**: Until treated or rest.

**How to Clear**: Successful Medicine check to treat poison (DC 16), antidote, magical healing, or full rest (poison runs its course).

**GM Usage**: Apply Poisoned from traps, venomous creatures, contaminated food/water, or toxic environments. Use it to create urgency and consequences. Partials on treatment might reduce severity without curing. Poisoned can escalate—track with clocks if pressure mounts.

**Example**: The rogue triggers a poison needle trap and becomes Poisoned. Disadvantage on Athletics and combat until treated with antidote or Medicine (DC 16).

---

### Prone {#condition-prone}

**Effect**: Character is on the ground. Disadvantage on melee attacks. Ranged attacks against character from adjacent attackers have advantage. Movement costs extra effort.

**Duration**: Until character stands (uses movement/action).

**How to Clear**: Stand up as action or movement (may provoke opportunity attacks or require check in difficult conditions).

**GM Usage**: Apply Prone from knockdowns, explosions, failed Athletics checks, or combat maneuvers. Use it to create tactical complications. Partials on standing might allow standing but at disadvantage or in poor position. Prone is common in combat—make it feel tactical, not just punitive.

**Example**: The explosion knocks the soldier Prone. They suffer disadvantage on attacks until they spend movement to stand (risky under fire).

---

### Restrained {#condition-restrained}

**Effect**: Character's movement is restricted (bound, grappled, trapped). Cannot move freely. Disadvantage on physical actions requiring mobility. Attacks against restrained character may have advantage.

**Duration**: Until freed.

**How to Clear**: Break free (Athletics or Thievery check, DC varies by restraint), receive help from ally, or restrain source is removed.

**GM Usage**: Apply Restrained from grapples, bindings, traps, or environmental entanglement. Use it to create escape challenges and tactical complications. Partials on breaking free might loosen restraints or allow limited movement. Restrained removes agency—use it to create tension and stakes.

**Example**: The cultist binds the prisoner (Restrained). The prisoner can struggle to break free (DC 18 Athletics) or wait for allies to rescue them.

### Shaken {#condition-shaken}

**Effect**: Character is unsettled and unnerved. Disadvantage on morale checks and first action in stressful situations. Less severe than Frightened—unease rather than terror.

**Duration**: Scene or until confidence restored.

**How to Clear**: Receive encouragement, overcome challenge, remove source of unease, or rest.

**GM Usage**: Apply Shaken from near-misses, unsettling experiences, or psychological pressure. Use it to represent minor mental strain. Partials on overcoming might reduce disadvantage to +2 DC. Shaken is subtle—use it when full Frightened is too severe.

**Example**: The close call with the collapsing bridge leaves the character Shaken. Disadvantage on first action in next tense situation until they calm down.

---

### Stunned {#condition-stunned}

**Effect**: Character is dazed and cannot act effectively. Loses next action or acts at severe disadvantage (GM discretion). Cannot take reactions.

**Duration**: Brief (typically one round/action) or scene.

**How to Clear**: Time passes (condition fades after action lost), receive help from ally, or succeed on check to shake off effect.

**GM Usage**: Apply Stunned from concussive attacks, electrical shocks, overwhelming stimuli, or magical effects. Use it to create dramatic turning points and vulnerabilities. Partials on recovery might reduce duration or severity. Stunned is powerful—use it sparingly.

**Example**: The taser stuns the guard (Stunned for one round). They lose their next action, allowing the runner to escape.

---

### Weakened {#condition-weakened}

**Effect**: Character's physical capabilities are reduced. Reduced effect on physical actions (successes accomplish less, partials barely succeed). May impose disadvantage on particularly strenuous tasks.

**Duration**: Rest or treatment.

**How to Clear**: Full rest, treatment for underlying cause (disease, poison, curse), or magical healing.

**GM Usage**: Apply Weakened from disease, poison, radiation, curses, or extreme exertion. Use it to represent attrition and debilitation. Partials on treatment might reduce severity without curing. Weakened makes characters less effective without removing capability—they can act but accomplish less.

**Example**: The radiation exposure leaves the engineer Weakened. Physical tasks have reduced effect until treated at medical bay.
