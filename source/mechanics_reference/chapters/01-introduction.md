# Introduction {#introduction}

The Mechanics Reference Guide is your comprehensive resource for the technical details of this game system. Whether you are running a cozy village festival, delving into ancient dungeons, investigating occult mysteries, navigating modern conspiracies, or exploring distant star systems, this guide provides the mechanical foundation you need.

## What's Inside {#whats-inside}

This guide organizes mechanics by genre and function, making it easy to find exactly what you need when you need it:

- **Core Mechanics** (Chapters 1-5): Universal systems that apply across all genres, including DC ladders, outcome tiers, advantage and disadvantage, tags and conditions, and progress tracking through clocks.
- **Skills Reference** (Chapters 6-11): Fiction-first capabilities organized by genre. Each skill package includes default actions, DC ranges, synergies, and practical usage guidance for Cozy, Fantasy, Horror/Mystery, Modern, and Sci-fi settings.
- **Proficiencies Reference** (Chapters 12-17): Specialized training and mastery systems across four tiers (Novice, Trained, Expert, Master), with acquisition mechanics and downtime activities tailored to each genre.
- **Additional Reference** (Chapters 18-20): Comprehensive glossaries of tags and conditions, combat mechanics, and character progression systems.

## How to Use This Guide {#how-to-use}

The Mechanics Reference Guide serves two primary purposes:

**Quick Reference During Play**: Use the table of contents and stable anchor IDs to jump directly to specific rules. Every heading includes an anchor for deep linking, and cross-references guide you to related mechanics. Need to know the DC for a skill check? Check your genre's skill chapter. Wondering how a condition clears? Jump to the tags and conditions glossary.

**Deep Study and Preparation**: Read through entire sections to understand how mechanics interconnect. The core concepts chapter explains universal principles, while genre-specific chapters show how those principles adapt to different play styles. Examples throughout demonstrate mechanics in action across varied contexts.

## Integration with Other Guides {#integration}

This reference works alongside three companion guides:

- **Player Guide**: For player-facing procedures, character creation, and advancement from the player's perspective.
- **GM Guide**: For adjudication philosophy, scenario design, pacing tools, and running the table.
- **Storyteller Guide**: For narrative techniques, genre tone, story structure, and integrating mechanics with fiction.

The Mechanics Reference Guide provides the technical backbone these guides rely on. When the Player Guide mentions skill checks, it points here for the mechanics. When the GM Guide discusses pacing, it references clocks from this guide. When the Storyteller Guide explores genre tone, it links to genre-specific skills and proficiencies.

## Navigating Mechanics {#navigating-mechanics}

The system's mechanics interconnect in deliberate ways:

**Skills** define what characters can do. They are fiction-first capabilities with specific DC ranges and synergies. Your character's skills determine which actions are possible and how difficult they are.

**Proficiencies** represent specialized training that enhances skills. A character with the Baker proficiency gains advantages when using Baking or related skills. Proficiencies also unlock downtime activities and narrative opportunities.

**Tags** describe environmental and situational factors. A Dim tag might grant advantage on Stealth checks while raising the DC for Perception. Tags shape position and effect, making the world mechanically consequential.

**Conditions** represent character states that persist across actions. Exhausted, Frightened, or Poisoned conditions modify what characters can effectively do until cleared through rest, treatment, or other means.

**Clocks** track progress toward goals or mounting threats. They turn abstract time pressure into concrete segments, letting you see how close you are to completion or catastrophe.

These elements work together to create a flexible, fiction-first system. The DC ladder and outcome tiers provide consistent resolution, while genre-specific content ensures the mechanics serve your story's tone and priorities.

The chapters ahead unpack these systems in detail. Start with the core concepts to build your foundation, then explore genre-specific chapters as your table's needs evolve.
