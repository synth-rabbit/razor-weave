# Chapter 07: Cozy Genre Skills {#chapter-07}

Cozy games celebrate the everyday: baking bread, tending gardens, organizing festivals, caring for animals. These skills turn domestic challenges into meaningful moments. They are grounded in community, craft, and care—where the stakes are real but rarely violent, and success builds connection rather than conquest.

This chapter provides ready-to-use skills for cozy and slice-of-life games. Use these skills when your game focuses on village life, rural communities, artisan crafts, or pastoral adventures. Mix them with Fantasy skills (Chapter 08) for cozy fantasy settings.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Cozy skills emphasize:

- **Domestic Mastery**: Cooking, homemaking, hospitality—skills that create comfort and belonging.
- **Artisan Crafts**: Baking, knitting, pottery, woodworking—skills that produce tangible, meaningful goods.
- **Community Connection**: Gossip, comfort, mediation—skills that build and maintain social bonds.
- **Nature Harmony**: Gardening, animal husbandry, foraging—skills that work with the land rather than against it.

Cozy skills rarely involve direct conflict. Instead, they navigate social dynamics, solve logistical problems, and create beauty. The tension comes from time pressure, resource scarcity, or emotional stakes—will the pie win the contest? Will the festival happen on time? Will the injured lamb recover?

For proficiencies that enhance these skills, see Chapter 13 (Cozy Proficiencies). For tags and conditions, see Chapter 18.
