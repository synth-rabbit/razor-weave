# Chapter 19: Combat Mechanics Reference {#combat-mechanics-reference}

Combat in this system is fiction-first and consequence-driven. Fights are not separate from the narrative—they are tense scenes where position, timing, and environment shape outcomes as much as skill. This chapter provides quick reference for combat structure, actions, positioning, and genre-specific examples.

For skill details, see Chapters 06-11. For tags and conditions affecting combat, see Chapter 18.

---

## Turn Structure {#turn-structure}

Combat flows narratively rather than through rigid initiative systems. The GM determines when action becomes structured turn-based play based on pacing and tension.

### When to Use Turn-Based Combat {#when-turn-based}

**Use structured turns when**:
- Multiple combatants act simultaneously and order matters
- Positioning, timing, and action economy are tactically significant
- Players benefit from clarity about who acts when

**Stay narrative when**:
- Combat is one-sided (ambush, overwhelming force)
- Fiction determines outcome (surprise attack, environmental kill)
- Structured turns slow pacing without adding tension

### Initiative (Optional) {#initiative}

If using initiative, keep it simple:

**Narrative Initiative**: GM determines order based on fiction. Who has advantage? Who strikes first? Who is caught flat-footed?

**Simple Roll**: Each combatant rolls d20. Highest goes first. Re-roll ties or let tied characters act simultaneously.

**Speed-Based**: Fast actions (drawing weapon, shouting warning) go before slow actions (casting ritual, reloading crossbow). GM adjudicates.

**GM Guidance**: Initiative is a tool, not a rule. Use it when it clarifies action. Drop it when it slows play without benefit.

---

## Action Economy {#action-economy}

On your turn, you can typically:

- **Move** up to your movement range (close/near/far zones, or specific distances if using maps)
- **Take one action** (attack, defend, maneuver, use item, help ally, other)
- **Take one reaction** (respond to enemy action, if triggered)

**GM Guidance**: Keep action economy simple. If a player wants to do something reasonable (draw weapon while moving, shout while attacking), allow it unless it grants unfair advantage. Fiction-first means bending rules when it makes sense.

---

## Combat Actions {#combat-actions}

### Attack {#action-attack}

**Description**: Strike an opponent with weapon, spell, or improvised object.

**Default DCs**:
- **Unaware Target**: DC 12 (surprise attack, target doesn't know you're there)
- **Aware Target**: DC 14-16 (standard combat engagement)
- **Defended Target**: DC 18-20 (target actively defending, armored, behind cover)

**Outcomes**:
- **Success**: Deal damage, achieve tactical goal (disarm, knock prone, push back).
- **Partial**: Deal reduced damage or achieve goal with cost (counterattack, lose position, consume resource).
- **Failure**: Miss, opponent gains advantage (counterattack, repositioning, morale boost).

**Modifiers**: Elevated (adv ranged from high ground), Dim (disadv ranged beyond short), Obscuring (disadv perception, adv stealth), Prone (disadv attacker, adv adjacent ranged attacks on prone target).

**GM Guidance**: Attacks should feel dynamic. Partials hit but glance off armor, or strike true but leave you exposed. Failures should complicate—missed shots alert guards, wild swings break cover, empty magazines require reloads.

---

### Defend {#action-defend}

**Description**: Actively protect yourself or ally from harm.

**Default DCs**:
- **Block/Parry Attack**: Opposed check vs attacker
- **Take Cover**: DC 14 (find and use available cover)
- **Protect Ally**: DC 16-18 (intercept attack meant for someone else)

**Outcomes**:
- **Success**: Negate attack, avoid harm, protect ally fully.
- **Partial**: Reduce damage or consequences, but suffer cost (condition, disadvantage, lose position).
- **Failure**: Defense fails, take full attack or worse consequences.

**Modifiers**: Fragile (cover breaks on partial/fail), Cramped (hard to maneuver defensively), Elevated (harder to defend from low ground).

**GM Guidance**: Defense is active and interesting. Partials might block but lose shield, or dodge but end up Prone. Let defending matter—it's not just "lose your turn."

---

### Maneuver {#action-maneuver}

**Description**: Tactical action to gain position, create advantage, or disrupt enemy.

**Default DCs**:
- **Gain High Ground**: DC 14-16 (climb, jump, reposition to elevation)
- **Flank Opponent**: DC 14 (coordinate with ally to attack from multiple sides)
- **Disarm/Trip**: DC 16-18 (opposed check, remove weapon or knock prone)
- **Create Distraction**: DC 14-16 (draw attention, enable ally action)

**Outcomes**:
- **Success**: Gain advantage (adv on next action), impose disadvantage on enemy, or change battlefield state.
- **Partial**: Achieve goal partially or temporarily, possibly at cost.
- **Failure**: Maneuver fails, enemy capitalizes (you're exposed, they gain advantage).

**Modifiers**: Slick (disadv fast movement), Cramped (limited maneuver space), Crowded (hard to move, easy to blend).

**GM Guidance**: Maneuvers create tactical depth. Let players describe creative actions and reward them mechanically. Partials might grant temporary advantage or enable one ally to capitalize. Maneuvers should feel like smart plays, not wasted turns.

---

### Use Item {#action-use-item}

**Description**: Deploy equipment, consume potion, activate device.

**Default DCs**:
- **Simple Item** (drink potion, light torch): No check or DC 10
- **Complex Item** (activate tech, set trap): DC 14-16
- **Under Pressure** (use item while under fire, threatened): +2 DC

**Outcomes**:
- **Success**: Item functions as intended.
- **Partial**: Item works but imperfectly (partial effect, delayed activation, resource cost).
- **Failure**: Item fails, breaks, or triggers unintended consequence.

**Modifiers**: High-Tech (requires training, +2 DC without), Prototype (risk malfunction), Volatile (risk explosion/reaction).

**GM Guidance**: Items solve problems. Potions heal but taste vile (roleplay moment). Tech activates but draws attention. Partials create tension—grenade thrown but bounces unpredictably, medkit applied but supplies depleted.

---

### Help {#action-help}

**Description**: Assist an ally's action, granting them advantage or reducing DC.

**Default DCs**:
- **Grant Advantage**: DC 14 (describe how you help, grant ally advantage on their next check)
- **Reduce DC**: DC 16 (exceptional help reduces ally's DC by 2)
- **Enable Impossible Action**: DC 18-20 (your help makes something possible that wasn't before)

**Outcomes**:
- **Success**: Ally gains advantage or DC reduction.
- **Partial**: Ally gains benefit but you suffer cost (exposed position, resource spent, condition).
- **Failure**: Help fails, possibly hindering ally or exposing both.

**Modifiers**: Cramped (hard to coordinate), Crowded (allies separated), Teamwork proficiency (advantage on help actions).

**GM Guidance**: Help actions enable teamwork and spotlight moments. Let players describe creative assistance and reward it. Partials might grant advantage but at cost (you draw fire, you're Prone afterward). Help should feel heroic and tactical.

---

## Position in Combat {#position-in-combat}

Position matters. High ground, cover, range, and flanking shape combat outcomes.

### Cover {#position-cover}

**Partial Cover** (Half-exposed): Attackers suffer +2 DC or disadvantage on ranged attacks.

**Full Cover** (Fully concealed): Cannot be targeted directly. Attackers must flush target out or reposition.

**Fragile Cover** (Breakable): Provides cover until attacked or stressed. Partial successes or failures may destroy cover (apply Fragile tag).

**GM Guidance**: Cover degrades. Partials on attacks might hit cover instead of target, eroding protection. Let players create cover (flip tables, use shields) and enemies destroy it.

**Example**: The runner ducks behind a concrete barrier (full cover). The corporate security can't shoot directly but can flank or use grenades to flush them out.

---

### Elevation {#position-elevation}

**High Ground**: Advantage on ranged attacks against lower targets. Disadvantage on melee attacks from lower ground against higher opponents.

**Low Ground**: Disadvantage on attacks against elevated opponents. Hard to see or target elevated enemies (may grant cover).

**GM Guidance**: Elevation creates tactical choices. Players should seek high ground for ranged combat. Climbing under fire is risky—apply Slick, Fragile, or Hazardous tags to vertical surfaces.

**Example**: The archer climbs the tower (Elevated tag). Advantage on ranged attacks against courtyard enemies. Enemies must climb or find ranged weapons to respond effectively.

---

### Flanking {#position-flanking}

**Flanked**: Target is surrounded or attacked from multiple directions. Attackers gain advantage or defenders suffer disadvantage (GM discretion based on fiction).

**GM Guidance**: Flanking rewards positioning and teamwork. Let players coordinate to flank and enemies do the same. Flanking isn't automatic—it requires positioning and opportunity.

**Example**: Two fighters coordinate to flank the ogre. Both roll with advantage as they attack from opposite sides, splitting the ogre's attention.

---

### Range Bands {#position-range}

**Close** (Melee/touch range): Melee weapons, grappling, immediate interaction.

**Near** (Thrown weapons, short-range firearms): Reliable ranged attacks, clear communication.

**Far** (Bows, rifles, long-range weapons): Disadvantage without clear line of sight or appropriate weapon. Obscuring, Dim, or distance impose penalties.

**GM Guidance**: Range matters for targeting and tactics. Dim lighting imposes disadvantage on Far range. Obscuring helps at all ranges. Let players close distance or create space tactically.

---

## Environmental Effects in Combat {#environmental-effects}

Tags shape combat dramatically. Use them to create dynamic, memorable fights.

### Cramped Spaces {#env-cramped}

**Effect**: Large weapons suffer disadvantage. Movement restricted. Hard to maneuver or flank.

**Tactical Implications**: Favor small weapons (daggers, pistols). Grappling becomes viable. Archers struggle.

**Example**: The tavern brawl (Cramped). Greatswords are useless, but fists, daggers, and thrown mugs excel.

---

### Elevated Combat {#env-elevated}

**Effect**: High ground grants advantage on ranged attacks. Low ground suffers disadvantage against elevated foes.

**Tactical Implications**: Control high ground. Force enemies to climb or close distance. Archers dominate.

**Example**: The castle wall fight. Defenders on walls have advantage; attackers must scale walls (Slick, Fragile) under fire.

---

### Hazardous Environments {#env-hazardous}

**Effect**: Failures or partials inflict conditions (Poisoned, Bleeding, Weakened). Environment actively threatens combatants.

**Tactical Implications**: Quick resolution preferred. Prolonged fights increase casualties. Use environment against enemies.

**Example**: The burning building (Hazardous). Every round risks Weakened (smoke inhalation) or Bleeding (falling debris). Players must rescue hostage and escape quickly.

---

### Obscuring Conditions {#env-obscuring}

**Effect**: Fog, smoke, darkness reduce visibility. Advantage on Stealth, disadvantage on Perception and ranged attacks.

**Tactical Implications**: Melee favored. Stealth becomes viable mid-combat. Ranged weapons struggle.

**Example**: The foggy docks (Obscuring). The smuggler uses fog to vanish mid-fight (advantage on Stealth), forcing guards into melee or blind shots (disadvantage on ranged).

---

### Slick Surfaces {#env-slick}

**Effect**: Fast movement and Athletics checks suffer disadvantage. Risk falling Prone on failures.

**Tactical Implications**: Slow, careful movement preferred. Charging or fleeing is risky.

**Example**: The icy bridge (Slick). The duel requires careful footing. Fast attacks risk falling Prone; patient fighters have advantage.

---

## Conditions in Combat {#conditions-in-combat}

Conditions dramatically affect combat capability. Apply them as consequences and narrative drivers.

### Prone {#cond-prone}

**Combat Effect**: Disadvantage on melee attacks. Ranged attacks against prone target from adjacent range have advantage. Standing requires movement/action.

**Tactical Use**: Knock enemies Prone (trip, explosive force) to create vulnerability. Prone characters should stand or suffer consequences.

**Example**: The grenade knocks the soldier Prone. Enemies have advantage on ranged attacks until soldier spends action to stand (risky under fire).

---

### Restrained {#cond-restrained}

**Combat Effect**: Cannot move. Disadvantage on physical actions. Attacks against restrained target may have advantage.

**Tactical Use**: Grapple or trap enemies to neutralize threats. Restrained characters must break free or rely on allies.

**Example**: The wrestler grapples the assassin (Restrained). Assassin suffers disadvantage on attacks and cannot flee until breaking free (opposed Athletics check).

---

### Blinded {#cond-blinded}

**Combat Effect**: Disadvantage on attacks and perception. Cannot target at range effectively. Advantage on actions where vision is irrelevant.

**Tactical Use**: Flash grenades, blinding spells, or sand in eyes create openings. Blinded enemies are vulnerable.

**Example**: The flash grenade blinds the guard (Blinded for scene). Guard fires wildly (disadvantage), enabling runner to escape.

---

### Stunned {#cond-stunned}

**Combat Effect**: Lose next action or act at severe disadvantage. Cannot take reactions.

**Tactical Use**: Stun high-priority targets to create openings or neutralize threats temporarily.

**Example**: The taser stuns the guard (Stunned for one round). Guard loses action, allowing team to breach door unopposed.

---

### Frightened {#cond-frightened}

**Combat Effect**: Disadvantage on actions opposing source of fear. May flee if overwhelmed.

**Tactical Use**: Intimidate or terrify enemies to break morale. Frightened enemies are easier to defeat or route.

**Example**: The dragon's roar Frightens the bandits. They suffer disadvantage on attacks against it and may flee if fight goes poorly.

---

### Bleeding, Poisoned, Weakened {#cond-attrition}

**Combat Effect**: Disadvantage or reduced effect on physical actions. Worsen over time if untreated.

**Tactical Use**: Apply through traps, environmental hazards, or special attacks. Create attrition and urgency.

**Example**: The poisoned blade inflicts Poisoned condition. Target fights at disadvantage and worsens without antidote.

---

## Combat Examples by Genre {#combat-examples}

### Cozy: Cooking Contest {#example-cozy}

**Setup**: Annual baking competition. Five contestants, three rounds, escalating complexity. Stakes: village bragging rights and artisan guild recognition.

**Conflict Structure**: Skill challenges (Cooking, Presentation) rather than violence. Opponents are rivals, not enemies.

**Tags**: Bustling (crowded festival), Comforting (supportive audience), Fragile (delicate pastries), Handmade (personal recipes).

**Actions**:
- **Attack**: Outperform rival (Cooking check vs their result)
- **Defend**: Salvage mistake (prevent Distracted or Exhausted conditions)
- **Maneuver**: Impress judges (gain advantage on next round)
- **Help**: Assist fellow contestant (builds reputation, grants advantage)

**Conditions**: Distracted (rival's flourish unsettles), Exhausted (final round fatigue).

**Outcome**: Success wins round. Partial impresses but falls short. Failure creates setback (burned dish, dropped plate). Final winner determined by accumulated successes and judge favor.

**Example Exchange**:
- **Round 1**: Player rolls Cooking (DC 16). Success—their pie is golden perfection. Rival rolls partial—good but crust cracks.
- **Round 2**: Bustling tag distracts player (+2 DC). Player rolls partial—dish is good but plating rushed. Rival succeeds—immaculate presentation.
- **Round 3**: Player uses Help action to encourage nervous contestant (advantage granted). Then rolls own dish (DC 18). Success—showstopping finale. Player wins contest, earns Artisan reputation tag.

### Fantasy: Dungeon Fight with Environmental Hazards {#example-fantasy}

**Setup**: Party fights goblins in collapsing ruins. Ancient pillars crack, floor is Slick (moss and water), torches provide Dim light, ceiling is Fragile.

**Combatants**: 3 PCs vs 5 goblins. Goblins know terrain, use hit-and-run tactics.

**Tags**: Dim (low light), Slick (wet floor), Fragile (crumbling ceiling), Hazardous (collapse risk), Cramped (tight corridors).

**Turn 1**:
- **Fighter** attacks goblin (DC 16, standard combat). Rolls 18 (success)—sword strike fells goblin.
- **Rogue** uses Maneuver to gain Elevated position on crumbling stairs (DC 14 Athletics). Rolls 15 (success)—now has advantage on ranged attacks.
- **Wizard** casts spell to collapse ceiling on goblins (DC 18 Arcana). Rolls 16 (partial)—ceiling cracks but doesn't fall. Creates Hazardous zone; goblins must dodge or risk Bleeding.
- **Goblins** retreat, using Dim tag for advantage on Stealth. Two vanish into shadows; three attack party from cover.

**Turn 2**:
- **Fighter** charges goblins on Slick floor (DC 16 Melee + disadvantage for Slick). Rolls 14 (fail)—slips, falls Prone. Goblins gain advantage.
- **Rogue** shoots from Elevated position (advantage). Rolls 19 (success)—arrow hits goblin, forcing it into Hazardous zone. Ceiling collapses (GM trigger), inflicting Bleeding condition on goblin.
- **Wizard** helps Fighter stand (DC 14 Help action). Rolls 15 (success)—Fighter can act next turn without spending action to rise.
- **Goblins** attack Prone Fighter with advantage. Roll 17 (success)—Fighter takes hit, suffers Bleeding condition.

**Turn 3**:
- **Fighter** uses Defend action to block goblin attacks while Rogue and Wizard handle threats.
- **Rogue** shoots final goblin (advantage from elevation). Rolls 20 (success)—clean kill.
- **Wizard** stabilizes Fighter's Bleeding (Medicine DC 14). Rolls partial—Bleeding slowed but Fighter is Weakened until rest.

**Outcome**: Party wins but pays cost. Fighter is Weakened, wizard used spell slot, ruins partially collapsed (escape harder). Goblins' hit-and-run tactics and environmental knowledge made fight dangerous despite numerical inferiority.

### Horror: Desperate Escape from Pursuing Threat {#example-horror}

**Setup**: Investigator flees unseen horror through Dim, Obscuring fog in abandoned hospital. Goal: reach exit before horror catches them. This is chase scene, not stand-up fight.

**Threat**: Unseen horror (stat-less, GM-controlled narrative force). Represents terror, not tactical enemy.

**Tags**: Dim (emergency lights), Obscuring (fog/dust), Fragile (decayed floor), Silent (unnaturally quiet), Dread-Soaked (horror presence).

**Structure**: Clocks. Escape Progress (6 segments, investigator). Pursuit Progress (6 segments, horror). Investigator wins by filling Escape clock first.

**Turn 1**:
- **Investigator** runs through corridors (DC 14 Athletics to advance Escape clock). Rolls 17 (success)—advances 2 segments. But Fragile floor cracks underfoot (partial consequence). Noise advances Pursuit clock by 1.
- **Horror** advances automatically (GM narrates sounds, movement, presence growing closer).

**Turn 2**:
- **Investigator** uses Stealth to hide in office (DC 16, uses Obscuring for advantage). Rolls partial—hidden but cramped, suffers Distracted condition. Pursuit clock doesn't advance this turn (horror searches elsewhere).
- **Horror** searches (GM describes scraping sounds, breathing, shadows moving). Tension mounts.

**Turn 3**:
- **Investigator** resists Frightened condition (DC 16 Composure due to Dread-Soaked tag). Rolls fail—becomes Frightened. Disadvantage on actions opposing horror (running toward it, confronting it).
- **Investigator** chooses to flee rather than hide (smart choice given Frightened). Rolls Athletics (DC 14 + disadvantage). Rolls 15 (partial due to disadvantage)—advances Escape clock by 1 but crashes through Fragile door. Loud noise advances Pursuit clock by 2. Horror is close.

**Turn 4**:
- **Investigator** spots exit ahead. Rolls final Athletics (DC 16, Frightened disadvantage). Rolls 18 despite disadvantage (success)—bursts through exit, slams door, escapes into night. Escape clock fills.
- **Horror** reaches door moments later. Investigator escapes but is Frightened and Exhausted. Barely survived.

**Outcome**: Investigator escapes but mentally scarred. Frightened and Exhausted conditions persist. Horror remains threat—undefeated, merely evaded. Scene establishes horror's power and investigator's vulnerability.

### Modern: Urban Gunfight with Cover Mechanics {#example-modern}

**Setup**: Corporate runner vs security team in parking garage. Cover abundant (cars, pillars). Range matters. Tactical positioning key.

**Combatants**: 1 runner vs 3 security guards. Guards have numbers, runner has skill and surprise.

**Tags**: Cramped (garage), Dim (emergency lighting), Crowded (parked cars = cover), Fragile (car windows), Corporate (security protocols).

**Turn 1**:
- **Runner** uses surprise to attack Guard 1 from cover (DC 14, unaware target). Rolls 18 (success)—silenced pistol drops guard quietly.
- **Guard 2** spots body, calls alert (Alert tag applied). Raises DC for stealth to +2.
- **Guard 3** takes cover behind car (full cover). Cannot be targeted directly.

**Turn 2**:
- **Runner** uses Maneuver to flank Guard 3 (DC 14). Rolls 16 (success)—repositions to angle on guard, negating cover.
- **Guard 3** fires at runner (DC 16). Rolls partial—shot hits car next to runner (Fragile tag), shattering window. Glass shards inflict minor Bleeding condition on runner.
- **Guard 2** advances while firing (DC 18, shooting while moving). Rolls fail—misses, wastes ammunition.

**Turn 3**:
- **Runner** shoots Guard 3 now that cover is negated (DC 16). Rolls 19 (success)—guard down.
- **Guard 2** retreats to call reinforcements (tactical withdrawal). Runner can engage or flee before backup arrives.

**Runner Choice**: Flee. Goal was data theft, not firefight. Uses Crowded (cars) and Dim tags to vanish before reinforcements arrive.

**Outcome**: Runner completes objective (data acquired) but suffers Bleeding condition and Alert tag follows (corporate security knows intruder was present). Escape clean but not unscathed. Consequences will follow (corporate response clock starts).

---

### Sci-Fi: Zero-G Battle Aboard Space Station {#example-scifi}

**Setup**: Marines board derelict station to investigate. Encounter hostile aliens in zero-gravity hangar. Microgravity changes combat dynamics.

**Combatants**: 2 marines vs 3 aliens. Aliens adapted to zero-g; marines are not.

**Tags**: Microgravity (Cramped equivalent for movement), Obscuring (venting atmosphere), Hazardous (Hard Vacuum if suit breached), Dim (emergency lighting), Fragile (hull integrity).

**Turn 1**:
- **Marine 1** fires rifle at alien (DC 16, microgravity makes aiming harder). Rolls partial—hits alien but recoil sends marine spinning. Marine suffers Distracted condition (must stabilize before next action).
- **Marine 2** uses mag-boots to anchor and fire (DC 14, stable platform). Rolls 18 (success)—clean hit, alien injured.
- **Aliens** use zero-g maneuverability (advantage on movement). One flanks, two coordinate attack.

**Turn 2**:
- **Marine 1** uses thrusters to stabilize (DC 14 Athletics). Rolls 15 (success)—Distracted cleared, can act normally.
- **Marine 2** defends against flanking alien (opposed check). Rolls partial—blocks but loses position, drifts into Hazardous zone (exposed to venting atmosphere).
- **Aliens** press advantage. One attacks Marine 2 in Hazardous zone (DC 16). Rolls success—breaches marine's suit. Marine begins suffocating (Weakened condition, escalates if not sealed).

**Turn 3**:
- **Marine 1** shoots alien threatening Marine 2 (DC 16). Rolls 19 (success)—alien eliminated.
- **Marine 2** uses emergency sealant on suit (DC 14 Use Item under pressure). Rolls partial—suit sealed but sealant depleted. No more repairs possible. Weakened condition persists until proper repair.
- **Aliens** retreat into station depths. Marines have won hangar but are injured and low on resources.

**Outcome**: Marines secure hangar but Marine 2 is Weakened and suit integrity compromised. Must decide: press on with damaged gear or retreat for repairs. Microgravity and environmental hazards made fight more dangerous than ground combat would have been. Aliens remain threat deeper in station.

## GM Guidance: Running Dynamic Combat {#gm-guidance}

**Make environment matter**: Use tags actively. Fragile cover breaks. Slick floors cause slips. Dim light hides threats. Environment should shape tactics, not just flavor.

**Position is tactical**: High ground, cover, flanking, and range create meaningful choices. Let players maneuver for advantage and enemies do the same.

**Conditions drive consequences**: Combat inflicts conditions, not just damage. Bleeding creates urgency. Frightened breaks morale. Stunned creates openings. Use conditions to make fights memorable.

**Partials create drama**: Partial successes hit but at cost. Shields break. Ammunition depletes. Positions are lost. Partials keep fights tense and dynamic.

**Not all fights are to the death**: Enemies flee when losing. Players can intimidate, negotiate, or escape. Combat is scene type, not required endpoint.

**Failure forward**: Failed attacks miss but create complications (alert guards, break cover, waste ammunition). Failures should drive story, not stall it.

For detailed skill mechanics, see Chapters 06-11. For comprehensive tag and condition effects, see Chapter 18. For narrative combat guidance, see the GM Guide.
