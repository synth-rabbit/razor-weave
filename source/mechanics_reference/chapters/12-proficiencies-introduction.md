# Chapter 12: Proficiencies Introduction {#proficiencies-introduction}

Proficiencies represent the specialized training and mastery that separates someone who dabbles from someone who dedicates. Where skills define broad capabilities, proficiencies sharpen specific techniques into reliable advantages. They transform uncertain attempts into confident actions, reducing DCs, granting advantage, and unlocking possibilities that would otherwise be closed.

## What Proficiencies Represent {#what-proficiencies-represent}

Proficiencies are the product of deliberate practice. They reflect drills, repetitions, apprenticeships, and hard-won insights. A character with the Baker proficiency does not merely know how to mix ingredients—they understand temperature curves, rising times, and how to coax flavor from simple flour. A character with the Forensics proficiency does not just examine crime scenes—they preserve chain of custody, recognize trace evidence patterns, and extract information others would overlook.

Mechanically, proficiencies offer concrete advantages:
- Reducing DCs by 2-4 points in specific situations
- Granting advantage on checks related to their specialty
- Unlocking new actions entirely (crafting complex items, performing specialized techniques)
- Reducing downtime clocks or speeding progress on long-term projects
- Providing synergies with related skills, tags, or conditions

Narratively, proficiencies define expertise and identity. They signal what a character has invested time mastering, what communities they belong to, and what doors are open to them. A character with Court Etiquette moves differently in formal settings than one without. A character with Network Admin thinks in systems diagrams. These are not just mechanical benefits—they are lenses that shape how characters perceive and solve problems.

## Proficiency Tiers {#proficiency-tiers}

Proficiencies progress through four tiers, each reflecting deepening mastery:

**Novice (N)**: Basic familiarity with the proficiency's techniques. You have completed foundational training and can perform routine tasks with confidence, but complex situations still challenge you. Novice proficiencies typically grant advantage on simple checks or reduce DCs by 2 in straightforward contexts.

**Trained (T)**: Professional competence. You have internalized the fundamentals and can handle most situations that arise in your specialty. Trained proficiencies grant advantage on a broader range of checks, reduce DCs by 2-3, and often unlock specialized techniques or downtime activities unavailable to novices.

**Expert (E)**: Exceptional mastery. You are recognized as an authority in your field, capable of handling complex challenges and teaching others. Expert proficiencies grant significant advantages (advantage plus DC reduction, or DC reduction of 4+), unlock advanced techniques, and provide leadership benefits when coordinating others in your specialty.

**Master (M)**: Peak achievement. You have reached the limits of what is commonly known in your proficiency and may have developed unique techniques or insights. Master proficiencies grant game-changing abilities, allow you to attempt the near-impossible, and often provide benefits to allies or reshape entire scenes. Masters are rare—most campaigns will feature only a handful of master-tier proficiencies across all characters.

## Acquiring Proficiencies {#acquiring-proficiencies}

Proficiencies are not gained through simple experience or abstract advancement points. They require dedicated downtime training, access to mentors or instructional materials, and narrative justification.

### Training Requirements {#training-requirements}

To acquire or advance a proficiency, a character must:

1. **Find a Teacher or Resource**: A mentor with the proficiency at the desired tier or higher, a guild that offers structured training, instructional texts (for some knowledge-based proficiencies), or extended practice in the field.

2. **Commit Downtime**: Training takes time. The exact duration depends on the tier and campaign pacing, but typical benchmarks are:
   - Novice: 1-2 downtime sessions (weeks to a month)
   - Trained: 2-4 downtime sessions (1-3 months)
   - Expert: 4-8 downtime sessions (3-6 months)
   - Master: 8-12+ downtime sessions (6-12+ months)

3. **Pay Costs**: Training is not free. Costs scale by tier and may include:
   - Novice: Modest fees (enough to cover materials and a teacher's time)
   - Trained: Significant investment (tuition, equipment, guild dues)
   - Expert: Substantial costs (rare materials, specialized instruction, research)
   - Master: Major commitments (unique quests, rare favors, legendary components)

4. **Demonstrate Aptitude**: At the GM's discretion, advancing a proficiency may require a final test—a check or challenge that proves the character has internalized the training.

### Mentors and Guilds {#mentors-guilds}

The fiction of proficiency acquisition matters. Finding a master blacksmith willing to teach Armorer (Expert) might be its own adventure. Gaining entry to the Cartographer's Guild might require proving your worth on a dangerous survey mission. Accessing forbidden texts to study Ritualist (Master) might risk sanity or legal consequences.

GMs should treat proficiency training as narrative opportunities, not bookkeeping. The character who spends downtime training with the retired weapons master learns not just techniques, but stories, connections, and complications. The character who joins the Baker's Guild gains not just the Baker proficiency, but a place in the community's social fabric.

## How to Read Proficiency Entries {#reading-proficiency-entries}

Proficiency entries in the following chapters follow a consistent format:

**Name and Tier**: The proficiency's name and required tier (N, T, E, or M).

**Description**: A 1-2 sentence overview of what the proficiency represents and what kind of expertise it embodies.

**Benefits**: The specific mechanical advantages the proficiency grants. This might include DC reductions, advantage on checks, unlocked actions, or special techniques.

**Synergies**: Related skills, tags, or other proficiencies that pair well with this one. For example, First Aid synergizes with the Medicine skill and conditions like Poisoned or Bleeding.

**Downtime Activities**: What the character can do with this proficiency during downtime—earning income, gathering resources, building reputation, or advancing personal projects.

**GM Usage**: Practical guidance for incorporating the proficiency into play. This includes when to call for checks, how to adjudicate partials, and how to make the proficiency feel meaningful at the table.

## Creating Custom Proficiencies {#creating-custom-proficiencies}

The proficiencies in chapters 13-17 are not exhaustive. Players and GMs are encouraged to create custom proficiencies that fit their characters and settings.

### Custom Proficiency Template {#custom-template}

Use this template as a starting point:

**[Proficiency Name] — [Tier]**

**Description**: [What this proficiency represents in 1-2 sentences]

**Benefits**:
- [Specific mechanical benefit 1]
- [Specific mechanical benefit 2]
- [Optional: specific mechanical benefit 3]

**Synergies**: [Related skills, tags, proficiencies, or conditions]

**Downtime Activities**: [What you can do with this during downtime]

**GM Usage**: [How to make this meaningful in play]

### Scaling Guidelines {#scaling-guidelines}

When designing custom proficiencies, consider these scaling principles:

**Novice**: Should grant advantage on simple checks OR reduce DC by 2 in straightforward situations. Should not fundamentally change what a character can attempt, but should make routine tasks more reliable.

**Trained**: Should grant advantage on a broader range of checks AND/OR reduce DC by 2-3 in their specialty. May unlock new techniques or downtime activities. Should make the character clearly more capable than untrained peers in specific contexts.

**Expert**: Should grant significant advantages (advantage + DC reduction, or DC -4, or unlocking advanced techniques). Should be broadly useful in their domain and potentially grant benefits to others (teaching, leadership, coordination bonuses).

**Master**: Should grant game-changing abilities or allow the character to attempt things that would otherwise be impossible. Should be rare and narratively significant. Consider whether this proficiency should exist in your campaign at all—masters represent the pinnacle of their craft and should feel legendary.

### Balance Considerations {#balance-considerations}

Good proficiencies are **situational, not universal**. A proficiency should shine in its domain but not overshadow characters with different specialties. First Aid should make you invaluable in medical crises, but it should not replace the need for other characters' skills in exploration, negotiation, or investigation.

Proficiencies should **interact cleanly with skills and tags**. They should enhance existing mechanics, not create parallel systems. When in doubt, grant advantage or reduce DCs rather than introducing new resolution mechanics.

Proficiencies should **require narrative justification**. Do not allow players to acquire proficiencies simply by spending downtime abstractly. The story of how they gained the proficiency matters as much as the mechanical benefits.

## Using This Section {#using-this-section}

The following chapters present proficiency sets organized by genre:
- **Chapter 13**: Cozy genre proficiencies (artisanal, domestic, community, nature)
- **Chapter 14**: Fantasy genre proficiencies (martial, magical, wilderness, social)
- **Chapter 15**: Horror/Mystery genre proficiencies (investigation, occult, survival, medical)
- **Chapter 16**: Modern genre proficiencies (professional, technical, tactical, social)
- **Chapter 17**: Sci-Fi genre proficiencies (starship, scientific, cybernetic, combat)

Each chapter provides 6-10 complete proficiencies with worked examples showing them in play. Use these as starting points, modify them to fit your setting, and create your own as needed. Proficiencies should feel earned, meaningful, and distinct—they are not just numbers on a character sheet, but reflections of dedication, training, and identity.
