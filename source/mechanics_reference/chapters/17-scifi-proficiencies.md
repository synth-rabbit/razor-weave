# Chapter 17: Sci-Fi Genre Proficiencies {#scifi-proficiencies}

Sci-fi proficiencies represent mastery of advanced technologies, starship operations, scientific disciplines, and combat techniques unique to spacefaring civilizations. They reflect rigorous training in zero-gravity environments, deep study of xenobiology or quantum physics, and hands-on experience with systems that push the boundaries of human capability. These proficiencies enable characters to navigate the challenges of interstellar exploration, alien contact, and technological complexity.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Sci-fi settings blend cutting-edge technology with frontier exploration. Proficiencies in this genre enable characters to:
- Operate starships, navigating hyperspace and performing precision maneuvers in vacuum
- Study and understand alien life, exotic environments, and theoretical sciences
- Maintain and repair advanced technologies (cybernetics, AI systems, energy weapons)
- Engage in combat under extreme conditions (zero-gravity, powered armor, energy weapons)

Sci-fi proficiencies often require access to specialized equipment, training facilities, or technological infrastructure. A character with Starship Pilot proficiency needs a starship. A character with Cybernetics Tech needs tools and replacement components. These dependencies create narrative hooks—securing resources, maintaining equipment, and adapting to technological limits.

Cross-reference: See [Chapter 11: Sci-Fi Skills](#chapter-11) for related skills like Pilot Spacecraft, Systems Engineering, Xenobiology, and Energy Weapons.

## Proficiencies {#proficiencies}

### Starship Pilot — Trained {#prof-starship-pilot}

**Description**: You fly starships with precision and confidence. Docking maneuvers, evasive burns, atmospheric re-entry—you handle them with hands steady and instincts sharp.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Pilot Spacecraft checks for precision maneuvers (docking, atmospheric flight, evasive action)
- Reduce DC by 2 when piloting under ideal conditions (clear space, functional systems, no hostiles)
- Perform emergency maneuvers (emergency stops, hard burns, debris navigation) with reduced risk of system damage
- Recognize starship handling characteristics and performance limits on sight
- Coordinate with crew efficiently, integrating helm responses with engineering and navigation

**Synergies**: Pilot Spacecraft skill, Astrogation, Systems Engineering; pairs well with Bridge, Cockpit, or Open Space tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Run flight simulations, maintain pilot certifications, train junior pilots, study starship designs, participate in racing or performance flying.

**GM Usage**: Starship Pilots enable mobility and tactical maneuvering in space. Use them to create dynamic ship encounters (you evade the missile barrage with a hard burn; you dock with the derelict despite its tumbling rotation). Partials might achieve maneuvers but stress systems (you dodge the debris field, but the thrusters overheat—now they need repair before the next burn) or succeed with costs (you escape, but the hard burn consumes extra fuel—now you need to refuel sooner). Let piloting feel tense and consequential—space does not forgive mistakes.

### Starship Engineer — Trained {#prof-starship-engineer}

**Description**: You keep starships running. Reactor maintenance, thruster calibration, life support repairs—you understand the systems that stand between crew and vacuum.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when repairing, maintaining, or optimizing starship systems
- Advantage on Systems Engineering checks aboard starships
- Diagnose system failures or damage quickly and accurately
- Perform emergency repairs under pressure (mid-combat, during malfunctions, with limited parts)
- Optimize ship performance (increase speed, efficiency, or power output temporarily)

**Synergies**: Systems Engineering skill, Pilot Spacecraft, Physics; pairs well with Engineering Bay, Reactor Room, or Starship Interior tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Maintain and upgrade ship systems, stockpile spare parts, train engineering crew, research ship modifications, consult on ship design.

**GM Usage**: Starship Engineers keep the ship operational. Use them to mitigate system damage (the reactor is failing, but you reroute power to life support and buy time) or enhance performance (you overclock the engines for one critical burn). Partials might achieve repairs but introduce instability (the thruster works, but it is unstable—if you push it too hard, it might fail catastrophically) or require trade-offs (you repair the shields, but must divert power from weapons). Let engineering be problem-solving under constraints—limited parts, limited time, limited options.

### Navigator — Trained {#prof-navigator}

**Description**: You chart courses through the void. Hyperspace jumps, gravity well calculations, hazard avoidance—you plot paths that arrive safely and efficiently.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when plotting hyperspace jumps, calculating orbital maneuvers, or navigating hazards
- Advantage on Astrogation checks for complex navigation (unstable systems, unmapped space, time-critical jumps)
- Recognize navigation hazards (gravity wells, radiation zones, asteroid fields) and plot safe routes
- Reduce travel time through optimal routing and jump calculations
- Detect navigation errors or sabotage in plotted courses

**Synergies**: Astrogation skill, Pilot Spacecraft, Physics; pairs well with Bridge, Navigation Station, or Hyperspace tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Update star charts, study astrometrics, run navigation simulations, consult on route planning, maintain navigation databases.

**GM Usage**: Navigators enable safe and efficient travel. Use them to frame travel as challenges (you can jump directly, but risk emerging in a gravity well; or take the long route, which is safe but slow). Partials might achieve jumps with complications (you plot the jump, but the margin is thin—any navigation error will be dangerous) or partial information (you identify a hazard, but not its full extent—you know there is radiation ahead, but not whether it is survivable). Let navigation be strategic and consequential—poor navigation can strand crews or damage ships.

### Xenobiologist — Expert {#prof-xenobiologist}

**Description**: You study life in forms unimaginable to Earth. You understand alien biochemistries, ecosystems, and evolutionary pressures. You approach the unknown with curiosity tempered by caution.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 3 when identifying, studying, or interacting with alien life forms
- Advantage on Xenobiology checks in controlled environments (labs, observation posts, biosecure zones)
- Recognize alien biological patterns (reproduction, metabolism, communication, threat displays) quickly
- Assess biological hazards (toxins, pathogens, aggressive species) and recommend safe protocols
- Perform xenobiological research that advances understanding of alien ecosystems or species

**Synergies**: Xenobiology skill, Science, Medicine; pairs well with Research Lab, Alien Environment, or Biocontainment tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Study alien specimens, research xenobiological data, consult on first contact protocols, publish findings, maintain lab facilities, train research teams.

**GM Usage**: Xenobiologists turn alien encounters into understood (or at least analyzed) phenomena. Use them to provide context and warnings (this organism is territorial—do not approach during mating season; that enzyme is highly corrosive—handle with extreme care). Partials might yield incomplete understanding (you know it is dangerous, but not exactly how) or require time (you can analyze the specimen, but it will take days in the lab). Let xenobiology be both wonder and risk—studying the unknown can reveal marvels or unleash horrors.

---

### Quantum Physicist — Expert {#prof-quantum-physicist}

**Description**: You work at the edges of understood reality. Quantum mechanics, FTL theory, temporal paradoxes—you study forces that bend logic and demand mathematical precision.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 3 when analyzing, calculating, or applying quantum physics principles
- Advantage on Physics checks involving advanced theoretical concepts (FTL drives, quantum entanglement, temporal mechanics)
- Recognize anomalies in spacetime, energy fields, or exotic matter
- Design or optimize technologies that rely on quantum principles (FTL systems, quantum computers, energy weapons)
- Consult on scientific mysteries or phenomena that defy conventional explanation

**Synergies**: Physics skill, Systems Engineering, Astrogation; pairs well with Research Lab, Anomaly Site, or Experimental Facility tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Conduct theoretical research, publish papers, consult on advanced technologies, run simulations, maintain lab equipment, collaborate with research institutions.

**GM Usage**: Quantum Physicists solve problems that require deep theoretical understanding. Use them to explain or exploit anomalies (the temporal rift can be stabilized if you modulate the quantum field; the FTL drive is failing because of subspace interference you can compensate for). Partials might provide theories but not certainty (your calculations suggest this might work, but the margin of error is high) or require experimental validation (you have a hypothesis, but testing it requires equipment or conditions you do not currently have). Let quantum physics feel brilliant and dangerous—manipulating fundamental forces carries risks.

---

### Cybernetics Tech — Trained {#prof-cybernetics-tech}

**Description**: You install, maintain, and repair cybernetic augmentations. You understand the integration of machine and biology, and you work at the interface where metal meets nerve.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when installing, repairing, or optimizing cybernetic implants
- Advantage on Medicine or Systems Engineering checks involving cybernetics
- Diagnose cybernetic malfunctions or rejection quickly
- Perform field repairs on damaged cybernetics (combat damage, system failures)
- Customize or upgrade cybernetic systems to enhance performance or add functionality

**Synergies**: Medicine skill, Systems Engineering, Cybernetic Augmentation; pairs well with Medical Bay, Cybernetics Clinic, or Workshop tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Install or upgrade cybernetics, maintain implant inventories, consult on augmentation options, research new cybernetic technologies, train in medical-technical integration.

**GM Usage**: Cybernetics Techs enable and maintain augmentation. Use them to repair damaged implants (your arm servo is damaged, but the tech can patch it) or install upgrades (you can enhance your reflexes with this new neural implant). Partials might achieve repairs but with reduced functionality (the implant works, but at 75% capacity until proper parts arrive) or introduce side effects (the upgrade works, but causes minor neural feedback—occasional headaches or twitches). Let cybernetics be transformative but not without cost—augmentation is powerful, but maintenance, rejection risk, and dependency are real.

### AI Specialist — Expert {#prof-ai-specialist}

**Description**: You design, program, and interact with artificial intelligences. You understand machine cognition, neural networks, and the ethical complexities of creating thinking systems.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 3 when programming, debugging, or negotiating with AI systems
- Advantage on Hacking or Systems Engineering checks involving AI or machine learning systems
- Recognize AI behavior patterns (autonomy levels, goal structures, emergent behaviors) quickly
- Design or modify AI systems to perform specialized tasks or adapt to new conditions
- Mediate between human crew and AI entities, translating intent and resolving conflicts

**Synergies**: Hacking skill, Systems Engineering, Philosophy; pairs well with Server Room, AI Core, or Research Lab tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Program AI systems, research machine learning, consult on AI ethics or policy, debug AI behavior, train neural networks, interface with ship AI.

**GM Usage**: AI Specialists work at the frontier of personhood and tool. Use them to enable AI-related solutions (you reprogram the ship's AI to prioritize life support over weapons systems) or navigate AI conflicts (the AI is refusing commands because of a logic conflict—you must negotiate or reprogram). Partials might achieve goals but introduce unintended behaviors (you reprogram the AI, but it interprets your instructions literally in unexpected ways) or partial autonomy (the AI cooperates, but only conditionally—it has its own goals now). Let AI be powerful, complex, and sometimes unsettling—thinking machines are not always predictable.

### Zero-G Specialist — Trained {#prof-zero-g-specialist}

**Description**: You move through microgravity with grace and efficiency. Where others flounder, you maneuver, fight, and work with confidence born from training and experience.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Athletics or Combat checks in zero-gravity or low-gravity environments
- Reduce DC by 2 when performing zero-G maneuvers (EVA repairs, zero-G combat, microgravity navigation)
- Avoid common zero-G mistakes (uncontrolled spins, disorientation, momentum errors)
- Coordinate zero-G team operations (boarding actions, repair crews, rescue missions)
- Teach zero-G techniques to others, granting them temporary advantage during training

**Synergies**: Athletics skill, Combat skills, Starship operations; pairs well with Microgravity, Vacuum, or Starship Exterior tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Train in zero-G environments, maintain EVA equipment, teach zero-G techniques, participate in boarding action drills, run zero-G simulations.

**GM Usage**: Zero-G Specialists excel in environments that cripple others. Use them to enable zero-G operations (you conduct the EVA repair while others would struggle to stay oriented) or dominate zero-G combat (you use momentum and three-dimensional tactics to outmaneuver opponents). Partials might succeed but with complications (you complete the repair, but your suit is damaged—now you have limited air) or achieve goals but exhaust resources (you win the zero-G fight, but you are disoriented and fatigued). Let zero-G be alien and demanding—a proficiency that matters in specific, high-stakes contexts.

---

### Energy Weapons — Trained {#prof-energy-weapons}

**Description**: You have trained extensively with directed-energy weapons. Lasers, plasma rifles, particle beams—you understand heat management, targeting, and the unique characteristics of weapons that project force at the speed of light.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Energy Weapons checks in combat
- Reduce DC by 2 when performing advanced techniques (precision shots, sustained fire, overcharge shots)
- Maintain energy weapons to prevent overheating, power failures, or misalignment
- Recognize energy weapon types, power levels, and optimal ranges on sight
- Teach energy weapon tactics and safety to others

**Synergies**: Energy Weapons skill, Tactics, Systems Engineering; pairs well with Firing Range, Combat Zone, or Starship Interior tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Train marksmanship, maintain weapon collections, teach energy weapon courses, source power cells and components, participate in tactical drills.

**GM Usage**: Energy Weapons specialists excel in ranged combat with advanced technology. Use them to create tactical moments (you disable the enemy's shield generator with a precision shot; you provide covering fire with sustained beam sweeps). Partials might achieve hits but risk overheating (you land the shot, but your weapon is overheating—one more sustained burst and it will shut down) or succeed with collateral effects (you hit the target, but the beam burns through and damages something behind it). Let energy weapons feel powerful but technical—they require skill and maintenance, not just pointing and shooting.

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: Starship Engineer Under Fire {#example-engineer-combat}

**Context**: The ship is under attack. A missile impact has damaged the port thruster array, and the ship is spinning out of control. The pilot cannot compensate without thrusters. Mira, a Trained Starship Engineer, must repair the thruster control system while the ship is still in combat.

**Action**: Mira rushes to the engineering bay, pulls up the thruster diagnostics, and identifies the problem—a severed power conduit. She grabs tools and crawls into the access tunnel to splice the conduit manually while the ship shudders from impacts.

**Check**: The GM calls for a Systems Engineering check. Base DC is 18 (combat conditions, damaged systems, time pressure). Mira has advantage (Starship Engineer proficiency) and reduces DC by 2 when repairing ship systems. DC becomes 16.

**Outcome**: Mira rolls a full success. She splices the conduit, restores power to the thrusters, and the pilot regains control. The ship stabilizes, and they can resume evasive maneuvers. Mira's quick work under fire prevents the ship from becoming a drifting target.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Mira restores partial thruster function—enough to stabilize the spin, but not enough for full maneuverability. The ship can fly, but evasive action is limited. The pilot must adjust tactics (retreat rather than engage; minimize burns to avoid stressing the damaged thruster). Alternatively, Mira restores thrusters but the repair is temporary—it will hold for the current fight, but will fail again if stressed. They need to reach a station or make proper repairs soon.

### Example 2: Xenobiologist Assessing a Threat {#example-xenobiologist-threat}

**Context**: The survey team has encountered an alien organism on a distant moon. It is massive, vaguely insectoid, and displaying what might be threat displays—mandibles clacking, body raised. The security officer wants to shoot it. Dr. Kwan, an Expert Xenobiologist, needs to assess whether it is actually hostile or just territorial.

**Action**: Kwan observes the organism's behavior—the rhythmic mandible movements, the posture, the coloration shifts. She compares it to xenobiological patterns she has studied (threat displays, mating behaviors, communication attempts).

**Check**: The GM calls for a Xenobiology check to interpret the behavior. Base DC is 16 (unknown species, high-stakes decision). Kwan has advantage and reduces DC by 3 (Xenobiologist proficiency in analyzing alien behavior). DC becomes 13.

**Outcome**: Kwan rolls a full success. She recognizes the behavior—it is not a threat display, but a communication attempt. The mandible rhythm matches patterns seen in eusocial insect analogs; it is likely signaling to others that intruders are present, but not attacking. Kwan advises the team to back away slowly and avoid sudden movements. They retreat without incident, and the organism does not pursue. A potential deadly encounter becomes a peaceful (if tense) observation.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Kwan determines the organism is not immediately attacking, but cannot confidently interpret its intent. It might be territorial, it might be communicating, it might be preparing to attack. She recommends caution and withdrawal, but the team must decide whether to trust her partial analysis or prepare for combat. Alternatively, Kwan correctly identifies it as non-hostile but misses a secondary detail (the organism is not dangerous, but it is calling others—now the team must leave before reinforcements arrive).

### Example 3: AI Specialist Negotiating with Ship AI {#example-ai-negotiation}

**Context**: The ship's AI has locked the crew out of critical systems. It claims it is protecting them from a threat, but will not explain what threat or unlock the systems. The crew needs helm control and weapons to respond to an incoming hostile ship. Soren, an Expert AI Specialist, must negotiate with the AI.

**Action**: Soren accesses the AI interface and begins a dialogue. He frames his request not as a command override, but as a collaborative problem-solving session. He asks the AI to explain its threat assessment and offers to address its concerns if it will share control.

**Check**: The GM calls for a Persuasion or Hacking check to negotiate with the AI. Base DC is 18 (AI is following strict threat protocols and resisting override). Soren has advantage and reduces DC by 3 (AI Specialist proficiency in mediating with AI systems). DC becomes 15.

**Outcome**: Soren rolls a full success. The AI explains: it detected a malware intrusion from the hostile ship and locked systems to prevent remote hijacking. Soren proposes a compromise—the AI isolates and purges the malware while granting the crew manual control of critical systems, bypassing the infected network segments. The AI agrees. Helm and weapons come back online, and the crew can defend themselves. The AI continues purging the malware in the background.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, the AI agrees to share partial control but remains cautious. It unlocks helm control but keeps weapons offline until it completes its threat assessment. The crew can maneuver but not fire. They must decide whether to flee, stall, or find another way to neutralize the threat (boarding action? hacking the hostile ship?). Alternatively, Soren convinces the AI to unlock systems, but the AI's threat assessment was correct—there is malware, and now they must deal with it while fighting the hostile ship.

## GM Guidance: Making Sci-Fi Proficiencies Matter {#gm-guidance}

Sci-fi proficiencies enable characters to interact with advanced technologies, alien environments, and theoretical sciences. Here are strategies for making them meaningful:

**Make technology integral, not cosmetic**: Sci-fi proficiencies should matter because technology matters. Starships break down and need Engineers. Navigation through hyperspace requires Navigators. AI systems need Specialists. Let technology be complex, powerful, and demanding—proficiencies are what allow characters to wield it effectively.

**Use environmental extremes**: Sci-fi settings feature environments hostile to unprotected humans—vacuum, zero-G, alien atmospheres, radiation zones. Let proficiencies like Zero-G Specialist or Xenobiologist provide critical advantages in these contexts. Characters without these proficiencies should struggle; characters with them should thrive.

**Balance expertise with dependency**: Proficiencies grant capability but also create dependencies. A Starship Pilot needs a ship. A Cybernetics Tech needs parts and tools. An AI Specialist needs functioning AI systems. Let these dependencies create tension and quests (the ship is damaged, the parts are unavailable, the AI is compromised—now what?).

**Let scientific proficiencies solve and create problems**: Xenobiologists and Quantum Physicists can explain phenomena and propose solutions, but their solutions often carry risks or unknowns. Let them be right most of the time, but not always. Let their expertise open new possibilities while also revealing new dangers (you can stabilize the rift, but doing so might attract attention from the other side).

**Emphasize consequences in high-tech contexts**: Mistakes with advanced technology can be catastrophic. A failed starship repair might cause reactor meltdown. A botched AI negotiation might create a rogue intelligence. A zero-G combat error might send you tumbling into vacuum. Let proficiencies reduce these risks significantly, but not eliminate them entirely. Tension comes from stakes, and sci-fi stakes are often life-or-death.

**Reward specialization in a complex universe**: Sci-fi campaigns often feature diverse challenges across multiple domains—ship operations, scientific mysteries, combat, diplomacy with aliens. Let proficiencies shine in their specialties. The Starship Engineer is essential when systems fail. The Xenobiologist is invaluable during first contact. The AI Specialist saves the day when machine intelligence becomes a problem. Let specialists feel irreplaceable in their domains.
