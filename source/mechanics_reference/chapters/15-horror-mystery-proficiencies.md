# Chapter 15: Horror/Mystery Genre Proficiencies {#horror-mystery-proficiencies}

Horror and mystery proficiencies reflect the specialized knowledge required to investigate the inexplicable, survive the dangerous, and confront the forbidden. They represent forensic rigor, occult scholarship, urban survival instincts, and the psychological fortitude to pursue truth into dark places. These proficiencies enable characters to solve mysteries, endure terrors, and emerge with answers—though not always unscathed.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Horror and mystery settings blend investigation with dread, revelation with cost. Proficiencies in this genre enable characters to:
- Analyze crime scenes, decode evidence, and reconstruct events with forensic precision
- Study occult lore, recognize supernatural signs, and perform protective rituals
- Survive hostile urban environments, evade pursuit, and navigate dangerous social networks
- Provide medical or psychological care under extreme conditions

These proficiencies often carry risks. Studying forbidden texts can erode sanity. Performing occult rituals can attract unwanted attention. Investigating too deeply can make you a target. Horror and mystery proficiencies grant power, but demand caution.

Cross-reference: See [Chapter 9: Horror/Mystery Skills](#chapter-09) for related skills like Research, Forensics, Composure, and Occult Lore.

## Proficiencies {#proficiencies}

### Forensics — Trained {#prof-forensics}

**Description**: You read crime scenes like texts. Blood spatter patterns, fiber evidence, tool marks—each tells a story if you know the grammar. You preserve, document, and extract meaning from chaos.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Investigation checks to analyze physical evidence at crime scenes
- Reduce DC by 2 when preserving or documenting evidence under proper conditions (lab, controlled environment)
- Recognize trace evidence (fibers, hairs, residues) and understand their significance
- Maintain chain of custody, ensuring evidence remains admissible or credible
- Estimate time of death, cause of injury, or sequence of events from physical signs

**Synergies**: Investigation skill, Medicine, Science; pairs well with Crime Scene, Laboratory, or Morgue tags. Interacts with Bleeding, Poisoned, or Dead conditions to extract information.

**Downtime Activities**: Process evidence in lab settings, consult on cold cases, train others in evidence collection, maintain forensic equipment, testify or report findings.

**GM Usage**: Forensics turns crime scenes into information sources. Use successful checks to reveal clues (the victim fought back; the killer wore gloves; this was staged to look like suicide). Partials might yield partial truths (you know the weapon type, but not the exact model) or require additional time or resources (the analysis works, but you need access to a better microscope). Let Forensics specialists feel competent and methodical, but also vulnerable—gathering evidence often means lingering in dangerous places.

### Archivist — Novice {#prof-archivist}

**Description**: You know how to navigate archives, catalogs, and collections. You understand classification systems, preservation methods, and the patience required to sift truth from dust.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when searching archives, libraries, or records for specific information
- Advantage on Research checks in organized collections (libraries, historical societies, databases)
- Recognize misfiled, altered, or missing records
- Preserve fragile documents and artifacts safely
- Compile research into usable summaries quickly

**Synergies**: Research skill, History, Librarian proficiency; pairs well with Library, Archive, or Museum tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Catalog collections, research obscure topics, authenticate documents, consult for scholars or investigators, maintain archives.

**GM Usage**: Archivists are information hunters. Use them to frame research as active challenges rather than passive lookups (you find the record, but it is in a restricted section; the information exists, but is cataloged under an obsolete system you must decode). Partials might yield fragments of truth (you find references to the ritual, but not the full instructions) or attract attention (the librarian notices your interest and asks uncomfortable questions). Let archives be atmospheric—dim reading rooms, crumbling ledgers, the sense that you are not alone among the stacks.

---

### Cryptographer — Trained {#prof-cryptographer}

**Description**: You decode secrets hidden in patterns. Ciphers, codes, symbolic languages—you unravel them with logic, intuition, and persistence. You also encode, ensuring your own secrets stay safe.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when decoding ciphers, encrypted messages, or symbolic texts
- Advantage on Investigation or Research checks involving coded information
- Recognize cipher types (substitution, transposition, symbolic) on sight
- Create simple to moderate ciphers to protect sensitive information
- Detect patterns in seemingly random data (repeated phrases, keyword hints, frequency analysis clues)

**Synergies**: Investigation skill, Lore (Forbidden), Mathematics; pairs well with Archive, Secret Society, or Hidden Message tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Decode intercepted messages, encode sensitive correspondence, study historical cipher systems, consult on cryptanalysis, develop new encoding methods.

**GM Usage**: Cryptography transforms inscriptions, letters, and documents into puzzles. Use successful checks to unlock hidden layers of meaning (the diary is in cipher; once decoded, it reveals the cult's meeting location). Partials might decode portions (you crack half the message, enough to know it is urgent but not what it says) or take longer than available time (you will break it, but it will take days, and the ritual is tonight). Let ciphers be clues and obstacles—the information exists, but you must work for it.

---

### Occult Scholar — Trained {#prof-occult-scholar}

**Description**: You have studied traditions most dismiss as superstition. You know which symbols ward, which summon, and which must never be drawn. Your knowledge is a tool, but also a burden.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when identifying occult symbols, rituals, or supernatural phenomena
- Advantage on Occult Lore checks to recall or research esoteric traditions
- Recognize magical or supernatural signs (wards, curses, summoning marks)
- Craft simple protective charms or wards against supernatural threats
- Understand the costs and dangers of occult practices, avoiding common traps

**Synergies**: Occult Lore skill, Research, Ritualist proficiency; pairs well with Forbidden Library, Occult Site, or Haunted tags. May counter or inflict Cursed, Hexed, or Haunted conditions.

**Downtime Activities**: Study forbidden texts, research supernatural phenomena, craft protective charms, consult on occult matters, maintain occult libraries or collections.

**GM Usage**: Occult Scholars walk the line between knowledge and danger. Use successful checks to provide context and warnings (this symbol summons, not binds; the ritual requires a blood price; the entity cannot be destroyed, only contained). Partials might yield correct but incomplete information (you know the ward works against spirits, but not which kind) or cost sanity (you find the answer, but the text describes things that disturb your sleep for weeks—gain a minor psychological condition). Let occult knowledge be powerful and risky.

---

### Medium — Expert {#prof-medium}

**Description**: You perceive the threshold between life and death. You sense presences others miss, hear whispers in the silence, and communicate with those who linger. This gift is not always gentle.

**Benefits**:
- Sense supernatural presences (ghosts, spirits, lingering emotional echoes) in a location
- Advantage on Occult Lore or Insight checks when attempting to communicate with or understand spirits
- Reduce DC by 3 when assisting wards, banishments, or exorcisms with spiritual insight
- Gain impressions or visions related to haunted locations or objects
- Recognize when a location or person is spiritually afflicted

**Synergies**: Occult Lore skill, Insight, Ritualist proficiency; pairs well with Haunted, Sacred Ground, or Graveyard tags. Interacts with Haunted, Possessed, or Cursed conditions.

**Downtime Activities**: Conduct seances, investigate hauntings, assist exorcisms, consult on spiritually troubled locations, meditate to process spiritual impressions.

**GM Usage**: Mediums are supernatural sensors. Use them to reveal hidden layers of setting (the room feels cold; you sense anger lingering here; a presence watches you). Partials might sense presence without understanding intent (something is here, but you cannot tell if it is hostile or benign) or misidentify type (you sense a ghost, but it is actually a demon mimicking one). Let Medium abilities be evocative but not omniscient—spirits do not always tell the truth, and some presences are too alien to communicate clearly. Mediums also attract attention; entities notice when they are noticed.

---

### Urban Survivalist — Trained {#prof-urban-survivalist}

**Description**: You thrive in the cracks of civilization. You know where to sleep safely, how to move unseen, and which alleys lead where. The city is hostile to the unwary, but you are neither.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Streetwise or Stealth checks in urban environments
- Reduce DC by 2 when finding shelter, food, or safe routes in cities
- Recognize urban dangers (gang territories, surveillance zones, unsafe structures) at a glance
- Navigate city infrastructure (sewers, rooftops, maintenance tunnels) safely
- Blend into urban crowds, reducing chance of detection or pursuit

**Synergies**: Streetwise skill, Stealth, Navigation; pairs well with Urban Ruins, Alleyway, or Undercity tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Map urban terrain, establish safe houses, cultivate street contacts, scavenge supplies, teach urban survival techniques.

**GM Usage**: Urban Survivalists turn hostile cities into navigable terrain. Use them to frame challenges as opportunities (the direct route is watched, but you know the rooftops; the safe house is compromised, but you know three alternatives). Partials might achieve safety but at a cost (you find shelter, but it is in gang territory—now you owe favors) or with delays (you reach the safe zone, but it takes twice as long, and pursuers gain ground). Let cities be characters—complex, dangerous, but knowable to those with expertise.

---

### Lockpicking — Novice {#prof-lockpicking}

**Description**: You understand the simple elegance of pins, tumblers, and tension. Locks are not barriers; they are invitations to those with patience and skill.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when picking simple to moderate locks
- Advantage on Thievery checks involving mechanical locks or latches
- Recognize lock types, quality, and potential traps on inspection
- Open locks quietly and without leaving obvious signs of tampering
- Improvise lockpicking tools from common objects if proper tools are unavailable

**Synergies**: Thievery skill, Stealth, Investigation; pairs well with Locked Door, Secure Vault, or Restricted Area tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Practice on various lock types, source or craft lockpicking tools, consult on security systems, teach lockpicking techniques (ethically or otherwise).

**GM Usage**: Lockpicking opens literal and metaphorical doors. Use it to provide alternative routes (you cannot bluff past the guard, but you can bypass the lock). Partials might open locks but trigger alarms, leave evidence of tampering, or take longer than safe (you open it, but someone heard the scratching and is coming to investigate). Let lockpicking be tense—time pressure, risk of discovery, the possibility of traps. Not all locks are mechanical; some require keys obtained through other means.

### Field Medic — Trained {#prof-field-medic}

**Description**: You stabilize trauma under pressure. Gunshot wounds, lacerations, chemical burns—you have seen it all and kept people breathing through it. You are not a surgeon, but you buy time for one to arrive.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Medicine checks to stabilize critical injuries or treat trauma
- Reduce DC by 2 when treating injuries in improvised or hostile conditions (battlefield, crime scene, safe house)
- Prevent conditions from worsening (Bleeding, Poisoned, Shock) with timely intervention
- Triage multiple casualties efficiently, prioritizing those most likely to survive with treatment
- Improvise medical supplies from available materials when proper equipment is lacking

**Synergies**: Medicine skill, First Aid, Science; pairs well with Field Hospital, Safe House, or Crisis Scene tags. Counters Bleeding, Shock, Poisoned, and Critical Injury conditions.

**Downtime Activities**: Stockpile medical supplies, train others in trauma care, work shifts in clinics or emergency rooms, consult on medical cases, maintain field kits.

**GM Usage**: Field Medics operate in chaos. Use them to create high-stakes triage scenarios (three wounded, limited supplies, who do you treat first?). Partials should save lives but introduce complications (you stabilize the patient, but infection risk is high without proper antibiotics; you stop the bleeding, but the patient is weakened and cannot move without help). Let Field Medics feel competent and stressed—they save lives, but the costs are visible and the resources finite.

---

### Psychiatrist — Expert {#prof-psychiatrist}

**Description**: You treat wounds that do not bleed. You listen, interpret, and guide those struggling with trauma, obsession, or dread. Your tools are words, insight, and patience.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 3 when diagnosing or treating psychological conditions (Traumatized, Obsessed, Paranoid, Phobic)
- Advantage on Insight checks to understand psychological states or motivations
- Provide therapeutic interventions that reduce severity or duration of mental conditions
- Recognize signs of manipulation, delusion, or psychological breakdown in others
- Offer counseling that grants temporary advantage on Composure checks to allies

**Synergies**: Insight skill, Medicine, Composure; pairs well with Safe Space, Therapy Session, or Confidential Setting tags. Interacts with Traumatized, Obsessed, Paranoid, Shaken, and similar psychological conditions.

**Downtime Activities**: Conduct therapy sessions, research psychological trauma, consult on mental health cases, provide support to traumatized allies, study psychological effects of supernatural exposure.

**GM Usage**: Psychiatrists address the toll that horror and mystery take on the mind. Use them to provide mechanical and narrative relief from psychological conditions (you can reduce Traumatized severity with therapy, but it takes time and safety). Partials might ease symptoms without resolving root causes (the nightmares lessen, but return under stress) or uncover deeper issues (treating the Obsession reveals it stems from a Curse, not psychology—now the problem is occult, not medical). Let Psychiatrists be valuable in campaigns that track sanity or psychological damage, and let them provide moments of care and recovery between horrors.

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: Forensics at a Murder Scene {#example-forensics-murder}

**Context**: A wealthy patron has been found dead in his locked study. The door was bolted from the inside, the windows sealed. The police suspect suicide, but the family believes otherwise and has hired the investigators. Elena, a Trained Forensics specialist, examines the scene.

**Action**: Elena photographs the body position, measures blood spatter, and examines the wound. She notes the angle of entry, the lack of powder burns, and the position of the gun in the victim's hand.

**Check**: The GM calls for an Investigation check to analyze the scene. Base DC is 16 (complex scene with contradictory evidence). Elena has advantage (Forensics proficiency) and reduces DC by 2 in proper conditions—she has brought her field kit and the scene is undisturbed, so DC becomes 14.

**Outcome**: Elena rolls a full success. She concludes: the wound angle is inconsistent with suicide; the gun placement is staged; and faint bruising on the victim's wrist suggests he was restrained. This was murder, disguised to look like suicide. The locked room is a puzzle, not proof of self-harm. Elena's findings redirect the investigation toward suspects with access to the study and knowledge of the victim's habits.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial success, Elena identifies that something is wrong (the wound angle is odd, the gun placement seems unnatural) but cannot conclusively rule out suicide. Her findings introduce doubt but not certainty. The investigation must continue, seeking additional evidence (witness statements, forensic analysis of the lock mechanism, toxicology reports).

### Example 2: Medium Investigating a Haunting {#example-medium-haunting}

**Context**: A family reports escalating disturbances in their home—cold spots, objects moving, whispers at night. Standard explanations (drafts, settling foundation, imagination) fail to account for the intensity and consistency. Marcus, an Expert Medium, is called to investigate.

**Action**: Marcus walks through the house, paying attention to his impressions. In the nursery, he feels overwhelming grief. In the basement, anger. He asks the family about the home's history.

**Check**: The GM calls for an Occult Lore check to sense and interpret the presence. Base DC is 14 (moderate haunting, emotional but not malicious). Marcus has advantage and reduces DC by 3 (Medium proficiency in spiritual perception). DC becomes 11.

**Outcome**: Marcus rolls a full success. He perceives the presence clearly—a young woman who died in childbirth in this house decades ago. She lingers, drawn by unfinished grief and a need to protect children. The disturbances are not malicious; they are attempts to communicate or soothe. Marcus conducts a small ritual with the family's permission, acknowledging the spirit and offering closure. The hauntings cease, replaced by an occasional sense of warmth—a protective presence, no longer agitated.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial success, Marcus senses the presence but misinterprets intent. He perceives grief but also anger, and cannot tell if the spirit is protective or hostile. He recommends caution and further investigation (what happened here? why is the spirit agitated?). Alternatively, he senses the spirit but the contact disturbs him—he gains a minor Shaken condition from the intensity of the grief he felt.

### Example 3: Urban Survivalist Evading Pursuit {#example-survivalist-evasion}

**Context**: Nia has uncovered evidence implicating a powerful crime family in a series of disappearances. She is now being hunted through the city by enforcers who want the evidence destroyed—and her silenced. Nia, a Trained Urban Survivalist, must evade pursuit and reach a safe house across town.

**Action**: Nia ducks into an alley, climbs a fire escape to the rooftops, and navigates across buildings to avoid street-level pursuers. She knows the city's layout and uses maintenance tunnels and shortcuts invisible to outsiders.

**Check**: The GM frames this as a chase with competing clocks: Escape Progress (6 segments, Nia) vs. Pursuit Progress (6 segments, enforcers). Nia rolls Streetwise or Stealth to evade. Base DC is 14 (urban pursuit, determined hunters). Nia has advantage (Urban Survivalist proficiency) and reduces DC by 2 in urban environments. DC becomes 12.

**Outcome**: Nia rolls a full success, advancing Escape Progress by 2 segments. The GM advances Pursuit Progress by 1 (the enforcers are organized but unfamiliar with rooftop routes). Over several rounds of evasion, Nia widens the gap and reaches the safe house undetected. She has bought time to analyze the evidence and plan her next move.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Nia advances Escape Progress by 1 segment but also advances Pursuit Progress by 1 (she evades temporarily but leaves signs of passage—disturbed laundry on a rooftop, a kicked-over trash can). The chase continues, tense and uncertain. Alternatively, she reaches the safe house but realizes she was followed partway—the enforcers do not know exactly where she is, but they know the neighborhood. The safe house is compromised in the long term.

## GM Guidance: Making Horror/Mystery Proficiencies Matter {#gm-guidance}

Horror and mystery proficiencies transform investigation and survival from abstract challenges into concrete, tense interactions. Here are strategies for making them meaningful:

**Make information valuable and costly**: Proficiencies like Forensics, Cryptographer, and Occult Scholar provide information, but information in horror and mystery should come with cost or risk. Decoding the cipher takes time you do not have. Analyzing the crime scene means lingering where the killer might return. Studying the forbidden text risks sanity. Let players choose when to pay these costs.

**Track psychological toll**: Horror and mystery wear on characters. Use conditions like Traumatized, Obsessed, Shaken, or Paranoid to reflect cumulative stress. Proficiencies like Psychiatrist and Medium offer relief, making them valuable beyond their primary functions. Let characters recover, but make recovery take time and safety.

**Let proficiencies reveal layers**: Mysteries should unfold through investigation. Each successful check should peel back a layer—Forensics reveals the murder weapon; Archivist uncovers the victim's secret identity; Cryptographer decodes the threatening letter. Build mysteries as onions, not locked boxes. Proficiencies are the knives that peel them.

**Use partials to complicate, not block**: Partial successes should advance the story with complications. You crack the cipher, but it implicates someone you trust. You sense the ghost, but now it knows you can perceive it. You evade pursuit, but abandon your supplies. Partials keep momentum while raising stakes.

**Respect expertise, but not omniscience**: Characters with proficiencies should feel competent in their domains, but not invulnerable. A Forensics expert can analyze evidence, but cannot magic evidence into existence. A Medium can sense spirits, but cannot control them. An Urban Survivalist can evade pursuit, but cannot outrun radios and organized search patterns indefinitely. Proficiencies grant advantage, not immunity to consequences.

**Make failure interesting**: Failed checks should not halt the investigation—they should redirect it or raise costs. You fail to decode the cipher in time, so the ritual happens; now you must stop it by other means. You fail to stabilize the victim; now someone died on your watch, and you carry that weight. Failure in horror and mystery should feel consequential, not frustrating.
