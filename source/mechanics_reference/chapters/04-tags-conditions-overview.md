# Tags and Conditions Overview {#tags-conditions-overview}

Tags and conditions add texture and consequence to the game world. Tags describe environmental and situational factors that shape scenes. Conditions represent character states that persist and modify capabilities. Together, they make fiction mechanically meaningful.

## What Tags Do {#what-tags-do}

Tags are descriptors applied to scenes, locations, objects, or situations. They modify how checks resolve by shifting DCs, granting advantage or disadvantage, or altering position and effect.

**Core Function**: Tags translate fiction into mechanical adjustments. A Dim room isn't just described as dark—the Dim tag grants advantage on Stealth checks and imposes disadvantage on ranged attacks beyond short range. The world's details shape what's possible.

**Common Applications**:
- **Environmental Tags**: Describe physical spaces (Dim, Elevated, Slick, Cramped)
- **Situational Tags**: Describe circumstances (Crowded, Alert, Hazardous, Obscuring)
- **Emotional Tags**: Describe social atmosphere (Tense, Festive, Solemn)

**GM Guidance**: Apply tags when they meaningfully affect actions. Don't tag everything—reserve tags for details that create mechanical texture. A room is just a room until the Dim lighting or Slick floor matters to what a character attempts.

### Tag Categories {#tag-categories}

**Environmental Tags** modify physical space:

- **Dim**: Advantage on Stealth, disadvantage on Perception and ranged attacks beyond short range. Duration: scene or until light sources introduced.
- **Elevated**: Advantage on ranged attacks from higher ground, disadvantage on melee attacks from lower ground. Duration: positional.
- **Slick**: Disadvantage on fast movement and Athletics checks. Duration: scene or until surface dries/clears.
- **Cramped**: Limits movement, may impose disadvantage on combat actions requiring space. Duration: locational.

**Situational Tags** modify circumstances:

- **Crowded**: +2 DC to move quickly, advantage on Stealth and blending. Duration: scene or until crowd disperses.
- **Alert**: NPCs actively searching, +2 DC to Stealth-based actions. Duration: scene or until threat passes.
- **Hazardous**: Partials or failures may inflict conditions (Poisoned, Bleeding, Exhausted). Duration: scene or until hazard removed.
- **Obscuring**: Advantage on contested checks where visibility matters, disadvantage on Perception. Duration: scene or until obscuration clears.

**Interaction Tags** modify how tags combine:

- **Fragile**: Structures or cover break easily. Partials may destroy cover or create new hazards. Duration: until broken.
- **Sacred Ground**: Advantage against undead or malevolent forces; may impose restrictions on certain actions. Duration: locational or until desecrated.

## How Tags Affect Checks {#tags-affect-checks}

Tags modify checks in three primary ways:

**1. Advantage or Disadvantage**: A Dim tag grants advantage on Stealth. A Slick tag imposes disadvantage on fast movement. When multiple tags apply, they may cancel or stack, depending on GM judgment.

**2. DC Adjustments**: Some tags shift DCs directly. An Alert tag might add +2 to Stealth DCs. A Helpful tag (good gossip in a cozy village) might reduce DC by 2 for gathering information.

**3. Position and Effect**: Tags shift risk and impact. A Hazardous tag might lower position (failure escalates to injury). A Sacred Ground tag might increase effect (rituals are more powerful here).

**Example (Fantasy)**: A character sneaks through a castle during a storm. The storm creates Obscuring (rain and wind) and Slick (wet stones) tags. The Obscuring tag grants advantage on Stealth, while Slick imposes disadvantage on Athletics if they need to climb. The GM rules that the advantage and disadvantage cancel for Stealth checks involving movement, but pure hiding benefits from Obscuring without penalty.

**Example (Horror)**: A detective searches a crime scene with a Dim Gaslight tag and Blood Scent tag (Hazardous). Dim grants advantage on moving unseen but imposes disadvantage on Perception checks to find small clues. The Blood Scent tag means a failed check might attract predators or scavengers, lowering position.

## What Conditions Do {#what-conditions-do}

Conditions represent persistent character states that modify capabilities. Unlike tags, which describe environments, conditions attach to characters and follow them between scenes until cleared.

**Core Function**: Conditions create mechanical consequences for narrative events. A character who falls into a trap becomes Restrained. A character who witnesses horror becomes Frightened. A character poisoned by a trap becomes Poisoned. These states persist and shape subsequent actions.

**Common Applications**:
- **Physical Conditions**: Poisoned, Bleeding, Exhausted, Restrained, Prone, Stunned
- **Mental Conditions**: Frightened, Distracted, Obsessed, Shaken
- **Magical Conditions**: Hexed, Cursed, Mana-Drained (genre-dependent)

**GM Guidance**: Apply conditions when fiction demands lasting impact. A scary moment might impose Frightened. A brutal fight might impose Exhausted. A trap's poison imposes Poisoned. Conditions aren't punishment—they're narrative and mechanical consequences that create texture and challenge.

### Common Conditions {#common-conditions}

**Poisoned**: Disadvantage on strenuous physical actions. Duration: until treated (Medicine DC 16) or rest. Clearing: Successful treatment, antidote, or full rest.

**Exhausted**: Disadvantage on complex actions requiring focus or stamina. Duration: rest. Clearing: Full rest with food and safety.

**Frightened**: Disadvantage on actions opposing the source of fear. Duration: scene or until source removed. Clearing: Distance from threat, calming support, or overcoming fear narratively.

**Restrained**: Cannot move freely; disadvantage on actions requiring mobility. Duration: until freed. Clearing: Break restraints (Athletics or Thievery check) or assistance.

**Bleeding**: Lose resources or effectiveness over time; risk escalation if untreated. Duration: until treated. Clearing: First aid (DC 14) or medical attention.

**Weakened**: Reduced effect on physical actions. Duration: rest or treatment. Clearing: Rest, medicine, or magical healing (genre-dependent).

## Condition Duration and Clearing {#duration-clearing}

Conditions persist based on their nature and narrative context:

**Scene Duration**: Lasts until the current scene ends. Frightened often clears when the threat passes. Distracted clears when focus returns.

**Clock Duration**: Clears when a clock advances or completes. A Hex Mark might be tied to a 3-segment clock, clearing when the clock fills.

**Rest Duration**: Clears after a full rest. Exhausted and Poisoned typically require rest to clear.

**Explicit Clear**: Requires specific action. Restrained requires breaking free. Cursed requires a ritual or dispelling.

**GM Guidance**: Match duration to narrative weight. Minor conditions (Distracted, Irritated) clear quickly. Major conditions (Cursed, Poisoned, Exhausted) require significant effort or time. Don't let conditions linger without purpose—they should drive decisions, not just accumulate.

**Example (Cozy)**: A character becomes Exhausted after organizing a multi-day festival. The condition imposes disadvantage on complex tasks. It clears after a full night's rest and a hearty meal. The condition reinforces the cost of their effort without punishing them long-term.

**Example (Modern)**: A character exposed to Tear Gas becomes Weakened (disadvantage on precise tasks). The condition lasts for the scene and clears after moving to fresh air and rinsing their eyes. Quick resolution reflects the temporary nature of the effect.

**Example (Sci-fi)**: A character suffers Radiation Burst exposure, becoming Weakened. The condition ties to a 3-segment clock. Each medical treatment advances the clock by 1. The condition clears when the clock fills, representing the time and care needed for recovery.

## Interaction Examples {#interaction-examples}

Tags and conditions interact to create layered mechanical situations:

### Example 1: Fantasy Combat in a Burning Building

**Tags**: Hazardous (fire), Fragile (burning beams), Obscuring (smoke)
**Conditions**: Character is Exhausted from a previous fight

**Situation**: The character attempts to rescue someone from the burning building.

- **Obscuring Tag**: Grants advantage on avoiding enemy notice but imposes disadvantage on Perception to find the victim.
- **Hazardous Tag**: Partials or failures risk adding Weakened or Bleeding conditions.
- **Fragile Tag**: Partials might collapse beams, changing the environment mid-scene.
- **Exhausted Condition**: Disadvantage on the strenuous Athletics check to navigate debris.

**Outcome - Partial**: The character finds the victim but a beam collapses, blocking the original exit. They must find a new route (new check) or break through the debris.

### Example 2: Horror Investigation in Fog

**Tags**: Dim Gaslight, Thick Fog (Obscuring + Slick), Blood Scent (Hazardous)
**Conditions**: Character is Frightened from a previous encounter

**Situation**: The character investigates a murder scene at night in heavy fog.

- **Dim + Obscuring Tags**: Advantage on Stealth, disadvantage on Perception.
- **Slick Tag**: Disadvantage on fast movement if pursued.
- **Hazardous Tag**: Blood Scent attracts predators on failed checks.
- **Frightened Condition**: Disadvantage on actions if predators appear.

**Outcome - Failure**: The character's nerves get the better of them. They misread a clue and alert something lurking in the fog. Now they must flee (with Slick imposing disadvantage on movement) or confront the threat (with Frightened imposing disadvantage).

### Example 3: Sci-fi EVA Repair

**Tags**: Hard Vacuum (Hazardous), Microgravity (Cramped)
**Conditions**: Character is Weakened from previous radiation exposure

**Situation**: The character must patch a hull breach before air runs out.

- **Hard Vacuum Tag**: Partials or failures risk escalating to life-threatening situations.
- **Microgravity Tag**: Disadvantage on fast movement; requires careful maneuvering.
- **Weakened Condition**: Reduced effect on physical actions; may take longer.

**Outcome - Success**: The character patches the breach cleanly despite the hostile conditions, demonstrating skill under pressure.

**Outcome - Partial**: The patch holds, but the character's limited mobility (Microgravity + Weakened) means they exhausted their spare materials. Future repairs will require different solutions.

## GM Usage Notes {#gm-usage-notes}

- Apply tags when they create meaningful mechanical texture. Not every room needs tags.
- Use conditions to reinforce narrative consequences. Frightened after horror, Exhausted after exertion, Poisoned after traps.
- Match condition duration to narrative weight. Minor conditions clear quickly; major conditions drive decisions.
- Tags and conditions interact to create layered situations. Let them combine naturally to reflect complex fiction.
- Keep the math simple: advantage/disadvantage or ±2 DC. Avoid stacking endless modifiers.
