# Chapter 08: Fantasy Genre Skills {#chapter-08}

Fantasy games celebrate heroism, magic, exploration, and the clash of steel. These skills turn dungeons into navigable challenges, courtly intrigue into narrative battlefields, and arcane mysteries into solvable puzzles. They are grounded in genre conventions where brave heroes face monsters, uncover ancient secrets, and shape the fate of kingdoms.

This chapter provides ready-to-use skills for fantasy games—whether high fantasy quests, gritty sword-and-sorcery, or magical realism. Use these skills when your game features adventurers, magic, wilderness survival, and combat.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Fantasy skills emphasize:

- **Combat Prowess**: Melee Combat, Archery, Tactics—skills for surviving and triumphing in battle.
- **Exploration Mastery**: Stealth, Perception, Athletics—skills for navigating dungeons, wilderness, and urban environments.
- **Social Influence**: Persuasion, Insight, Intimidation—skills for navigating courts, taverns, and tense negotiations.
- **Arcane and Divine Knowledge**: Arcana, Religion, Ritual—skills for understanding and wielding magic.
- **Wilderness Survival**: Survival, Animal Handling—skills for thriving beyond civilization.
- **Technical Expertise**: Medicine, Thievery—skills for healing wounds and bypassing obstacles.

Fantasy skills often interact with magic, monsters, and mythic stakes. A failed Stealth check might wake a dragon. A successful Persuasion check might avert a war. The world is larger than life, and the skills reflect that scope.

For proficiencies that enhance these skills, see Chapter 14 (Fantasy Proficiencies). For tags and conditions, see Chapter 18.
