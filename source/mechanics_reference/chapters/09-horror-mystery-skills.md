# Chapter 09: Horror/Mystery Genre Skills {#chapter-09}

Horror and mystery games thrive on investigation, tension, and the slow unraveling of terrible truths. These skills turn clues into narratives, fear into survival, and the unknown into something you can name—even if naming it does not make it less dangerous. They are grounded in psychological depth, forensic detail, and the creeping realization that some doors should not have been opened.

This chapter provides ready-to-use skills for horror and mystery games—whether gothic horror, cosmic dread, noir detective stories, or occult investigations. Use these skills when your game features hidden truths, fragile sanity, and the price of knowledge.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Horror and mystery skills emphasize:

- **Investigation**: Research, Forensics, Deduction—skills for uncovering hidden truths and connecting evidence.
- **Psychological Resilience**: Composure, Read Intent, Manipulation—skills for navigating fear, reading people, and maintaining control.
- **Occult Knowledge**: Occult Lore, Ritual Knowledge—skills for understanding and confronting supernatural forces.
- **Survival Under Pressure**: Urban Survival, Evasion, First Aid—skills for escaping danger and staying alive.
- **Social Interrogation**: Interview, Deceive—skills for extracting information and constructing false identities.

Horror and mystery skills often carry psychological costs. Learning the truth might mean nightmares. Confronting the occult might mean trauma. Failed checks do not just delay progress—they erode sanity, trust, and safety.

For proficiencies that enhance these skills, see Chapter 15 (Horror/Mystery Proficiencies). For tags and conditions, see Chapter 18.

## Using Horror/Mystery Skills {#using-horror-mystery-skills}

Horror and mystery skills reward careful investigation, psychological resilience, and strategic thinking. When using these skills:

- **Layer Clues**: Provide multiple clues through different skills—Research reveals history, Forensics reveals physical evidence, Deduction synthesizes both.
- **Use Psychological Costs**: Failed Composure or Occult Lore checks can inflict conditions (Shaken, Obsessed, Traumatized). Make knowledge dangerous.
- **Pace Revelations**: Use clocks to track investigation progress, pursuing threats, or eroding sanity.
- **Reward Preparation**: Players who gather evidence, plan rituals, and secure resources should gain advantages.

For proficiencies that enhance these skills, see Chapter 15 (Horror/Mystery Proficiencies). For tags and conditions, see Chapter 18 (Tags and Conditions Glossary).
