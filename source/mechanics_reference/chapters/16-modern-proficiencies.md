# Chapter 16: Modern Genre Proficiencies {#modern-proficiencies}

Modern proficiencies represent expertise in contemporary trades, professions, and tactical disciplines. They reflect years of formal education, professional certification, hands-on experience, and specialized training. These proficiencies enable characters to navigate complex systems—legal, technical, medical, social—with competence and authority.

## Genre Overview {#genre-overview}

Modern settings are defined by specialization and infrastructure. Proficiencies in this genre enable characters to:
- Practice licensed professions (law, medicine, accounting) with credibility and access
- Master technical systems (networks, vehicles, electronics) through training and certification
- Employ tactical skills (firearms, surveillance, negotiations) honed through professional or military experience
- Navigate social and institutional power structures with expertise and finesse

Modern proficiencies often come with credentials—degrees, licenses, certifications—that grant legal authority, professional access, or institutional trust. A character with the Doctor proficiency is not merely skilled in medicine; they are recognized as a physician, with all the responsibilities and privileges that entails.

Cross-reference: See [Chapter 10: Modern Skills](#chapter-10) for related skills like Law, Medicine, Hacking, and Firearms.

## Proficiencies {#proficiencies}

### Lawyer — Trained {#prof-lawyer}

**Description**: You navigate legal systems with precision. You draft contracts, argue cases, and interpret statutes. You understand that law is both shield and weapon.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when interpreting laws, drafting legal documents, or arguing legal points
- Advantage on Persuasion or Insight checks in legal contexts (courtrooms, negotiations, contract disputes)
- Recognize legal risks, loopholes, and precedents quickly
- Access legal databases, court records, and restricted legal resources
- Gain professional credibility in legal settings, influencing judges, clerks, and law enforcement

**Synergies**: Law skill, Persuasion, Research; pairs well with Courtroom, Law Office, or Contract Negotiation tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Practice law (represent clients, draft documents, consult on cases), research case law, maintain bar certification, cultivate professional networks, testify as expert witness.

**GM Usage**: Lawyers shape outcomes through procedure and argument. Use them to turn legal obstacles into challenges rather than blocks (you cannot enter without a warrant, but you can obtain one with the right motion). Partials might win points but not cases (your argument is sound, but the judge defers ruling until more evidence is presented) or achieve legal victories with social costs (you win the case, but make an enemy of the opposing counsel). Let legal proficiency feel like chess—strategic, consequential, bound by rules that can be bent but not broken.

### Doctor — Expert {#prof-doctor}

**Description**: You diagnose, treat, and heal with the authority of medical training. You read test results, prescribe interventions, and make life-or-death calls with the confidence earned through years of practice.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 3 when diagnosing illnesses, treating injuries, or performing medical procedures
- Advantage on Medicine checks in clinical or well-equipped settings (hospitals, clinics, ambulances)
- Perform complex medical interventions (surgery, advanced trauma care, disease treatment) that others cannot attempt
- Prescribe medications and treatments with legal and professional authority
- Recognize medical malpractice, misdiagnosis, or unusual symptoms on sight

**Synergies**: Medicine skill, Science, Field Medic proficiency; pairs well with Hospital, Clinic, or Emergency Room tags. Counters Bleeding, Poisoned, Diseased, Shock, and Critical Injury conditions.

**Downtime Activities**: Maintain medical practice, perform surgeries or procedures, research medical conditions, consult on difficult cases, train medical students, maintain licensing and certifications.

**GM Usage**: Doctors operate at the expert tier of medical care. Use them to solve medical crises that would overwhelm lesser-trained characters (stabilizing multiple trauma patients, diagnosing rare diseases, performing emergency surgery). Partials should achieve medical goals but introduce complications (the surgery succeeds, but recovery will be long and requires rare medications; you diagnose the illness, but treatment requires equipment not available here). Let Doctors feel authoritative and burdened—they save lives, but the responsibility and the failures weigh heavily.

### Accountant — Trained {#prof-accountant}

**Description**: You track money through mazes of ledgers, invoices, and tax codes. You find discrepancies others miss and understand that numbers tell stories if you know the language.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when analyzing financial records, detecting fraud, or preparing financial documents
- Advantage on Investigation or Research checks involving financial data, audits, or economic patterns
- Recognize accounting irregularities (embezzlement, money laundering, tax evasion) quickly
- Navigate tax codes, regulatory requirements, and financial compliance frameworks
- Access financial databases and institutional records with professional credibility

**Synergies**: Finance skill, Law, Research; pairs well with Office, Audit Room, or Financial District tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Manage finances, conduct audits, prepare tax filings, consult on financial crimes, research economic trends, maintain professional certifications.

**GM Usage**: Accountants turn financial trails into narratives. Use them to uncover hidden connections (the shell company funnels money to the crime syndicate; the charity is a front for money laundering). Partials might identify irregularities but not their full scope (you know something is wrong with the books, but need more records to prove it) or attract attention from those being investigated (your audit triggers a threatening visit from someone with something to hide). Let accounting be investigative work—patient, meticulous, and revealing.

---

### Network Admin — Trained {#prof-network-admin}

**Description**: You understand the architecture of interconnected systems. You configure, secure, and troubleshoot networks that keep institutions running. You see data flows as rivers—and you know where the dams are.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when configuring, securing, or troubleshooting computer networks
- Advantage on Hacking checks to penetrate, defend, or analyze network security
- Recognize network vulnerabilities, intrusions, or unusual traffic patterns quickly
- Map network topologies and identify critical nodes or access points
- Maintain and optimize network infrastructure, preventing or mitigating outages

**Synergies**: Hacking skill, Engineering, Security Systems; pairs well with Server Room, Data Center, or Corporate Network tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Maintain network infrastructure, respond to security incidents, configure new systems, consult on cybersecurity, research exploits or patches, train junior admins.

**GM Usage**: Network Admins are digital gatekeepers. Use them to enable or prevent hacking attempts (the network is hardened, but you know where the backup server is; the firewall blocks you, but you can reconfigure it from the inside). Partials might gain access but trigger alerts (you are in, but the security team is responding), or harden systems but leave gaps (you patch most vulnerabilities, but miss one—and it is exploited later). Let network administration be both shield and key.

---

### Mechanic — Trained {#prof-mechanic}

**Description**: You diagnose and repair machines with confidence. Engines, transmissions, electrical systems—you understand them not as mysteries, but as solvable problems.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when diagnosing or repairing vehicles, machinery, or mechanical systems
- Advantage on Engineering checks involving automotive or mechanical repair
- Perform field repairs under pressure (mid-chase, hostile environments, limited tools)
- Identify sabotage, mechanical failure, or quality issues by inspection
- Improvise repairs using available materials when proper parts are unavailable

**Synergies**: Engineering skill, Driving, Technical knowledge; pairs well with Garage, Workshop, or Roadside tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Repair and maintain vehicles, customize or upgrade machines, source parts, consult on mechanical issues, teach repair skills, operate a repair shop.

**GM Usage**: Mechanics keep the party mobile. Use them to mitigate vehicle breakdowns or sabotage (the car is dead, but you can bypass the kill switch and get it running). Partials might achieve temporary fixes that hold for a scene but fail under stress (the engine runs, but overheats if pushed too hard) or require improvised parts that reduce performance (you repair the transmission, but it is sluggish until you get proper parts). Let Mechanics feel essential when machines matter.

### Electrician — Novice {#prof-electrician}

**Description**: You work with the invisible current that powers modern life. You wire circuits, troubleshoot outages, and respect the fact that electricity does not forgive mistakes.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when installing, repairing, or troubleshooting electrical systems
- Advantage on Engineering checks involving electrical wiring, power distribution, or safety
- Recognize electrical hazards (overloaded circuits, faulty wiring, live wires) on sight
- Restore power to buildings or systems after outages or sabotage
- Safely disable electrical security systems or traps

**Synergies**: Engineering skill, Technical knowledge, Security Systems; pairs well with Building Interior, Power Plant, or Construction Site tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Perform electrical work, maintain power systems, consult on installations, source electrical components, teach basic electrical safety.

**GM Usage**: Electricians manipulate infrastructure. Use them to restore critical systems (the building is dark, but you can reroute power to the elevator) or disable obstacles (the security grid can be bypassed if you cut the right breaker). Partials might succeed but introduce risks (you restore power, but the system is unstable—it might blow a fuse under load) or take longer than safe (you can disable the alarm, but it will take ten minutes, and the guards patrol every five). Let electrical work feel technical and consequential.

---

### Firearms Expert — Trained {#prof-firearms-expert}

**Description**: You have trained extensively with firearms. You know weapon handling, maintenance, marksmanship, and tactics. You treat firearms as tools that demand respect and discipline.

**Benefits**:
- Advantage on Firearms checks in combat or tactical situations
- Reduce DC by 2 when performing advanced techniques (precision shots, suppressive fire, weapon manipulation under stress)
- Maintain firearms to prevent malfunctions and extend service life
- Recognize firearm types, calibers, and modifications on sight
- Teach firearm safety and marksmanship to others

**Synergies**: Firearms skill, Tactics, Combat training; pairs well with Firing Range, Urban Combat, or Tactical Scenario tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Train marksmanship, maintain weapon collections, teach firearms courses, participate in competitions, source ammunition and parts, consult on tactical scenarios.

**GM Usage**: Firearms Experts excel in ranged combat. Use them to create tactical advantages (you cover the retreat with suppressive fire; you disable the vehicle with a precision shot to the engine block). Partials might achieve tactical goals but create new problems (you suppress the enemy, but run low on ammo) or miss secondary effects (you hit the target, but the gunshot alerts reinforcements). Let firearms expertise feel professional and dangerous—controlled, but never safe.

---

### Surveillance Tech — Trained {#prof-surveillance-tech}

**Description**: You install, operate, and defeat surveillance systems. Cameras, bugs, trackers—you understand them as tools and targets.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when installing, operating, or defeating surveillance equipment
- Advantage on Investigation or Hacking checks involving surveillance systems (CCTV, bugs, digital tracking)
- Detect hidden surveillance devices (cameras, microphones, GPS trackers) through inspection or electronic sweeps
- Monitor surveillance feeds efficiently, spotting details others miss
- Disable or loop surveillance systems without leaving obvious traces

**Synergies**: Hacking skill, Electronics, Security Systems; pairs well with Security Room, Under Surveillance, or High-Security Area tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Install or maintain surveillance systems, conduct counter-surveillance sweeps, monitor feeds, consult on security, source surveillance equipment.

**GM Usage**: Surveillance Tech specialists control information flow. Use them to enable intelligence gathering (you tap the office phone; now you hear their plans) or counter enemy intelligence (you sweep the safe house and find three bugs). Partials might achieve partial coverage (you install the camera, but it only covers half the room) or introduce risks (you disable the surveillance, but the security team notices the blind spot and investigates). Let surveillance be a chess game of watchers and watched.

---

### PR Specialist — Novice {#prof-pr-specialist}

**Description**: You manage reputations and narratives. You know how to frame stories, handle crises, and shape public perception. You understand that image is often more powerful than truth.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when managing public relations, crafting messaging, or handling media
- Advantage on Persuasion or Networking checks in media or public-facing contexts
- Mitigate reputational damage from scandals or controversies through strategic communication
- Recognize spin, manipulation, and media narratives quickly
- Cultivate media contacts and influence coverage of events

**Synergies**: Networking skill, Persuasion, Social Media; pairs well with Press Conference, Media Event, or Public Statement tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Manage public image, craft press releases, handle media inquiries, consult on communications strategy, monitor public sentiment, build media relationships.

**GM Usage**: PR Specialists shape narratives. Use them to mitigate social consequences (the scandal breaks, but your statement reframes it as a misunderstanding) or amplify successes (the charity event becomes front-page news, boosting your organization's reputation). Partials might reduce damage but not eliminate it (the story still runs, but your side is heard) or succeed with unintended side effects (your statement goes viral, attracting attention you did not want). Let PR feel like narrative combat—words as weapons and shields.

---

### Negotiator — Trained {#prof-negotiator}

**Description**: You broker deals under pressure. Hostage situations, labor disputes, business mergers—you find terms both sides can live with, even when emotions run high.

**Benefits**:
- Reduce DC by 2 when negotiating high-stakes agreements, de-escalating conflicts, or mediating disputes
- Advantage on Persuasion or Insight checks in negotiation contexts
- Recognize negotiation tactics (bluffs, anchoring, good cop/bad cop) and counter them effectively
- Maintain composure and credibility even in tense or hostile negotiations
- Facilitate compromise and consensus-building among opposed parties

**Synergies**: Persuasion skill, Insight, Diplomat proficiency; pairs well with Neutral Ground, Negotiation Table, or Crisis Scene tags.

**Downtime Activities**: Mediate disputes, negotiate contracts or agreements, train in negotiation techniques, consult on conflict resolution, build networks with mediators and arbitrators.

**GM Usage**: Negotiators turn conflict into conversation. Use them to create alternatives to violence (the standoff can end peacefully if you broker terms acceptable to both sides). Partials might achieve temporary agreements (you negotiate a ceasefire, but it is fragile and might collapse) or get one side on board but not the other (the union accepts your terms, but management balks). Let negotiation be dynamic and risky—words matter, but so do body language, timing, and trust.

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: Doctor Under Pressure {#example-doctor-pressure}

**Context**: A car bombing has left three victims critically injured. The nearest hospital is twenty minutes away, and they might not survive the trip. Dr. Khalil, an Expert Doctor, must stabilize all three in a makeshift field clinic.

**Action**: Khalil triages quickly—one victim has internal bleeding (most critical), one has severe burns (stable for now), and one has a collapsed lung (critical but manageable). He focuses on the internal bleeding first, then the collapsed lung, then the burns.

**Check**: The GM frames this as a triage challenge with three injury clocks. Khalil has advantage and reduces DC by 3 in clinical settings—the makeshift clinic has some equipment (IV supplies, basic surgical tools), so the GM grants the reduction. Base DC is 18 (critical trauma, limited resources). With reduction, DC becomes 15.

**Outcome**: Khalil rolls a full success on the internal bleeding patient. He stabilizes the bleeding with a temporary clotting agent and IV fluids. He moves to the collapsed lung patient and successfully inserts a chest tube, re-inflating the lung. By the time the ambulance arrives, all three patients are stabilized enough to survive transport. Khalil is exhausted but has saved three lives.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Khalil stabilizes the internal bleeding and collapsed lung patients, but the burns patient develops complications (Shock condition from pain and fluid loss). The patient survives, but recovery will be longer and more difficult. Alternatively, Khalil stabilizes all three but exhausts his medical supplies—if another emergency arises before resupply, he has limited options.

### Example 2: Network Admin Infiltrating a Server {#example-network-infiltration}

**Context**: The team needs to access a corporation's internal email server to gather evidence of illegal activity. The server is behind a hardened firewall and monitored by security staff. Ravi, a Trained Network Admin, must penetrate the network without triggering alarms.

**Action**: Ravi maps the network topology from external reconnaissance, identifies a less-monitored access point (a contractor VPN), and uses valid credentials obtained from social engineering to log in. From there, he navigates to the email server.

**Check**: The GM calls for a Hacking check to penetrate the network. Base DC is 16 (hardened corporate network, active monitoring). Ravi has advantage (Network Admin proficiency) and reduces DC by 2 due to his understanding of network architecture. DC becomes 14.

**Outcome**: Ravi rolls a full success. He accesses the email server, extracts the needed emails, and logs out cleanly. The security logs show only routine contractor activity. The evidence is obtained without alerting the corporation.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Ravi accesses the server and extracts the emails, but his presence triggers an automated alert. The security team investigates but does not immediately identify him as an intruder (they assume it is a misconfigured system). Ravi has a window—maybe hours, maybe a day—before they trace the intrusion. The team must act quickly on the evidence before the corporation realizes it has been breached.

### Example 3: Negotiator De-escalating a Standoff {#example-negotiator-standoff}

**Context**: A desperate father has taken his daughter's teacher hostage in a school, demanding answers about his daughter's expulsion. Police have surrounded the building, and tensions are escalating. Sara, a Trained Negotiator, is called in to de-escalate.

**Action**: Sara establishes communication with the father, listening to his grievances without judgment. She acknowledges his pain, validates his concern for his daughter, and begins exploring what he actually needs (a meeting with the principal, a review of the expulsion decision) rather than what he is demanding (immediate reinstatement).

**Check**: The GM calls for a Persuasion check to de-escalate. Base DC is 16 (high-stakes, emotionally charged, armed subject). Sara has advantage (Negotiator proficiency) and reduces DC by 2 in negotiation contexts. DC becomes 14.

**Outcome**: Sara rolls a full success. Over two hours of careful conversation, she builds trust. The father agrees to release the teacher unharmed in exchange for a guaranteed meeting with the school board to review the expulsion. The standoff ends peacefully. The father is arrested, but no one is hurt, and Sara's intervention prevents a tragedy.

**Partial Alternative**: On a partial, Sara partially de-escalates. The father agrees to release the teacher, but refuses to surrender himself—he barricades inside the classroom, demanding the meeting happen immediately. Sara has reduced immediate danger, but the standoff continues. Alternatively, the father releases the hostage but is deeply distrustful—Sara must continue negotiating carefully, or the father might harm himself.

## GM Guidance: Making Modern Proficiencies Matter {#gm-guidance}

Modern proficiencies reflect professional expertise in specialized, credential-driven fields. Here are strategies for making them meaningful:

**Respect credentials and access**: Modern proficiencies often come with legal authority or institutional access. A Doctor can prescribe medications and perform surgery legally. A Lawyer can represent clients in court. A Network Admin has access to server rooms and systems others cannot enter. Let these credentials open doors and grant authority that untrained characters lack.

**Use professional networks**: Characters with modern proficiencies belong to professional communities (legal associations, medical networks, industry groups). Let these networks provide resources, information, and support—but also obligations and scrutiny. The Lawyer knows other lawyers who can help, but also has a professional reputation to maintain. The Doctor has access to medical databases, but leaving a trail might attract attention.

**Let expertise solve problems others cannot**: Proficiencies should grant capabilities unavailable to generalists. A Mechanic can repair a sabotaged engine mid-chase. A Network Admin can bypass corporate firewalls. An Accountant can trace money through shell companies. These are not abstract bonuses—they are concrete abilities that change what the party can attempt.

**Introduce resource and time constraints**: Modern proficiencies often require equipment, databases, or time. A Doctor needs medical supplies. A Lawyer needs legal databases and time to research. A Mechanic needs tools and parts. Let these requirements create challenges and trade-offs (you can repair the car, but it will take hours—do we have that time? You can access the database, but it requires being physically at the law library—can we get there?).

**Balance competence with consequences**: Characters with modern proficiencies should feel expert, but not invulnerable. A Firearms Expert can win gunfights, but bullets are still lethal. A Negotiator can de-escalate crises, but some people cannot be reasoned with. A Doctor can save lives, but medicine has limits. Let proficiencies grant advantage and capability while preserving tension and risk.
