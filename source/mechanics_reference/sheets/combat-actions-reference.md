## Ending Combat

**Combat ends when**:
- All enemies defeated, fled, or surrendered
- PCs retreat or escape
- Objectives achieved (rescue, retrieve item, etc.)
- Narrative resolution (negotiation, third party intervenes)

**Don't fight to zero HP** - allow surrender, retreat, or dramatic conclusions
