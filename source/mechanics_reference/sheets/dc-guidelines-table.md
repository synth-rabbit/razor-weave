# DC Guidelines Table

Comprehensive reference for setting Difficulty Classes.

---

## Core DC Scale

| DC | Difficulty | When to Use | Success Rate* |
|----|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **6** | **Easy** | Routine task, favorable conditions, trained | ~95% |
| **8** | **Moderate** | Standard challenge for competent character | ~85% |
| **10** | **Challenging** | Difficult but achievable, requires skill | ~70% |
| **12** | **Hard** | Requires expertise, unfavorable conditions | ~50% |
| **14** | **Very Hard** | Exceptional skill needed, serious obstacles | ~30% |
| **16** | **Extreme** | Near impossible for most, only masters succeed | ~15% |
| **18+** | **Legendary** | Should only be possible for tier 4 characters | <5% |

*Success rate assumes +2 skill bonus (competent character)

## Setting DCs by Situation

### By Character Capability

**Novice (Tier 1, +0 to +2)**:
- Routine: DC 6
- Challenge: DC 8-10
- Hard limit: DC 12

**Competent (Tier 2, +2 to +3)**:
- Routine: DC 8
- Challenge: DC 10-12
- Hard limit: DC 14

**Expert (Tier 3, +3 to +4)**:
- Routine: DC 10
- Challenge: DC 12-14
- Hard limit: DC 16

**Master (Tier 4, +4 to +5)**:
- Routine: DC 12
- Challenge: DC 14-16
- Hard limit: DC 18+

---

## Contextual Modifiers

### Increase DC (+2 to +4)

**+2 when**:
- Time pressure or rushed
- Poor tools or missing equipment
- Distractions or interruptions
- Unfamiliar environment

**+4 when**:
- Active opposition
- Extreme conditions (storm, darkness, etc.)
- Severe injury or exhaustion
- Critical stakes create pressure

---

### Decrease DC (-2 to -4)

**-2 when**:
- Ample time and preparation
- Perfect tools and resources
- Ideal conditions
- Expert assistance available

**-4 when**:
- Previous practice or rehearsal
- Custom tools designed for task
- Multiple experts assisting
- Perfect circumstances align

---

## Advantage/Disadvantage Instead

**Grant Advantage rather than lowering DC when**:
- Situational benefit that doesn't change task difficulty
- Clever approach or good planning
- Ally assistance
- Using relevant proficiency creatively

**Impose Disadvantage rather than raising DC when**:
- Situational hindrance
- Improvising or lacking preparation
- Injured or impaired
- Environmental distraction

## Genre-Specific DCs

### Cozy Genre

**Lower stakes = lower base DCs**:
- Most tasks: DC 6-8
- Challenges: DC 8-10
- Significant challenges: DC 10-12
- Rarely above DC 12

**Focus**: Success with cost, not outright failure

---

### Fantasy Genre

**Traditional scaling**:
- Use standard DC table
- Magic may modify DCs
- Legendary tasks common at high tier

---

### Horror/Mystery Genre

**Information gathering easier, action harder**:
- Clues and investigation: DC 6-8
- Physical challenges: DC 10-12
- Escape/survival: DC 12-14

**Focus**: Players should find information; acting on it is dangerous

---

### Modern Genre

**Realistic difficulty**:
- Use standard DC table
- Technology can lower DCs
- Firearms and modern threats are deadly

---

### Sci-Fi Genre

**Technology shifts baseline**:
- Basic tasks easier with tech: -2 DC
- Advanced tasks possible
- Alien tech raises DCs significantly

---

## Competitive Checks

### PC vs PC
**Both roll**, higher result wins
**Tie**: Status quo or both partially succeed

### PC vs NPC
**PC rolls vs NPC's skill as DC**:
- NPC passive skill: 7 + skill bonus
- NPC active opposition: NPC rolls, becomes DC

**Example**:
- Stealth vs Perception
- Deception vs Insight
- Sleight of Hand vs Perception

---

## Group Checks

### Everyone Must Succeed
**Each PC rolls individually**:
- All must meet DC
- Used when everyone faces same challenge
- Example: Climbing a wall

### Majority Must Succeed
**Half or more must succeed**:
- Group succeeds if majority does
- Used for team efforts
- Example: Sneaking past guard

### Assist Checks
**One PC rolls with advantage**:
- Others provide help
- Only one check made
- Used when one person leads

---

## Automatic Success/Failure

### Automatic Success
**Don't roll when**:
- Task is trivial for character's skill level
- No time pressure
- Failure wouldn't be interesting
- DC would be 4 or lower

**Example**: Expert climber with rope and time doesn't roll for easy climb

### Automatic Failure
**Don't roll when**:
- Task is impossible
- No chance even with perfect roll
- Success wouldn't be interesting

**Example**: Can't persuade someone to commit suicide

---

## Success with Consequences (7-9 Result)

### Common Consequences

**Cost**:
- Use resource (HP, item, time, favor)
- Expend limited ability
- Pay price in some way

**Complication**:
- New problem arises
- Situation becomes more complex
- Future challenges created

**Compromise**:
- Get less than wanted
- Partial information
- Incomplete solution

**Attention**:
- Success but noticed
- Alert enemies
- Lose stealth/surprise

**Risk**:
- Exposed to danger
- Vulnerable position
- Create opening for enemy

---

## Interpreting Results

### By Roll Total

**10+**: Full success, no downside
- Achieve goal completely
- No complications
- May get bonus on exceptional roll (13+)

**7-9**: Success with cost
- Achieve goal but...
- Choose from consequence list
- GM offers hard bargain

**6 or less**: Failure but...
- Story moves forward
- Learn something
- New opportunity emerges
- Not dead end

---

## Quick DC Decision Tree

**Step 1**: What tier are the PCs?
- Tier 1: Base DC 8-10
- Tier 2: Base DC 10-12
- Tier 3: Base DC 12-14
- Tier 4: Base DC 14-16

**Step 2**: How difficult for that tier?
- Easy: -2
- Standard: +0
- Hard: +2
- Very hard: +4

**Step 3**: Situational modifiers?
- Good conditions: -2
- Bad conditions: +2
- Active opposition: +2 to +4

**Step 4**: Result
- Final DC set
- Roll and resolve

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Don't
- Set DC too high for tier
- Require roll for trivial task
- Use DC when opposed check better
- Forget about advantage/disadvantage
- Make critical path impossible

### Do
- Match DC to party tier
- Use auto-success for mundane
- Offer multiple paths to goal
- Consider advantage over DC changes
- Make failure interesting

---

## DC by Frequency

### Often (Every Session)
- DC 8: Standard challenges
- DC 10: Meaningful challenges
- Players should succeed most of time

### Sometimes (Every 2-3 Sessions)
- DC 12: Hard challenges
- DC 14: Very hard challenges
- Should feel significant when overcome

### Rarely (Once per arc)
- DC 16: Extreme challenges
- DC 18: Legendary challenges
- Epic moments, major milestones
