    ↓

- Actions → When triggered
- Checks → On success/failure
    ↓
What happens when full?

## Using Clocks in Play

### Reveal to Players?

**Yes (transparent)**: When...
- Progress clocks (their goals)
- Creating urgency
- Clear time pressure
- Tension is the point

**No (hidden)**: When...
- Threat clocks (surprises)
- Atmosphere over mechanics
- Metagaming concern
- Reveal at dramatic moment

**Partial (hints)**: When...
- Signs of progress
- Clues to threat
- Mystery unfolding
- Building tension

---

### Advancing Clocks

**During Session**:
- Mark immediately when triggered
- Announce if transparent
- Describe what it means fictionally

**Between Sessions**:
- Automatic advances
- Offscreen actions
- Time passage
- World keeps moving

---

### Modifying Clocks

**Can you change clock mid-use?**
**Yes**:
- Add segments if scope increases
- Remove segments if accelerating

- Adjust based on PC actions

**Clocks are tools, not rigid rules**
