## Advantage/Disadvantage Interaction

### Single Source vs Multiple
```
1 source of Advantage = Advantage
Multiple sources of Advantage = Still just Advantage
(Same for Disadvantage)
```

### Advantage + Disadvantage
```
Any Advantage + Any Disadvantage = CANCEL
Result: Straight roll (2d6, no modification)

Even if:
- 3 sources of Advantage + 1 source of Disadvantage = Straight roll
- 1 source of Advantage + 5 sources of Disadvantage = Straight roll
```

## Decision Matrix

### When Circumstance is...
| Situation | Mechanical Effect |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Exceptionally favorable** | Advantage |
| **Somewhat favorable** | +2 bonus (no advantage) |
| **Standard** | No modifier |
| **Somewhat unfavorable** | -2 penalty (no disadvantage) |
| **Exceptionally unfavorable** | Disadvantage |

---

## Advantage vs Bonus

### Use Advantage When
- Circumstantial benefit
- Represents opportunity, not skill
- Situational, not permanent
- Multiple factors combine

### Use Bonus When
- Permanent character ability
- Specific numerical benefit
- Stacks with other effects
- Represents training/gear

### Can Use Both
```
Example: Expert lockpicking
- Thievery skill: +2 (bonus)
- Lockpicking proficiency: +1 (bonus)  
- Quality tools: +2 (bonus)
- Guards distracted: Advantage
Total: 2d6+5 with advantage
```

---

## Edge Cases

### Do I grant Advantage or lower DC?
**Advantage**: Circumstantial, temporary benefit
**Lower DC**: Task itself is easier
```
Example: Climbing
- Rope ladder = Lower DC (task is easier)
- Ally belaying you = Advantage (help, but still same difficulty)
```

### Multiple reasons for same Advantage?
**Still just one Advantage**
```
Example: Three reasons for combat advantage
- High ground
- Enemy distracted
- Ally flanking
Result: Just roll with advantage once (not 3x)
```

### Advantage on already easy task?
**Advantage still applies**
```
Even with advantage, can still roll poorly
Advantage on DC 6 task is not auto-success
```

### Disadvantage on already hard task?
**Disadvantage still applies**
```
Makes hard task even less likely to succeed
May become effectively impossible
```

---

## Probability Reference

### Success Rates (with +2 skill)

| DC | Normal | With Advantage | With Disadvantage |
|----|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 6  | 95% | 99%+ | 83% |
| 8  | 85% | 95% | 64% |
| 10 | 70% | 87% | 44% |
| 12 | 50% | 72% | 25% |
| 14 | 30% | 51% | 11% |
| 16 | 15% | 28% | 3% |

**Key Insight**: 
- Advantage roughly equivalent to +3 bonus
- Disadvantage roughly equivalent to -3 penalty
- Impact is greatest at moderate DCs (10-12)
