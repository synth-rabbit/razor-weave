## Common Character Sheet Mistakes {#common-character-sheet-mistakes}

### Mistake 1: Over-Specialization {#mistake-1-over-specialization}

**Error:** All skills and proficiencies focused on one area (e.g., pure combat,
zero social or investigation).

**Problem:** You're ineffective when situations fall outside your domain. The
party carries you through non-combat scenes.

**Fix:** Spread skills across 2-3 areas. Combat specialist? Add Perception or
Tactics. Social character? Add at least one combat or utility skill.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Attributes {#mistake-2-ignoring-attributes}

**Error:** All attributes at +0 or +1. Skills compensate for weak base stats.

**Problem:** Without strong attributes, your skill bonuses are undercut. You
need both to succeed consistently.

**Fix:** Focus 1-2 attributes to +2 or higher. Let skills and proficiencies
build on strong foundations.

### Mistake 3: Redundant Skills {#mistake-3-redundant-skills}

**Error:** Taking overlapping skills that do the same thing (*Blades* and
*Brawling* both cover melee; *Stealth* and *Infiltration* are redundant).

**Problem:** Wasted picks. You could have diversified.

**Fix:** Cover different niches. One combat skill, one social, one investigation,
one utility. Avoid redundancy.

### Mistake 4: No Resources or Connections {#mistake-4-no-resources-or-connections}

**Error:** Gear and skills defined, but no contacts, no faction ties, no backstory
hooks.

**Problem:** You're disconnected from the world. No leverage, no narrative ties.

**Fix:** Define at least 2-3 contacts or faction relationships. These create
story hooks and provide resources.

### Mistake 5: Unclear Concept {#mistake-5-unclear-concept}

**Error:** Stats exist, but no clear character concept. "What do you do?" "Uh...
I have Blades and Stealth?"

**Problem:** You don't know how to roleplay the character. Concept guides choices.

**Fix:** Write a one-sentence concept: *Cynical detective seeking redemption*,
*Reckless smuggler with a heart of gold*, *Haunted scholar running from the past*.
Let stats support concept, not define it.

## Troubleshooting Character Creation {#troubleshooting-character-creation}

### "My character feels weak." {#my-character-feels-weak}

**Diagnosis:**

- Check if attributes support your skills. High skill without high attribute =
  inconsistent success.
- Check if you're using proficiencies. Proficiencies grant narrative permissions
  and mechanical edges.
- Check if you're leveraging gear and resources. Contacts, tools, and favors
  create advantages.

**Fix:** Focus attributes, align skills with attributes, use proficiencies and
gear actively.

### "I don't fit with the party." {#i-dont-fit-with-the-party}

**Diagnosis:**

- Check if your skills overlap too much (two investigators, no combat) or too
  little (no shared goals).
- Check if backstory ties you to the party. No shared history = weak cohesion.

**Fix:** Adjust skills to fill gaps. Add backstory connection to at least one
party member. Discuss party composition in Session Zero.

### "I don't know what to do in scenes." {#i-dont-know-what-to-do-in-scenes}

**Diagnosis:**

- Check if your skills are too narrow. If you only have combat skills, non-combat
  scenes leave you sidelined.
- Check if you have clear motivations. No goals = no drive.

**Fix:** Diversify skills. Define clear motivations (revenge, redemption,
curiosity, survival). Ask GM for scenes that engage your character.
