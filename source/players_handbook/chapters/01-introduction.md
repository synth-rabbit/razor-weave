# Introduction {#ph-introduction}

You're about to step into a world shaped by dice, decisions, and shared imagination. Whether you're completely new to tabletop roleplaying or a veteran learning a new system, this guide will teach you everything you need to create compelling characters, interact with the rules, and work with your group to tell unforgettable stories.

This isn't just a manual—it's an invitation to collaborative storytelling. You'll learn how to build characters with depth and mechanical teeth, navigate the fiction through meaningful choices, and engage with a system designed to support bold action and dramatic consequences. The game adapts to your group's preferred style, whether you crave tactical combat, tense investigation, social intrigue, or a mix of everything.

## What You Need to Know First {#what-you-need-to-know-first}

Before we dive into the details, let's establish some core concepts:

**The GM (Game Master)** is the person who facilitates the game. They describe the world, portray non-player characters (NPCs—characters not controlled by players), adjudicate rules, and frame situations. Think of them as your collaborative partner, not an opponent. The GM sets scenes and challenges, but everyone at the table works together to create compelling stories.

**Your PC (Player Character)** is the character you create and control. You decide what they do, how they approach problems, and what drives them. Your PC is your lens into the game world and your primary means of engaging with the story.

**Sessions and Campaigns**: A session is a single play session, typically 2-4 hours. Multiple connected sessions form a campaign—a longer story told over weeks or months. Some campaigns are episodic (self-contained stories each session), while others build toward major narrative arcs.

**Collaborative Storytelling**: This game thrives on collaboration. The GM frames situations and interprets outcomes, but you drive the action through your choices. Everyone contributes to the emerging narrative. When you roll dice, you're not just checking for success—you're determining how the story shifts in response to your actions.

## What This Game Is About {#what-this-game-is-about}

At its core, this is a game about **meaningful choices and their consequences**. You make decisions that matter. Outcomes reshape the world. Pressure builds toward resolution. The system handles uncertainty and translates your actions into dynamic results that drive the story forward.

### Genre Flexibility {#genre-flexibility}

The game is deliberately **genre-flexible**. The core mechanics adapt to support:

- **Heroic Fantasy**: Bold adventurers facing dangerous quests, ancient evils, and larger-than-life stakes. Think legendary heroes, epic battles, and world-threatening dangers.
- **Cozy Slice-of-Life**: Low-stakes stories focused on community, relationships, and personal growth. Run a tavern, solve neighborhood disputes, or navigate the drama of small-town life.
- **Mystery & Horror**: Tense investigations, atmospheric dread, and dangerous secrets. Uncover conspiracies, survive supernatural threats, or solve crimes in the shadows.
- **Modern Settings**: Contemporary crime, espionage, urban fantasy, or everyday drama. Navigate complex social systems, corporate intrigue, or street-level conflicts.
- **Science Fiction**: Space exploration, cyberpunk intrigue, transhumanism, or post-apocalyptic survival. The mechanics scale from intimate personal stories to galaxy-spanning conflicts.

You bring the setting and tone. The system provides structure for action, consequence, and momentum. The same rules that govern a wizard's arcane duel work equally well for a detective's interrogation or a pilot's desperate maneuver through an asteroid field.

### Core Themes {#core-themes}

Across all genres and tones, the game emphasizes:

**Risk and Consequence**: Your actions have weight. Success creates opportunities. Failure introduces complications. Every roll shapes the fiction.

**Momentum**: The game pushes forward. Even failures move the story rather than stalling it. Partial successes give you progress with a cost. The narrative builds toward climactic moments.

**Agency**: You control your character's choices and approach. The GM frames situations, but you decide how to engage. Your decisions drive the story.

**Meaningful Outcomes**: Mechanics translate into fiction. A good roll isn't just "you succeed"—it's "you pick the lock silently, find a hidden compartment, and recognize the maker's mark as belonging to a notorious guild."

### Supported Playstyles {#supported-playstyles}

The system flexibly supports different ways to play. Most groups blend multiple styles, but understanding these approaches helps you communicate preferences and choose the right tools for your table.

#### Activity-Based Styles {#activity-based-styles}

**Combat-Focused Play**: Tactical encounters with meaningful terrain, positioning, and dynamic actions. Each fight creates choices and escalation. You'll care about the battlefield's tags (environmental descriptors like "Elevated," "Fragile Cover," "Cramped"), your position relative to allies and enemies, and the tactical options available each turn.

**Investigation-Heavy Play**: Clue gathering, deduction, and problem-solving. Progress clocks track your investigative leads. Partial successes reveal information with complications—you find the evidence but alert the conspirators, or learn a crucial fact but misinterpret its significance.

**Social Intrigue**: Negotiation, deception, relationship management, and political maneuvering. Social contests resolve conflicting goals. Reputation and leverage matter as much as combat prowess.

**Exploration**: Discovery, navigation, and survival. Momentum mechanics keep pacing tight while still capturing the sense of journey and the dangers of unknown territory.

#### Time Commitment Styles {#time-commitment-styles}

**Casual Play** (2-3 hours monthly): You want quick setup, low prep, and satisfying progress even with irregular sessions. The system supports this through:

- **Fast character creation**: Use archetypes (Chapter 20) for ready-to-play characters in 10 minutes. No optimization anxiety—archetypes are balanced and functional out of the box.
- **Session-based advancement**: Progress every 3-4 sessions regardless of narrative pacing, so irregular attendance doesn't stall growth.
- **Episodic structure**: Self-contained scenarios let you miss sessions without losing narrative thread. Each session resolves its core conflict.
- **Minimal bookkeeping**: No encumbrance, ration tracking, or detailed inventory management. Focus on story, not spreadsheets.

**Weekend Play** (3-4 hours weekly): Standard campaign pacing. Most content in this guide assumes weekly play. You'll build deeper character arcs, engage with longer story threads, and have time for downtime activities between adventures.

**Hardcore/Marathon Play** (6+ hours, multiple sessions per week): You want depth, complexity, and optimization. The system rewards this through:

- **Optimization paths**: Build synergies between skills, proficiencies, and tactics (see Chapter 04 for build guidance).
- **Complex scenarios**: The advanced combat and social examples (Chapters 06-07) provide templates for intricate tactical situations.
- **Interconnected arcs**: Multiple progress clocks tracking simultaneous goals let you juggle faction relationships, personal quests, and campaign objectives.
- **Downtime depth**: Use downtime activities (Chapter 12) to pursue side projects, build influence, and develop your character between adventures.

#### Player Count Styles {#player-count-styles}

**Solo Play** (1 player, no GM): You're the player and referee simultaneously. The system provides:

- **Oracle mechanics**: Use the Solo Play tools (Chapter 12: Alternative Play Modes) to answer questions when uncertain. "Does the guard notice me?" Roll dice, consult tables, interpret results.
- **NPC behavior tables**: Simple/medium/complex enemy behavior generators help you adjudicate opponent actions fairly without GM bias.
- **Scene structure**: Frameworks for pacing solo sessions—exploration beats, action beats, resolution beats—keep narrative momentum.
- **Self-sufficient builds**: Character archetypes flagged for solo viability balance offense, defense, and utility so you can handle diverse challenges alone.

Solo play works best with lower stakes (investigation, personal goals) than epic group campaigns. You're writing interactive fiction more than traditional TTRPG play.

**Duet Play** (1 GM + 1 player): Intimate, character-focused stories with deeper relationships and personal stakes. See Chapter 12 for character design, pacing adjustments, and companion NPC guidance.

**GM-less Play** (rotating authority): Distribute GMing responsibilities across all players using structured turn-taking and collaborative adjudication. See Chapter 12 for authority rotation models and tools.

**Online Play** (virtual tabletops or voice chat): Play remotely using digital tools. Requires adapted communication, pacing, and technical setup. See Chapter 12 for platform choices, best practices, and common pitfalls.

**Standard Group** (1 GM, 3-5 players): The sweet spot for this system. Party composition balances naturally—you don't need rigid roles (tank, healer, DPS). Overlap in capabilities creates interesting tactical choices rather than redundancy.

**Large Group** (1 GM, 6+ players): Possible but challenging. The GM needs strong spotlight management. Popcorn initiative (each player names the next to act) prevents alpha players from dominating. Keep encounters dynamic—static fights with 6+ players drag unless environmental pressure (spreading fire, collapsing structure) forces urgency.

#### Engagement Intensity Styles {#engagement-intensity-styles}

**Optimization-Focused** (theorycrafting, build synergies): You love maximizing effectiveness. The system rewards this through:

- **Skill synergies**: Combine complementary skills for advantage (Stealth + Subterfuge for infiltration).
- **Proficiency stacking**: Select proficiencies that compound effectiveness in your specialty.
- **Tactical positioning**: Mastering terrain tags, flanking, and environmental effects gives significant advantages in combat.
- **Build archetypes**: Chapter 04 provides optimization paths (Tactician, Social Manipulator, Technical Specialist) with worked progression examples.

**Narrative-Focused** (story, character arcs, drama): You prioritize compelling fiction over mechanical optimization. The system supports this through:

- **Meaningful outcomes**: Partial successes create dramatic complications, not just binary pass/fail.
- **Fiction-first resolution**: The GM adjudicates based on your described approach, not rigid skill lists.
- **Character progression tied to arcs**: Advancement reflects narrative change (Chapter 04), not grinding XP.
- **Thematic choices**: Mechanics support choosing "what my character would do" over "what's tactically optimal."

**Balanced** (both mechanics and story): Most tables blend optimization and narrative focus. Build mechanically effective characters, then make thematically appropriate choices during play. The system doesn't force you to choose between effectiveness and drama—you can have both.

The GM tailors scenes to your group's interests. Don't feel locked into one style—most campaigns naturally blend multiple approaches as the story develops.

### What This Game Is Not {#what-this-game-is-not}

Setting expectations helps avoid frustration. This system prioritizes certain design goals, which means deliberately excluding others:

**Not Granular Simulation**: The game doesn't track detailed inventory weights, precise economics, complex physics, or minute-by-minute timekeeping. If you love calculating encumbrance and managing rations, this system will feel loose. We prioritize narrative momentum over simulationist detail.

**Not Zero-to-Hero Progression**: Characters are competent from session one. You're not playing a helpless apprentice who spends twenty sessions becoming capable. Progression focuses on narrative arcs, new capabilities, and expanding your character's influence rather than grinding stat increases.

**Not GM-vs-Players**: The GM facilitates and adjudicates, but everyone collaborates. The GM's goal isn't to "beat" the players or protect their meticulously planned plot. Instead, they frame interesting situations, present meaningful challenges, and interpret outcomes fairly. If your group prefers adversarial play, this system will frustrate those expectations.

**Not Combat-Only**: While the system handles tactical combat well, it gives equal mechanical support to social contests, investigative progress, exploration challenges, and downtime activities. If you only care about optimized combat builds, you'll find plenty of depth—but you'll also encounter robust systems for non-combat play.

## Your Core Responsibilities as a Player {#your-core-responsibilities}

Understanding what you bring to the table helps everyone collaborate effectively. As a player, you have three primary responsibilities:

### Engaged Choices {#engaged-choices}

Make decisions that matter. Don't wait for the GM to prompt you—drive your character forward. When the GM describes a situation, consider what your character would do and declare it. "I want to check the room for traps" beats silence or passively waiting for instructions.

Engaged choices mean:
- **Declaring actions with clear intent**: Tell the GM what you're trying to accomplish, not just what dice to roll.
- **Taking initiative**: When scenes feel static, push them forward. Investigate the suspicious detail, confront the evasive NPC, or propose a risky plan.
- **Embracing consequences**: Accept outcomes, even unfavorable ones. Roll with failures and complications rather than arguing for do-overs.
- **Making thematic choices**: Sometimes the dramatically appropriate choice isn't the tactically optimal one. That's okay—compelling stories emerge from characters making choices true to who they are.

### Clear Intent {#clear-intent}

When you declare an action, communicate your goal and approach. "I want to sneak past the guard using the shadows near the pillars" is vastly more useful than "I roll stealth."

Clear intent allows the GM to:
- **Set appropriate DCs** based on your approach and the situation
- **Grant advantage or disadvantage** based on your chosen method
- **Frame meaningful stakes** for what happens on different outcomes
- **Interpret results narratively** in ways that connect to your goal

Example of clear vs. unclear intent:

**Unclear**: "I want to persuade the merchant."

**Clear**: "I want to convince the merchant to give us a discount by appealing to her greed—mentioning we'll be repeat customers if the price is right and subtly implying we have lucrative connections."

The clear version gives the GM everything they need to adjudicate the action fairly and narrate a compelling outcome.

### Collaborative Problem-Solving {#collaborative-problem-solving}

Work with your group. Share the spotlight. Build on each other's ideas. If someone's stuck, offer support or create openings for them.

Collaborative problem-solving looks like:
- **Supporting other characters' actions**: When a teammate creates an opportunity, take it. "While she distracts the guard, I'll slip through the side entrance."
- **Offering tactical assistance**: Set up allies for success. "I'll pin the enemy down with covering fire so you can flank them."
- **Contributing to group planning**: Share your character's expertise and perspective during discussions. Don't dominate, but don't stay silent either.
- **Rotating spotlight**: If you've had several consecutive scenes focused on your character, create space for others. Ask another player what their character thinks or does.
- **Building on contributions**: When someone adds a detail to the fiction, accept and expand on it rather than contradicting or ignoring it.

## Collaborative Dynamics {#collaborative-dynamics}

Understanding how players and GM work together helps create a positive table culture.

### The Player-GM Partnership {#player-gm-partnership}

This game works through player-GM collaboration, not opposition. The GM frames situations and adjudicates outcomes. You describe actions and face consequences. Together, you create compelling stories.

The GM's role:
- **Frame situations** with interesting challenges and meaningful choices
- **Adjudicate outcomes** fairly based on the fiction and mechanics
- **Portray the world** and its NPCs with consistency and depth
- **Maintain pace** by knowing when to zoom in for detail and when to summarize
- **Support player agency** by respecting their choices and building on their contributions

Your role:
- **Drive action** through your character's choices
- **Engage with the world** by asking questions and investigating details
- **Accept outcomes** gracefully, even when they complicate your plans
- **Collaborate** with other players to create satisfying group dynamics
- **Communicate** your preferences, comfort levels, and character goals

Neither role is subordinate. You need each other to make the game work.

### Safety and Consent {#safety-and-consent}

Tabletop roleplaying can explore intense themes, but it should always feel safe for everyone at the table. Use safety tools to ensure comfort and respect everyone's boundaries without question.

**X-Card**: The X-Card is a simple tool anyone can use at any time to say "I'm not comfortable with this content." How it works:

- Place an index card marked with an "X" in the center of the table (or use a digital equivalent in online play)
- Anyone can tap or reference the X-Card when content makes them uncomfortable
- When the X-Card is used, immediately stop the current content. No questions asked. No explanation required.
- The GM either rewinds the scene to before the uncomfortable content or fast-forwards past it
- The game continues without discussing what prompted the X-Card use unless the person who used it wants to discuss it privately

The X-Card creates safety because it requires zero justification. You don't need a "good enough" reason. Your discomfort is reason enough.

**Lines and Veils**: Lines and Veils establish content boundaries before play begins:

- **Lines** are hard boundaries—content that won't appear in the game at all. Examples: sexual violence, harm to children, graphic torture, specific phobias.
- **Veils** are content that can exist in the game world but "fades to black" rather than being described in detail. Examples: sexual content (it happens off-screen), violence (described in outcome but not gory detail), substance abuse.

Establish Lines and Veils during Session Zero (the first session where you discuss expectations rather than playing). Write them down. Respect them absolutely. Lines and Veils can be added or modified during play if someone realizes additional boundaries are needed.

**Check-Ins**: Especially when playing intense or emotionally challenging content, periodic check-ins help maintain safety:

- The GM can pause between scenes to ask "Everyone good to continue?"
- Players can request a brief break if they need to decompress
- After sessions with particularly intense content, debrief as a group

Safety tools aren't about censorship or restricting creative expression. They're about ensuring everyone can engage with the game comfortably. A player who feels unsafe can't engage fully with the story.

### Reading the Table {#reading-the-table}

Pay attention to your group's energy and adjust accordingly:

**When someone's disengaged**: Create space for them. Ask their character what they think or do. Set up an opportunity that plays to their character's strengths.

**When tension's high**: Offer levity or a moment to breathe. Sometimes a joke, a brief aside, or a shift in scene tone helps.

**When pacing drags**: Push forward. Declare a bold action. Force a decision. Ask the GM a pointed question that demands resolution.

**When someone's uncomfortable**: Even without an explicit X-Card use, watch for body language, disengagement, or visible discomfort. It's okay to privately check in with someone during a break.

Reading the table is a skill that develops with practice and attention. Start by simply paying attention to others' faces and engagement levels.

### Building Fiction Through "Yes, And" {#yes-and}

Fiction at the table builds through **acceptance and addition**:

**Accept what's established**: If the GM says the hallway's dark, it is. If another player's character is cautious, respect that. Don't contradict established facts unless the group explicitly embraces collaborative world-building where players contribute setting details.

**Add meaningful details**: Enrich scenes through your contributions. "I notice scorch marks on the walls" adds texture. "I draw my blade quietly" shows your approach. These details give the GM material to build on.

**Support others' contributions**: When someone creates an opportunity—"I distract the guard"—take it. "I slip past while they're focused on you" builds momentum. When a player adds a detail about their character's backstory or motivation, incorporate it into your character's perspective.

"Yes, and" builds momentum. "No, but" stops it. Even when characters disagree, you as players should be adding to each other's contributions rather than negating them.

Example of "Yes, And" in action:

**GM**: "The noble's study is lavishly decorated. Expensive art on the walls, thick rugs, a desk made of imported wood."

**Player 1**: "I notice the desk has a hidden compartment—there's a slight seam in the wood grain that doesn't match."

**GM**: "Yes, and when you examine it closely, you smell a faint chemical odor from that seam. Something was recently placed in or removed from that compartment."

**Player 2**: "I recognize that smell—it's Serpent's Breath, a rare poison. My character dealt with it once before."

**GM**: "Yes, and that memory reminds you: Serpent's Breath only remains potent for about six hours after exposure to air. Whatever was poisoned is recently gone."

Each contribution builds on the previous one, enriching the scene and creating narrative momentum.

## What This Guide Does Not Cover {#what-this-guide-does-not-cover}

This guide focuses on player essentials. It doesn't teach you how to run the game—see the [GM Toolkit](../../gm_toolkit/chapters/01-introduction.md#gm-introduction). It doesn't provide exhaustive mechanical catalogs—those live in the [Mechanics Reference](../../mechanics_reference/chapters/01-introduction.md#introduction). We link to those resources when you need deeper context.

Specifically, you won't find:
- **GM procedures**: Scene framing, adjudication principles, campaign prep
- **Comprehensive mechanic catalogs**: Complete skill lists, all proficiencies, full condition/tag libraries
- **Narrative structure guidance**: How to build story arcs, create compelling villains, design mysteries
- **Worldbuilding**: Setting-specific lore, genre-specific tools, campaign frameworks
- **Advanced GM techniques**: Improvisation, pacing, managing table dynamics from the GM side

All of these topics are covered in depth in other books. This guide assumes the GM has those resources and focuses exclusively on what players need to know.
