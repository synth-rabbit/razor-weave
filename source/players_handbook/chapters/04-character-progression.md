# Character Progression {#ph-character-progression}

## Progression Overview {#progression-overview}

Character progression means two things: **mechanical growth** (new skills,
proficiencies, attribute improvements) and **narrative evolution** (character
arcs, changing motivations, deepening relationships).

Both matter. Mechanics give you new tools. Narrative gives you context for why
you've changed and where you're headed.

## Advancement Mechanics {#advancement-mechanics}

Your character grows through **advancement opportunities** tied to play. Common
triggers:

- **Completing arcs:** Resolve a personal story beat, achieve a major goal, or
  overcome a defining challenge.
- **Milestones:** Reach narrative checkpoints set by the GM (end of an
  adventure, major turning point).
- **Session-based:** Advance after a set number of sessions (every 3–4
  sessions).

When you advance, you typically gain:

- **New skill:** Add a skill from an adjacent package or expand your expertise.
- **New proficiency:** Gain narrative permission and mechanical edge in a new
  area.
- **Attribute improvement:** Rare; tied to major milestones or transformative
  arcs.

Work with your GM to choose advancements that fit your character's story.

## Narrative Arcs {#narrative-arcs}

Progression shines when **mechanical growth reflects narrative change**.

If your character learns to distrust authority after betrayal, gain a
proficiency like *Skeptical Investigator*. If they train with a master
duelist, gain *Blades* or improve MIG/AGI. If they uncover arcane secrets,
expand into *Arcane Lore*.

**Character arcs** give progression meaning. Ask:

- What has my character learned?
- How have they changed?
- What new goals or conflicts have emerged?

Mechanical advancements should answer these questions.

## Milestone vs. Session-Based {#milestone-vs-session-based}

Tables use different progression models:

**Milestone-Based:** Advance at story checkpoints (end of an arc, major
victory, transformative event). Ties progression tightly to fiction. Pacing
varies by campaign.

**Session-Based:** Advance every X sessions (typically 3–4). Predictable,
ensures regular growth regardless of narrative pacing.

Your GM chooses the model that fits your campaign. Both work well. Milestones
emphasize story. Session-based ensures steady growth.

## Worked Example {#worked-example}

**Character:** Kira, the street-smart investigator (from Chapter 05)

**Arc Completed:** After six sessions, Kira exposed the crime family
responsible for her partner's disappearance. She didn't get revenge—her
partner was already dead—but she brought the killers to justice and learned
to trust her new crew.

**Narrative Change:** Kira entered the campaign distrustful and isolated. She
now values her allies and has begun letting go of guilt over her partner's
death.

**Advancement Choice:** Kira gains the *Tactical Coordination* proficiency,
reflecting her growth as a team player. She also adds *Street Combat* to her
skill set after multiple dangerous confrontations. Both choices tie directly
to her arc: she's learned to fight alongside others and trust them in tight
spots.

**Result:** Mechanically, Kira is more effective in group combat. Narratively,
her character has evolved from lone wolf to team player. Both dimensions
reinforce each other.

## Optimization and Build Paths {#optimization-and-build-paths}

For players who enjoy theorycrafting and maximizing effectiveness, this section
provides frameworks for building synergistic character capabilities. You don't
need to optimize—competent characters emerge from following your narrative
instincts. But if you enjoy the puzzle of capability stacking, these patterns
help.

### Specialization vs. Generalization {#specialization-vs-generalization}

**Specialists** excel dramatically in one area but have gaps elsewhere:

- **Advantages**: Mastery grants reliability. High skill bonuses mean consistent
  success on checks in your specialty. Proficiencies compound your edge. You
  become the go-to expert for specific challenges.
- **Disadvantages**: Dependency on party support for gaps. Limited versatility
  when your specialty isn't relevant. Risk of redundancy if another PC shares
  your focus.
- **Best for**: Group play with complementary specialists. Solo play requires
  generalization—avoid narrow specialization if you're the only PC.

**Generalists** handle diverse challenges adequately but rarely excel:

- **Advantages**: Flexibility. You contribute meaningfully across combat, social,
  and exploration challenges. No dead weight—always have relevant skills.
- **Disadvantages**: Never the best at anything. Specialists outperform you in
  their domain. Mediocrity in optimization-heavy tables.
- **Best for**: Solo play, small groups (2-3 PCs), or tables that value
  versatility over mastery.

**Hybrid Approach** (recommended): Specialize in 2-3 areas, maintain competence
in others. Example: Combat primary, social secondary, basic exploration
capability. You dominate your focus while contributing elsewhere.

### Skill Synergies {#skill-synergies}

Certain skill combinations create compound advantages:

**Investigation + Social** (Detective/Interrogator):
- **Research** (find clues) + **Insight** (read suspects) + **Persuasion**
  (extract confessions)
- **Why it works**: Information gathering flows naturally from evidence to
  people. Each skill advances your investigative goals.
- **Proficiency pairing**: *Keen Observer* (notice details) + *Silver Tongue*
  (manipulate conversations)

**Combat + Athletics** (Mobile Warrior):
- **Melee/Ranged Combat** + **Athletics** (climb, jump, maneuver)
- **Why it works**: Positioning is combat advantage. Athletics lets you claim
  high ground, leap obstacles, or pursue fleeing enemies.
- **Proficiency pairing**: *Acrobatic Fighter* (move and attack) + *Parkour*
  (navigate terrain freely)

**Stealth + Technical** (Infiltrator):
- **Stealth** (move unseen) + **Security** (bypass locks) + **Subterfuge**
  (disguise, forgery)
- **Why it works**: Infiltration requires layered capabilities. One skill gets
  you in, others sustain the deception and handle obstacles.
- **Proficiency pairing**: *Shadow Walker* (blend with environment) + *Lock
  Specialist* (open anything)

**Social + Deception** (Manipulator):
- **Persuasion** (convince) + **Deception** (lie convincingly) + **Insight**
  (read motives)
- **Why it works**: Social manipulation requires reading people, crafting
  believable stories, and selling them. Each skill supports the others.
- **Proficiency pairing**: *Con Artist* (elaborate deceptions) + *Poker Face*
  (unreadable intentions)

**Technical + Lore** (Problem Solver):
- **Technical skills** (Engineering, Medicine, etc.) + **Relevant Lore**
  (understand context)
- **Why it works**: Technical competence without context is guesswork. Lore lets
  you anticipate problems and apply technical skills meaningfully.
- **Proficiency pairing**: *Engineer* (build/repair) + *Scholar* (deep knowledge)

### Build Archetypes {#build-archetypes}

These templates provide optimization paths. You don't need to follow them
rigidly—use them as inspiration for synergistic capability sets.

#### Tactician (Combat Specialist)

**Core Concept**: Dominate tactical situations through positioning, terrain use,
and action economy mastery.

**Primary Skills**: Melee or Ranged Combat, Athletics, Tactics
**Secondary Skills**: Perception (battlefield awareness), Intimidation (control
opponents)
**Key Proficiencies**: *Combat Veteran* (bonus in fights), *Tactical Mind*
(advantage on setup actions), *Mobile Combatant* (move and strike)

**Advancement Path**:
1. **Early** (Sessions 1-6): Establish combat dominance. Take Combat skill and
   *Combat Veteran* proficiency.
2. **Mid** (Sessions 7-12): Add Athletics for positioning. Take *Mobile
   Combatant* to combine movement with attacks.
3. **Late** (Sessions 13+): Add Tactics for team coordination. Take *Tactical
   Mind* to grant allies advantages.

**Optimization Notes**: Stack advantage sources—flanking + elevation + setup
actions = consistent success. Focus on creating opportunities for allies, not
just personal damage output. Learn enemy weaknesses through Tactics checks
before engaging.

#### Social Manipulator (Social Specialist)

**Core Concept**: Control social situations through persuasion, deception, and
information gathering.

**Primary Skills**: Persuasion, Deception, Insight
**Secondary Skills**: Relevant Lore (context for manipulation), Streetwise
(navigate social networks)
**Key Proficiencies**: *Silver Tongue* (bonus on social checks), *Poker Face*
(hide intentions), *Network* (contacts everywhere)

**Advancement Path**:
1. **Early** (Sessions 1-6): Establish social dominance. Take Persuasion and
   *Silver Tongue*.
2. **Mid** (Sessions 7-12): Add Deception for flexibility. Take *Poker Face* to
   prevent Insight checks against you.
3. **Late** (Sessions 13+): Add Insight to read opponents. Take *Network* for
   access to information and resources.

**Optimization Notes**: Multi-round social contests favor you—each round builds
advantage. Leverage NPC traits (*Greedy*, *Honorable*) by framing offers to
align with their values. Use Insight before negotiating to identify leverage
points.

#### Technical Specialist (Problem Solver)

**Core Concept**: Handle technical challenges, crafting, and specialized
knowledge.

**Primary Skills**: Engineering, Medicine, or Science (choose 2-3 technical
domains)
**Secondary Skills**: Relevant Lore, Perception (notice technical details)
**Key Proficiencies**: *Engineer* (build/repair), *Field Medic* (stabilize
injuries), *Inventor* (create solutions)

**Advancement Path**:
1. **Early** (Sessions 1-6): Establish technical mastery. Take 2 technical
   skills and *Engineer*.
2. **Mid** (Sessions 7-12): Add Lore for context. Take *Inventor* to create
   custom solutions.
3. **Late** (Sessions 13+): Add third technical domain or broaden to
   investigation skills. Take *Master Craftsman* for exceptional quality.

**Optimization Notes**: Technical specialists shine in preparation. Use downtime
to craft gear, research problems, or prototype solutions. Pre-game planning lets
you bring the right tool for anticipated challenges.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls {#avoiding-common-pitfalls}

**Over-Specialization**: Taking only combat skills leaves you useless in social
or exploration scenes. Aim for at least 2 capability domains (e.g., combat +
social, or investigation + technical).

**Redundancy**: If another PC is the party's face, adding Persuasion as your
primary creates overlap without adding value. Choose complementary capabilities
instead.

**Neglecting Narrative**: Optimization without character integration feels
hollow. Why does your character have these skills? How do they reflect who they
are? Mechanics should support story, not replace it.

**Chasing Perfection**: "Optimal" builds assume perfect information and
controlled conditions. Real play is messy. Competent, flexible characters
outperform hyper-specialized optimizations when plans go sideways.
