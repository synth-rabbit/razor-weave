## Quick Tips for Players {#quick-tips}

**Start with Fiction**: Begin with who your character is, not their stats. Identity drives mechanics, not the other way around.

**Party Integration**: Create at least one relationship or shared connection with another PC during character creation.

**Leave Hooks**: Build unresolved mysteries, important relationships, or ongoing quests into your backstory. Give your GM problems to resolve, not perfect heroes with nothing to prove.

**Mechanical Coherence**: When someone reads your skill list, they should understand who your character is without reading the backstory.

**Genre Appropriateness**: Ensure skills, proficiencies, and gear match your campaign's genre and tone.
