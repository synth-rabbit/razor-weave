# Alternative Play Modes {#ph-alternative-play-modes}

The standard table configuration—one GM and 3-5 players, meeting in person—is
just one way to play. This chapter covers alternative configurations: solo play
(no GM), duet play (1 GM + 1 player), GM-less play (rotating authority), and
online play (virtual tabletops). Each mode requires adapting the system's
tools, but the core mechanics remain consistent.

## Solo Play {#solo-play}

Playing without a GM is possible using oracle mechanics, random tables, and
structured decision frameworks. Solo play requires you to wear both hats—player
and GM—which changes how you approach challenges, pacing, and narrative
structure.

### Oracle Mechanics {#oracle-mechanics}

**Oracles** answer yes/no questions when you need the world to respond to your
actions. Instead of a GM ruling, you roll to determine outcomes or facts.

**Basic Oracle (d6):**

Roll 1d6 when you ask a yes/no question:

- **6:** Yes, and... (extra benefit)
- **4-5:** Yes
- **3:** Yes, but... (complication)
- **2:** No, but... (silver lining)
- **1:** No, and... (additional problem)

**When to Use:**

- "Is the guard asleep?" Roll oracle.
- "Do I know someone in this city?" Roll oracle.
- "Is the door unlocked?" Roll oracle.

Oracles **don't replace skill checks**. Use them for environmental questions,
NPC behavior, or world state. Use skill checks for your character's actions.

**Example:**

**You:** "I approach the merchant's shop. Is it open this late?"

**Oracle Roll:** 2 (No, but...)

**Interpretation:** The shop is closed, but you notice a light on in the back
room—someone's still there. You could knock.

### Advanced Oracle: Weighted Questions {#weighted-questions}

For questions with likelihood, adjust the oracle:

**Likely (roll with Advantage):** "Is the nobleman at the gala?" (He's a
regular—Advantage makes 'Yes' more probable)

**Unlikely (roll with Disadvantage):** "Is there a hidden escape tunnel?"
(Rare—Disadvantage makes 'No' more probable)

**Certain:** Skip the roll. If it's obvious ("Is the sun up at noon?"), don't
roll.

### NPC Behavior Tables {#npc-behavior-tables}

When you encounter an NPC, roll to determine their disposition and goals. This
prevents you from creating only helpful or hostile NPCs.

**NPC Disposition (d6):**

- **1:** Hostile (attacks, refuses, sabotages)
- **2:** Unfriendly (suspicious, demands payment, unhelpful)
- **3:** Cautious (neutral, needs convincing)
- **4:** Neutral (willing to talk, no strong opinion)
- **5:** Friendly (helpful, offers info or aid)
- **6:** Enthusiastic (eager to help, volunteers extra)

**NPC Goals (d6):**

- **1:** Profit (wants money, trade, or valuable info)
- **2:** Safety (avoids danger, seeks protection)
- **3:** Status (cares about reputation, honor, respect)
- **4:** Knowledge (curious, seeks information or secrets)
- **5:** Connection (lonely, wants companionship or allies)
- **6:** Duty (bound by obligation, follows rules or orders)

**Example:**

**You:** "I approach the tavern keeper for info about the missing merchant."

**Disposition Roll:** 3 (Cautious)

**Goal Roll:** 1 (Profit)

**Interpretation:** The tavern keeper knows something but won't talk for free.
They hint at information, then wait for you to offer coin. You can negotiate,
intimidate, or walk away.

### Surprise and Discovery Tables {#surprise-discovery-tables}

Solo play benefits from unexpected twists. When exploring or investigating, roll
for surprises to keep play dynamic.

**Discovery Table (d6):**

- **1:** Setback (obstacle, trap, or complication)
- **2:** Empty (nothing useful, but no harm)
- **3:** Clue (progress toward goal)
- **4:** Resource (useful item, ally, or info)
- **5:** Opportunity (shortcut, advantage, or lucky break)
- **6:** Twist (unexpected revelation that changes context)

**When to Use:**

- Searching a room
- Traveling through wilderness
- Investigating a mystery
- Exploring unknown areas

**Example:**

**You:** "I search the abandoned warehouse for clues about the smugglers."

**Discovery Roll:** 6 (Twist)

**Interpretation:** You find a ledger, but it's coded in a cipher you don't
recognize. Worse—the entries mention your employer's name. They're connected to
the smugglers. The mystery just got more complicated.

### Self-Sufficient Character Builds {#self-sufficient-character-builds}

Solo play rewards **generalist characters** who handle diverse challenges
without party support. Specialists excel in groups but struggle alone.

**Recommended Skill Spread:**

- **1 Combat Skill** (Melee or Ranged): Handle threats
- **1 Social Skill** (Persuasion, Deception, Insight): Negotiate and gather info
- **1 Investigation Skill** (Perception, Research): Find clues and solve puzzles
- **1 Technical/Survival Skill** (Security, Survival, Medicine): Handle
  practical challenges

**Avoid Narrow Specialization:**

If your only skills are combat-focused, non-combat scenes become frustrating. If
you specialize in social skills, solo combat becomes deadly. Spread your
capabilities across domains.

**Proficiencies for Solo Play:**

- **Self-Reliant:** Bonus to Survival, Medicine, or Crafting (handle injuries
  and gear maintenance)
- **Streetwise:** Access to contacts and information (replaces party
  information-gathering)
- **Combat Veteran:** Bonus in fights (no party backup means you need combat
  edge)
- **Quick Thinker:** Bonus to initiative or rerolls (act first, survive longer)

**Example Solo-Friendly Build:**

**Character:** Kade, the Wandering Investigator

**Skills:** Ranged Combat, Persuasion, Perception, Survival
**Proficiencies:** Streetwise (contacts), Self-Reliant (first aid), Quick
Thinker (initiative bonus)

**Why It Works:** Kade can fight at range (safer than melee), talk his way out
of trouble, investigate scenes, and survive wilderness travel. He's not the best
at any one thing, but he's competent across challenges common in solo play.

### Pacing and Clocks in Solo Play {#pacing-clocks-solo}

**Progress Clocks** track goals. **Pressure Clocks** track dangers. In solo
play, you set both clocks yourself based on narrative logic.

**Progress Clock Guidelines:**

- **Simple goals:** 4 segments (find a contact, investigate a scene)
- **Complex goals:** 6 segments (solve a mystery, infiltrate a stronghold)
- **Epic goals:** 8-10 segments (defeat a major antagonist, uncover conspiracy)

**Pressure Clock Guidelines:**

- **Immediate threats:** 4 segments (guards arrive, enemy closes in)
- **Long-term threats:** 6-8 segments (villain's plan unfolds, disease spreads)

**Tick Progress on Full Success, Pressure on Partial/Fail.**

**Example:**

**Goal:** Locate the hidden rebel base (Progress Clock: 0/6)

**Danger:** Inquisitors hunting you (Pressure Clock: 0/6)

**Scene 1:** You question a contact in the market. Roll Persuasion vs. DC 14.

**Roll:** 16 (Full Success)

**Result:** Progress ticks to 1/6. The contact gives you a lead—check the old
mill. Pressure doesn't tick.

**Scene 2:** You sneak to the mill. Roll Stealth vs. DC 15.

**Roll:** 13 (Partial Success)

**Result:** Progress ticks to 2/6 (you find evidence rebels were here), but
someone spots you leaving. Pressure ticks to 1/6 (inquisitors get a lead).

**Continue until Progress fills (success) or Pressure fills (failure/escape).**

### Solo Play Pitfalls {#solo-play-pitfalls}

**Over-Generous Oracles:** Don't roll oracle to confirm what you want. If you
want the door unlocked, that's wish fulfillment, not play. Roll oracle when the
answer genuinely matters and you don't know.

**Ignoring Consequences:** Don't erase failed rolls or complications. Embrace
setbacks—they create story tension. Solo play without failure becomes boring.

**Analysis Paralysis:** Don't overthink every decision. Set a timer (2 minutes)
for major choices. If you can't decide, roll a die and commit. Forward momentum
beats perfect planning.

**Lack of Surprise:** Use random tables liberally. If you pre-plan everything,
you're not playing—you're writing. Let tables surprise you. Embrace unexpected
results.

### Solo Play Example: Full Scene {#solo-play-example}

**Setup:** You're investigating a poisoning. Progress clock "Identify Culprit"
(0/4). Pressure clock "Assassin Escapes" (0/4).

**Scene 1—Crime Scene Investigation:**

**You:** "I search the victim's room for clues. Is anything obviously out of
place?"

**Oracle Roll (Weighted—Likely, with Advantage):** 5 (Yes)

**Interpretation:** You spot a shattered vial under the bed.

**Skill Check:** Roll Perception + RSN vs. DC 14.

**Roll:** 17 (Full Success)

**GM Hat:** Progress ticks to 1/4. The vial has a distinctive seal—House
Vyreth's apothecary.

**Scene 2—Tracking the Source:**

**You:** "I head to House Vyreth's apothecary. Are they open at this hour?"

**Oracle Roll:** 2 (No, but...)

**Interpretation:** Closed, but lights are on inside. Someone's there.

**You:** "I knock loudly and demand entry, showing my investigator's badge. Do
they let me in?"

**NPC Disposition Roll:** 3 (Cautious)

**NPC Goal Roll:** 2 (Safety)

**Interpretation:** They crack the door, nervous. "What do you want?" They're
scared, not hostile.

**Skill Check:** Roll Presence (intimidation) vs. DC 15.

**Roll:** 14 (Partial Success)

**GM Hat:** Progress ticks to 2/4 (they admit selling the poison), but they
panic and try to flee. Pressure ticks to 2/4 (assassin learns you're closing
in).

**Scene 3—Chasing the Lead:**

**You:** "I grab them before they bolt. Do they resist?"

**Oracle Roll:** 1 (No, and...)

**Interpretation:** They collapse, sobbing. "Lady Mirelle forced me! She'll kill
my family if I talk!"

**GM Hat:** Progress ticks to 3/4. You have the culprit's name. Pressure ticks
to 3/4 (Lady Mirelle knows you're hunting her—she's preparing to flee).

**Scene 4—Confrontation:**

**You:** "I rush to Lady Mirelle's estate. Is she still there?"

**Oracle Roll (Unlikely—Disadvantage):** 3 (Yes, but...)

**Interpretation:** She's there, but packing. You have minutes.

**Skill Check:** Roll AGI to sprint and intercept her before she escapes, DC 16.

**Roll:** 18 (Full Success)

**GM Hat:** Progress ticks to 4/4 (clock complete). You catch her at the door,
ledger in hand. Guards arrive. Case solved. Pressure clock stops at 3/4—you got
her just in time.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Oracles** determined world state (shop open? Lady Mirelle still there?)
- **Skill checks** determined your success at actions (intimidate, chase)
- **NPC tables** created unpredictable behavior (apothecary scared, not hostile)
- **Clocks** tracked dual pressures (progress vs. escape)
- **GM Hat** adjudicated outcomes fairly, embracing complications

Solo play works when you balance player goals with honest GMing. Don't cheat
yourself—embrace the unknown.

## Duet Play (1 GM + 1 Player) {#duet-play}

Duet play—one GM, one player—creates intimate, character-focused stories. With
only one PC, pacing shifts: downtime matters more, character development deepens,
and stakes feel personal. The system adapts easily, but GMs and players need to
adjust expectations.

### Character Design for Duet Play {#duet-character-design}

Without a party, your character needs broader capabilities:

**Generalist Over Specialist:** Like solo play, duet characters need
combat, social, and investigation skills. Pure specialists (all combat, no
social) struggle when challenges fall outside their domain.

**Virtual Player Characters (VPCs):** The GM might provide a recurring VPC—a
companion who travels with you. VPCs are loyal but less capable than full PCs.
They handle gaps in your skill set (you're a fighter, they're a healer; you're
a socialite, they're muscle). VPCs follow your lead but aren't replacements for
party dynamics. See GM Toolkit Chapter 09 for VPC creation guidance.

**Higher Power Level:** Some GMs boost starting attributes (+1 to all) or grant
extra proficiencies to compensate for lack of party support. Discuss with your
GM.

### Pacing Adjustments {#duet-pacing}

**Slower Advancement:** With one player, sessions focus deeply on your
character's arc. Advancement might trigger every 2-3 sessions instead of 3-4,
since individual spotlight time is concentrated.

**Shorter Combats:** Resolve clocks for enemies should be smaller (2-4 segments
instead of 4-6). Duet combat drags without party action economy, so fights
resolve faster.

**Emphasis on Relationships:** NPCs matter more. Your character's connections—
allies, rivals, mentors, enemies—drive the story. Invest in relationships; they
create narrative momentum.

**Lower Lethality:** One PC means no backup. GMs should telegraph danger clearly
and offer escape routes. Failure should complicate, not kill, unless stakes were
explicitly established.

### Duet Play Example {#duet-play-example}

**Setup:** You're a freelance investigator hired to find a missing scholar. Your
VPC companion, Marcus (loyal assistant, handles research and first aid), accompanies
you.

**Scene:** You arrive at the scholar's apartment. The door is ajar.

**GM:** "The apartment is dark. You hear movement inside—someone's searching the
place. Marcus whispers, 'Could be the scholar, or whoever took them.' What do
you do?"

**You:** "I signal Marcus to stay back and peek inside. Do I see who's
searching?"

**Skill Check:** Roll Perception + RSN vs. DC 13.

**Roll:** 15 (Full Success)

**GM:** "A cloaked figure rifles through papers. They pocket something—a letter.
You notice their belt: City Watch insignia. This isn't a burglar; it's a guard
covering something up."

**Key Differences from Group Play:**

- **Marcus (VPC)** provides backup but doesn't act independently—he follows your lead
- **Pacing is slower:** GM describes details because you're the only observer
- **Stakes are clear:** GM telegraphs danger (guard is armed, but unaware of you)
- **Choices matter more:** No party debate—your decision drives the scene

Duet play rewards deep character investment and tight GM-player collaboration.

## GM-less Play (Rotating Authority) {#gm-less-play}

GM-less play distributes GMing responsibilities across all players. One player
might frame a scene, another adjudicates a roll, a third portrays an NPC. This
mode requires trust, clear communication, and structured turn-taking to avoid
chaos.

### Authority Rotation Models {#authority-rotation}

**Scene Framing:** One player sets the scene ("We're in a tavern. A hooded
stranger approaches"). Others play their characters. Scene framer doesn't have
final say on outcomes—group consensus or dice decide.

**Round-Robin GMing:** Rotate GM duties each session or scene. Player A GMs
Scene 1, Player B GMs Scene 2, etc. The "current GM" adjudicates DCs, portrays
NPCs, and frames consequences. When it's your turn to GM, your PC takes a
backseat (VPC status—present but not in spotlight).

**Collaborative Adjudication:** When outcomes are uncertain, discuss as a group.
"Does the guard believe my lie?" Group votes or defers to dice (oracle roll).
Avoid arguing—set a 30-second timer for decisions.

### Tools for GM-less Play {#gm-less-tools}

**Oracle Rolls (Group Version):** Use solo play oracles (d6 yes/no tables) for
world questions. "Is the vault guarded?" Someone rolls, everyone interprets
together.

**Pre-Set DCs:** Before play, agree on DC ranges: Easy (10-12), Moderate (13-15),
Hard (16-18). When someone declares an action, the group agrees on difficulty
before rolling.

**NPC Behavior Tables:** Use solo play NPC disposition/goal tables. When a new
NPC appears, roll for disposition and goals. Whoever rolled portrays them for
that scene.

**Progress and Pressure Clocks:** Visible to everyone. Any player can suggest
ticking a clock; group consensus or GM-for-scene decides.

### GM-less Play Pitfalls {#gm-less-pitfalls}

**Lack of Narrative Drive:** Without a GM to push conflict, scenes stall. Assign
one player as "conflict advocate" each session—their job is to introduce
complications when things feel too easy.

**Player Favoritism:** Don't soft-adjudicate for yourself. If it's your turn to
GM and your PC attempts something risky, let someone else set the DC or
adjudicate the outcome.

**Analysis Paralysis:** Group decisions take time. Use timers (30 seconds for
minor choices, 2 minutes for major) to maintain momentum.

**Unbalanced Spotlight:** Track who's had focus. If one player dominates three
scenes, shift spotlight deliberately. "Let's frame a scene for [quieter player]."

### GM-less Example {#gm-less-example}

**Setup:** Three players (Alice, Bob, Clara) playing freelance mercenaries.
They're negotiating payment with a noble for a bodyguard job.

**Alice (Scene Framer):** "We're in the noble's manor. He's nervous—tapping his
fingers, glancing at the door. Bob, you're leading negotiations. What do you
say?"

**Bob:** "I lean forward. 'We've heard rumors about threats on your life. We're
the best, but the best costs. Five hundred gold, half upfront.'"

**Clara (Current GM):** "He hesitates. 'Three hundred. That's my limit.' This is
a negotiation contest. Roll Presence vs. his Presence. I'll roll for him. DC
15."

**Bob rolls:** 13 (Partial Success)

**Clara (GM):** "He agrees to four hundred but adds a condition: 'You stay until
the gala next week, not just tonight.' Pressure clock 'Noble's Enemies Act'
starts at 0/4. You just committed to a longer job."

**Key Differences:**

- **Alice framed** the scene but didn't GM it
- **Clara adjudicated** the roll and set consequences
- **Group decided** together that a pressure clock made sense
- **Bob accepted** the Partial outcome without arguing

GM-less play works when everyone commits to collaborative storytelling and fair
adjudication.

## Online Play {#online-play}

Playing over the internet using virtual tabletops (VTTs) or voice/video chat
requires adapting communication, tools, and pacing. The core mechanics stay the
same, but technical and social considerations shift.

### Platform Choices {#platform-choices}

**Voice/Video Only (Discord, Zoom):**

- **Pros:** Simple setup, no learning curve, flexible for theater-of-the-mind
  play
- **Cons:** No visual aids, harder to track initiative/clocks, relies on verbal
  description
- **Best For:** Low-prep games, investigation/social-heavy campaigns

**Virtual Tabletops (Roll20, Foundry VTT, Owlbear Rodeo):**

- **Pros:** Visual maps, token movement, integrated dice rollers, shared
  character sheets
- **Cons:** Setup time, learning curve, potential for technical issues
- **Best For:** Combat-heavy games, tactical play, groups that like visual
  reference

**Hybrid (Voice + Shared Docs):**

- **Pros:** Flexibility, shared clocks/notes in Google Docs, voice chat for
  play
- **Cons:** Requires discipline (everyone updates docs), no map visuals
- **Best For:** Medium crunch, investigation-focused play

### Communication Best Practices {#online-communication}

**Establish Speaking Order:** Without in-person body language, people talk over
each other. Use "speaking order" in tense scenes (GM calls on players) or
"raise hand" features in video tools.

**State Intent Clearly:** "I want to sneak past the guard using the shadows" is
clearer than "I roll Stealth" in text-only environments. Typing intent before
rolling prevents confusion.

**Use Shared Resources:** Post progress/pressure clocks in shared docs or VTT
notes so everyone sees current state. This prevents "wait, how many segments are
filled?" questions.

**Camera Usage:** Video isn't mandatory but helps. Seeing faces improves
engagement and lets the GM read reactions. If someone's camera-shy, that's
fine—voice-only works.

**Break More Often:** Online fatigue is real. Take 10-minute breaks every 90
minutes, not just at the 2-hour mark. Stretch, hydrate, rest eyes.

### Technical Considerations {#online-technical}

**Dice Rolling:** Use VTT built-in rollers, Discord bots (Avrae, Sidekick), or
honor-system self-rolls. Trust your group unless you've had problems.

**Latency and Lag:** If someone has poor internet, simplify visual assets (fewer
high-res maps, lighter VTT scenes). Consider text-first play for critical scenes
if lag is severe.

**Session Zero for Tools:** Test your VTT or voice platform in Session Zero.
Make sure everyone can connect, roll dice, and hear each other. Fix issues
before play starts.

**Backup Plans:** Have a secondary communication method (Discord backup if Zoom
fails). Save VTT sessions frequently to avoid data loss.

### Pacing Adjustments {#online-pacing}

**Shorter Sessions:** 2-3 hours works better online than 4-hour marathons.
Fatigue hits faster without in-person energy.

**Clearer Scene Transitions:** "We're moving to a new scene—you're now at the
docks" is more necessary online. Without physical presence, players miss GM body
language signaling transitions.

**Visual Aids:** Use images (Pinterest, AI-generated art, reference photos) for
NPCs, locations, or key items. Drop them in chat. Online play lacks in-person
gestures; images compensate.

**Explicit Recaps:** Start each session with a 2-minute recap of last session's
events. Memory fades more online—nobody sees your GM notes between sessions.

### Online-Specific Pitfalls {#online-pitfalls}

**Multitasking Players:** It's tempting to browse, text, or game during online
sessions. Establish norms: phones down, no alt-tabbing during play (or at least
minimize it).

**Mic Discipline:** Mute when not speaking (background noise is distracting). Use
push-to-talk if your environment is loud.

**Tech Troubleshooting Mid-Session:** If someone can't connect, don't halt play
for 20 minutes. Give them 5 minutes to rejoin; if they can't, narrate their PC
as "busy with another task" and loop them in later.

**Lack of Social Energy:** Online play can feel flat. Compensate with music,
ambient sound (rain, tavern noise), and enthusiastic GMing. Energy doesn't
translate automatically through screens—you have to project it.

### Online Play Example {#online-play-example}

**Setup:** Four players on Roll20 with Discord voice. GM shares a city map and
places tokens.

**GM (in Discord):** "You're outside the warehouse. Rain is pouring—Disadvantage
to Perception checks. I've placed your tokens. Mira, what do you do?"

**Mira (typing in Roll20 chat):** "I move to the side door and check if it's
locked."

**GM:** "Roll Security. DC 14."

**Mira (using Roll20 dice roller):** [Rolls 16] "Got it. 16 total."

**GM:** "The lock clicks open. You're in. The warehouse is dark—three crates in
the center, a figure moving in the back. Everyone roll Initiative."

**GM (sharing an image in Discord):** [Posts reference image of a shadowy
warehouse interior]

**Key Differences:**

- **Typed intent** (Mira in chat) clarifies actions
- **Shared map** shows positions visually
- **Integrated rolls** (Roll20 roller) keep dice transparent
- **Visual aids** (warehouse image) enhance immersion
- **Clear narration** (GM describes explicitly, no body language cues)

Online play requires intentional communication and technical fluency, but the
game itself remains unchanged.
