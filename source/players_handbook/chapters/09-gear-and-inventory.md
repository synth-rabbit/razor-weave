# Equipment, Gear, and Inventory {#ph-equipment-gear-and-inventory}



## Gear Philosophy {#gear-philosophy}

Gear in this system represents **narrative permission and fictional
positioning**, not exhaustive simulation. A lockpick set lets you attempt
picking locks. Climbing gear makes scaling walls feasible. A medkit allows
first aid.

The GM tracks realism through fiction, not item weights or durability trackers.
If you have rope, you can use it. If you run out, the GM will tell you.

## Core Equipment Categories {#core-equipment-categories}

**Weapons:** Define your approach in combat. Blades for close quarters, bows
for range, improvised tools for desperation. Mechanically similar; narratively
distinct.

**Armor:** Provides protection. Heavy armor might grant Advantage to defense
but impose Disadvantage on stealth. Light armor keeps you mobile. Narratively,
armor shapes how you're perceived.

**Tools:** Professional equipment that grants narrative access. Thieves' tools,
medical kits, arcane focuses, hacking rigs. Without the tool, you can't attempt
the action (or face Disadvantage).

**Resources:** Narrative assets like contacts, favors, safe houses, or
information. Spend them to gain Advantage, skip challenges, or unlock options.

## Inventory Management {#inventory-management}

This system avoids micromanagement. Use one of these approaches:

**Slots:** Carry X significant items (typically 5–10). Small items don't count.
Narratively reasonable.

**Narrative Limits:** If it makes sense that you have it, you do. If the GM
questions it, justify or accept you don't have it.

**GM Discretion:** The GM tracks what's plausible. If you're fleeing through
sewers, you probably don't have your full kit.

Choose the method that fits your table's preferences.

## When Gear Matters {#when-gear-matters}

Gear creates **Advantage** or **narrative access**:

- Climbing gear grants Advantage on scaling cliffs.
- A disguise kit enables infiltration attempts.
- A medkit lets you stabilize *Bleeding* conditions.
- A contact in the docks gives you access to smugglers.

Gear matters when it changes what's possible or shifts your odds. The GM calls
for specific gear when fiction demands it.

## Worked Example {#worked-example}

**Situation:** Marcus (the burned intelligence analyst from Chapter 16) needs
to infiltrate a corporate server room to retrieve encrypted files.

**Gear Check:** Marcus has his laptop (encrypted), fake IDs, and burner phones.
The GM asks: "Do you have anything that helps with physical security?"

Marcus's player: "I have lockpick tools in my kit—picked them up after the safe
house job."

**GM:** "Good. The server room door has a standard lock. With your *Urban
Investigation* skill and lockpicks, you have Advantage. Roll RSN + skill."

**Result:** Gear (lockpicks) granted narrative access (attempting the lock) and
mechanical advantage (Advantage on the roll). Without the tools, Marcus would
face Disadvantage or couldn't attempt it at all.

**Narrative Limit Example:** Later, the GM asks if Marcus has a grappling hook
to scale the building. Marcus's player: "I don't think I'd have that—I've been
traveling light since fleeing the city." The GM agrees. Fiction determines
plausibility.

## Genre-Specific Gear Examples {#genre-specific-gear-examples}

## Gear Upgrades and Advancement {#gear-upgrades-and-advancement}

As campaigns progress, gear improves:

### Tier 1 (Starting)—Basic Gear {#tier-1-starting-basic-gear}

**Function:** Narrative permission. You have what you need to attempt actions.

**Examples:** Standard weapons, basic tools, mundane armor, a few contacts.

**Mechanical Effect:** Advantage when gear applies. No special bonuses.

### Tier 2 (Mid-Campaign)—Specialized Gear {#tier-2-mid-campaign-specialized-gear}

**Function:** Enhanced capabilities. Gear grants additional benefits or covers
edge cases.

**Examples:** Masterwork weapons (+1 to strikes), advanced tools (hacking rig
with AI assist), reinforced armor (grants *Solid Cover* when stationary),
influential contacts.

**Mechanical Effect:** Advantage plus occasional narrative bonus (bypass minor
obstacles, reduce complications).

**How to Acquire:** Loot, downtime crafting (see Chapter 10), faction rewards,
purchase with significant resources.

### Tier 3 (Late Campaign)—Legendary Gear {#tier-3-late-campaign-legendary-gear}

**Function:** Game-changing capabilities. Gear opens new tactical options or
solves problems outright.

**Examples:** Enchanted blade (ignores armor), cloaking device (invisible in
darkness), AI-guided weapon (auto-target), high-level political ally (mobilize
resources).

**Mechanical Effect:** Advantage, narrative bonuses, and occasional automatic
success on appropriate checks.

**How to Acquire:** Campaign rewards, major quest completion, legendary crafting
projects, powerful faction membership.

## Resource Spending and Leverage {#resource-spending-and-leverage}

Resources are narrative advantages you spend for effect:

### Contacts and Favors {#contacts-and-favors}

**What They Do:** Contacts provide information, access, or assistance.

**When to Spend:** When stuck on investigation, need entry to restricted areas,
or require backup.

**Example:**

**You:** "I call Detective Reyes—he owes me a favor from the docks case. Can he
get me into the precinct evidence locker?"

**GM:** "Yes, but this burns the favor. He'll let you in after hours, but you're
on your own if caught."

**You:** "Worth it. I need that file."

### Safe Houses and Refuges {#safe-houses-and-refuges}

**What They Do:** Temporary havens where you can rest, plan, or hide from pursuit.

**When to Use:** When heat is on, you need downtime, or you need secure location
for planning.

**Example:**

**GM:** "Corporate security is sweeping the district. Pressure clock ticks to 3/4."

**You:** "I head to the safe house—the old warehouse on Pier 7. We lie low until
the sweep passes."

**GM:** "Safe. You can rest here. Clear *Exhausted* condition and plan next move."

### Information and Secrets {#information-and-secrets}

**What They Do:** Leverage for negotiation, blackmail, or bypassing obstacles.

**When to Spend:** When negotiating from weak position, need to force cooperation,
or bypass gatekeepers.

**Example:**

**GM:** "The crime boss laughs. 'Why would I tell you anything?'"

**You:** "I slide a datastick across the table. 'Because I have evidence of your
deal with the feds. Cooperate, and this disappears.'"

**GM:** "Roll Persuasion with Advantage—you have serious leverage."

## Narrative Inventory Troubleshooting {#narrative-inventory-troubleshooting}

### Common Questions {#common-questions}

**"Can I have X?"**

- **If it fits your concept and backstory:** Probably yes.
- **If it's expensive or rare:** Requires justification (downtime purchase,
  loot, favor).
- **If it's implausible:** No. Explain why it doesn't fit.

**"Do I run out of ammo/supplies?"**

- **Normal usage:** No tracking. Assume you restock during downtime.
- **Extended missions without resupply:** GM might call for resource checks or
  introduce scarcity as pressure.
- **Narrative scarcity:** If fleeing through wilderness or trapped, the GM might
  say "You're low on supplies—what do you prioritize?"

**"Can I upgrade my gear?"**

- **Downtime crafting:** Use Chapter 10 downtime rules to craft or upgrade.
- **Loot:** Acquire better gear from defeated enemies or discovered caches.
- **Purchase:** Spend resources (money, favors) during downtime to buy upgrades.

**"I want gear that gives me a bonus."**

- **Narrative permission:** Gear grants narrative access (lockpicks let you pick
  locks) and Advantage when relevant.
- **Mechanical bonuses:** Mid-to-late campaign gear might grant +1 or special
  abilities. Talk to your GM about progression.
