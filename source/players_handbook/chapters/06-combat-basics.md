# Combat Basics {#ph-combat-basics}

## Combat Overview {#combat-overview}

Combat starts when violence erupts and everyone's choices matter moment to
moment. The GM calls for initiative when the fiction demands it—usually when
surprise breaks, threats emerge, or negotiation fails. Combat uses the same
core mechanics you know (DCs, outcome tiers, tags, clocks), but with tighter
focus on positioning, immediate danger, and tactical choices.

### No Hit Points: Resolve and Clocks {#resolve-and-clocks}

This system doesn't track hit points. Instead, the GM uses **resolve clocks**
and **conditions** to represent how much punishment characters and enemies can
take before they're taken out of the fight.

**Resolve Clocks** are segmented progress trackers (typically 4-6 segments for
enemies, more for major threats). When you land a successful Strike or create
pressure, the GM ticks segments on the enemy's resolve clock. When the clock
fills completely, they're out—unconscious, fleeing, surrendering, or dead,
depending on the fiction.

**Why Clocks Instead of HP?**

- **Fiction-First**: Characters are "taken out" when it makes narrative sense,
  not at an arbitrary number. A skilled duelist might fold after 4 solid hits,
  while a raging beast takes 8.
- **Visible Progress**: You see the clock filling and know you're wearing them
  down. No hidden HP pools—the GM describes their state ("staggering,"
  "defensive," "desperate") as segments fill.
- **Flexible Stakes**: The GM can adjust clock size on the fly based on pacing.
  Minor enemies get smaller clocks (2-3 segments), major bosses get larger ones
  (6-8 segments).

**What You Do**: Focus on the fiction. Describe your attacks and tactics. The
GM handles the clock math behind the screen. When you land hits or create
pressure, you'll see progress. When the clock fills, they're done.

**Your Resolve**: The GM tracks your resolve similarly. Taking damage, failing
checks, or suffering consequences ticks your resolve. When your clock fills,
you're taken out—you might be unconscious, captured, or forced to retreat. The
GM will warn you when you're in danger ("You're hurt bad—two more solid hits
and you're out"). Use Defend/Withdraw to reset position and buy time to
recover.

## Order & Your Turn {#order--your-turn}

The GM picks an ordering mode based on the scene:

**Conversational:** The GM asks "Who acts?" and rotates spotlight. Natural
for small skirmishes or when surprise isn't a factor.

**Popcorn:** You act, then name who goes next (alternate sides). Prevents
one side from dominating. The GM might say: "You're up, then pick who acts
next."

On your turn, you describe your action (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up,
Defend/Withdraw), the GM sets the DC and pre-states outcomes, you roll, and
the GM narrates the result. Then the next person acts.

## Core Actions {#core-actions}

**Strike:** Attack an opponent. Roll contest or passive DC. On Full, deal
damage or apply pressure. On Partial, connect but take a cost (exposed,
pressure ticks). On Fail, they counter or you lose position.

*Tactical Notes:* Strike is your most direct option but not always optimal.
Against tough enemies (high DC), consider Set Up first to create Advantage,
then Strike with better odds. Against multiple weaker foes, Strike to eliminate
threats fast. Partial Success on Strike often means trading blows—viable if
you're tougher than they are, risky if you're already wounded.

**Maneuver:** Shove, trip, disarm, reposition. On Full, achieve your goal
(they're prone, disarmed, moved). On Partial, trade something (you go prone
too, lose grip). Use to create openings or control space.

*Tactical Notes:* Maneuver shines when positioning matters more than damage.
Shove an enemy off high ground (removing their Advantage). Trip a charging
brute (apply *Prone*, making them vulnerable). Disarm a gunman in close
quarters (forcing them to draw a backup weapon or flee). Maneuver changes the
battlefield—use it when the situation needs changing, not when you just need to
hurt someone.

**Set Up:** Create advantage for yourself or allies—cover fire, feint, flank.
On Full, grant Advantage or apply a helpful tag. On Partial, create advantage
but expose yourself or tick pressure.

*Tactical Notes:* Set Up is the team player's action. Flanking an enemy grants
Advantage to everyone attacking them. Suppressing fire pins down a sniper while
allies advance. Feinting draws attention, letting your Rogue slip behind for a
backstab. Set Up sacrifices your immediate impact for greater team efficiency.
Best used when: (1) your Strike would be low odds, (2) an ally can capitalize
better than you, or (3) you need to control enemy actions without committing to
combat.

**Defend/Withdraw:** Change position to safety, clear a condition, or break
contact. On Full, reposition cleanly and clear a minor tag (Suppressed,
Exposed). On Partial, move but give up your next action. Use when you need
breathing room.

*Tactical Notes:* Defend/Withdraw is not cowardice—it's smart positioning.
Retreat to cover when you're Exposed. Fall back to force enemies through a
chokepoint. Clear *Suppressed* so you can act freely next round.

**Design Philosophy: Why Action Economy Matters**

Combat limits you to **one action per turn** for a crucial design reason: **meaningful choices under pressure**. If you could Strike AND Maneuver AND Set Up every turn, combat would become a rote optimization puzzle—"do all the best things in sequence." Limiting actions forces you to prioritize: *What matters most right now?*

This creates **tactical tension**. Do you Strike the wounded enemy to finish them, or Set Up to help your ally against the bigger threat? Do you Maneuver to high ground for long-term advantage, or Strike while you have the opening? Every choice means sacrificing alternatives.

Action economy also balances numerical advantage. Three enemies don't just have more total capabilities—they get **three actions per round** to your one. This makes outnumbering dangerous and forces players to use terrain, positioning, and coordination to offset numerical disadvantage. It's not "you're outnumbered so you lose"—it's "you're outnumbered, so you need to be smarter."

From a pacing perspective, limiting actions keeps combat dynamic. Fights resolve in 3-6 rounds typically, not 10+ slugfests. Each round matters because you can only do one thing. There's no downtime between significant choices—every turn is a decision point.

**In tactical terms**: Action economy favors **efficiency**. Eliminate threats fast (Strike). Create lasting advantages (Maneuver/Set Up). Don't waste turns on low-impact actions when the clock is ticking. Your action is your most valuable resource each round—spend it wisely.

If you're
outnumbered or wounded, resetting position is more valuable than one more
desperate Strike. Know when to disengage and live to fight another round.

### Example: Combat Action Synergy {#example-combat-synergy}

**Scenario**: Three adventurers face two bandits in a warehouse. Kaela
(ranger) has elevation on a catwalk, Marcus (fighter) is in melee with one
bandit, and Ryn (rogue) is flanking distance away. The second bandit has
solid cover behind crates.

**Round 1**: Kaela uses **Set Up** (suppressing fire) against the covered
bandit. Full Success—GM applies *Suppressed* tag, the bandit can't leave
cover without penalty. Ryn uses the opening to **Maneuver** (sprint to flank
Marcus's target). Full Success—now Marcus's enemy is flanked. Marcus
**Strikes** with Advantage (flanked enemy). Full Success—2 segments filled on
enemy's 4-segment clock.

**Round 2**: The flanked bandit tries to **Defend/Withdraw** (break from
Marcus). Partial Success—he backs away but is *Exposed*. The suppressed
bandit **Strikes** Kaela from cover. Partial—Kaela takes 1 tick resolve but
keeps elevation. Kaela **Strikes** the exposed bandit with Advantage. Full
Success—2 more segments, clock fills, enemy unconscious. Ryn **Strikes** the
remaining bandit while still suppressed. Full Success—2 segments. Marcus
**Maneuvers** (advances on suppressed enemy, shields up).

**Round 3**: The last bandit, half-depleted and trapped, surrenders.

**Key Takeaways**: Set Up created advantage that cascaded through multiple
turns. Flanking amplified damage efficiency. Defend/Withdraw worked but left
the enemy vulnerable. Team coordination (Set Up → Maneuver → Strike) defeated
enemies faster than three uncoordinated Strikes would have.

## Using Terrain & Tags {#using-terrain--tags}

Environmental tags shape your options:

**Cover (Fragile vs Solid):** Fragile (crates, thin walls) grants Advantage
but degrades on Partial. Solid (stone, thick barriers) is reliable. Use Set
Up to create or improve cover.

**Elevation:** High ground grants Advantage on ranged attacks and forces
opponents to climb to reach you.

**Dim/Obscuring Light:** Hinders vision. Grants Disadvantage to ranged
attacks but Advantage to stealth. Use to slip away or reposition.

**Cramped/Slick Terrain:** Cramped spaces make movement risky. Slick surfaces
impose Disadvantage on maneuvers. The GM names tags; you decide how to use or
avoid them.

### Common Combat Tags At-a-Glance {#common-combat-tags}

These tags appear frequently in combat. Understanding their effects helps you
make quick tactical decisions.

**Cover Tags:**

- **Fragile Cover** (wooden crates, thin walls): Grants +1 Advantage on defense
  checks. Degrades on Partial Success (becomes no cover). Can be destroyed by
  focused attacks or environmental effects.
- **Solid Cover** (stone walls, thick barriers): Grants +1 Advantage on defense
  checks. Does not degrade. Can only be removed by extreme force or
  repositioning.

**Positioning Tags:**

- **Elevated** (high ground, rooftop, platform): Grants +1 Advantage on ranged
  attacks against lower targets. Forces opponents to climb (DC 14 Maneuver) to
  reach you, exposing them during ascent.
- **Flanked** (surrounded, caught between enemies): Grants +1 Advantage to
  attackers positioned on opposite sides. Created by coordinated Set Up actions.
- **Exposed** (caught in open, off-balance): Grants +1 Disadvantage on defense
  checks. Applied by Partial Success costs or failed positioning. Cleared by
  Defend/Withdraw or reaching cover.

**Environmental Tags:**

- **Dim Light** (shadows, fog, smoke): Grants +1 Disadvantage to ranged attacks
  and perception checks. Grants +1 Advantage to stealth and evasion. Can be
  created (smoke grenades, kick up dust) or used (existing conditions).
- **Cramped** (narrow corridor, dense forest): Restricts movement and weapon
  use. Larger weapons (two-handed, polearms) may suffer +1 Disadvantage.
  Grappling and close-quarters attacks gain +1 Advantage.
- **Slick** (oil, ice, wet stone): Grants +1 Disadvantage on Maneuver checks
  (shove, trip, reposition). Failed checks result in *Prone* condition. Can be
  created intentionally (spill oil, freeze water).

**Condition Tags:**

- **Prone** (knocked down, fallen): Grants +1 Disadvantage on defense and attack
  checks. Standing costs your action. Ranged attackers shooting at prone targets
  suffer +1 Disadvantage (harder to hit low targets).
- **Suppressed** (pinned by fire, intimidated): Grants +1 Disadvantage on
  offensive actions. Created by Set Up actions (covering fire, threatening
  presence). Cleared by breaking line of sight or eliminating the suppressor.
- **Stunned** (dazed, off-balance): Skip next action entirely. Applied by
  critical effects (flash grenades, head trauma, falling damage). Severe penalty
  requiring time or aid to clear.

**Using Tags Tactically:**

- **Create advantage:** Use Set Up to apply beneficial tags (*Flanked*,
  *Suppressed*) to enemies or environment (*Slick*, *Dim Light*).
- **Deny enemy advantage:** Use Maneuver to remove their cover or reposition
  away from *Flanked* situations.
- **Stack effects:** Combine tags for multiple sources of Advantage (e.g.,
  *Elevated* + *Flanked* = +2 Advantage).

## Damage & Resolve {#damage--resolve}

As explained in [Combat Overview](#resolve-and-clocks), the GM tracks damage
using resolve clocks rather than hit points. This section focuses on
**conditions**—persistent states that impose penalties until cleared.

**Conditions** represent lasting effects from combat: injury, exhaustion, or
impairment. Unlike resolve clock progress (which the GM tracks), conditions are
visible to everyone and impose mechanical penalties.

**Common Combat Conditions:**

- **Bleeding** (injury, open wound): Take 1 pressure at the start of each round
  until stabilized. Cleared by first aid (DC 14 check) or magical healing.
  Multiple bleeding wounds stack—each ticks pressure separately.

- **Exhausted** (fatigue, overexertion): Suffer -1 Disadvantage on physical
  checks (Strength, Agility). Cleared by rest (short rest clears 1 level, long
  rest clears all). Exhaustion stacks—multiple levels impose cumulative
  penalties.

- **Stunned** (dazed, disoriented): Skip your next action entirely. Applied by
  critical effects (head trauma, flash grenades, sonic attacks). Cleared
  automatically after 1 round or by ally assistance (DC 14 check).

**Clearing Conditions**: Conditions require specific actions to clear. The GM
will tell you what's needed—first aid for Bleeding, rest for Exhausted, time or
assistance for Stunned. Multiple conditions stack, making continued fighting
dangerous. If you're Bleeding and Exhausted, you're ticking pressure every
round AND rolling with Disadvantage. Use Defend/Withdraw to break contact and
get help.

**Fiction vs Mechanics**: The GM describes your state based on resolve clock
progress and conditions. "You're staggering, bleeding from a gash on your arm
(Bleeding), and you can barely keep your sword up (Exhausted)." Focus on the
fiction—the mechanics support the narrative, not the other way around.

## Worked Example {#worked-example}

**Scene:** You're in an alley (*Dim Light*, *Cramped*). Two thugs block the
exit. You're behind *Fragile Cover* (stacked crates).

**Turn 1 (You):**

**You:** "I use Set Up—I'm laying down cover fire to pin the front thug."

**GM:** "DC 14. Full means you Suppress him (Disadvantage on his next
action). Partial means you Suppress him but degrade your Fragile cover. Roll
Agility."

**You roll 16—Full.**

**GM:** "You fire twice, forcing him to duck. He's Suppressed. Next?"

**Turn 2 (Thug):**

**GM:** "The Suppressed thug tries to advance anyway. He rolls with
Disadvantage—fails. He stays pinned. The second thug circles left, trying to
flank you. DC 16 to intercept with a Maneuver."

**You roll 14—Fail.**

**GM:** "He closes the gap. He's next to you now—your cover's useless at this
range. You lose Advantage, and he's in position to Strike."

**Turn 3 (You):**

**You:** "I use Defend/Withdraw—I shove past him and fall back to the solid
wall at the alley mouth."

**GM:** "DC 14. Full means you break clean. Partial means you get there but
he grabs your coat—pressure ticks. Roll Strength or Agility."

**You roll 17—Full.**

**GM:** "You twist free and sprint back. You're at the wall, solid cover, and
both thugs have to cross open ground to reach you. What now?"

The example shows Set Up creating advantage, a failed Maneuver costing
position, and Defend/Withdraw resetting the scene. Tags (Dim, Cramped,
Fragile/Solid cover) shaped every choice.

## Advanced Combat Scenarios {#advanced-combat-scenarios}

These scenarios demonstrate tactical depth: multi-round positioning, using
terrain creatively, and handling multiple opponents. Each shows both competent
play (achieving goals) and optimization opportunities (maximizing efficiency).

### Scenario 1: Rooftop Standoff (Multi-Round Tactical Play) {#rooftop-standoff}

**Setup:** You and two allies face three guards on a flat rooftop. Crates
(*Fragile Cover*) are scattered. The roof edge is 20 feet away (*Fall Risk*).

**Round 1—Establishing Position:**

**Ally 1 (Ranger):** "I use Set Up—moving to flank the left guard."

**GM:** "DC 14. Full means you get there and grant Advantage to anyone
attacking him. Partial means you expose yourself getting there—you're
*Exposed* (Disadvantage on defense). Roll Agility."

**Ally 1 rolls 18—Full.**

**GM:** "You circle wide. Anyone attacking that guard has Advantage now."

**Guard 1:** "I Strike the Ranger with my crossbow."

**GM (rolling for guard):** "He rolls 12 vs your DC 14—Fail. The bolt goes
wide. You're safe."

**You (Fighter):** "I Strike the center guard while he's reloading."

**GM:** "DC 16—he's alert. Full deals 2 pressure, Partial 1 pressure but you're
*Exposed*. Roll Strength."

**You roll 19—Full.**

**GM:** "You land a solid hit. He staggers back, 2 pressure. His clock is half
full now."

**Round 2—Pressing the Advantage:**

**Ally 2 (Rogue):** "I Strike the left guard—the one who's flanked."

**GM:** "You have Advantage from the Ranger's flank. DC 14. Full is 2 pressure,
Partial 1 pressure and you're *Exposed*."

**Ally 2 rolls 21 (with Advantage)—Full.**

**GM:** "Your blade finds the gap. He drops—out of the fight. Two guards left."

**Guard 2 (center):** "I use Defend/Withdraw—falling back to *Solid Cover*
behind the rooftop door housing."

**GM:** "He breaks contact cleanly. He's behind solid cover now—you'll need to
close or flush him out."

**You:** "I advance on him, using Maneuver to kick the crates in his way."

**GM:** "DC 16—you're trying to deny his cover. Full means you scatter the
crates and he loses cover. Partial means you move them but expose yourself."

**You roll 15—Partial.**

**GM:** "You kick the crates aside, but he fires as you move. You're *Exposed*
and take 1 pressure."

**Round 3—Finishing the Fight:**

**Ally 1 (Ranger):** "I use Set Up—covering fire on the last guard to pin him."

**GM:** "DC 14. Full *Suppresses* him (Disadvantage). Partial Suppresses him
but you're out of arrows after this."

**Ally 1 rolls 17—Full.**

**GM:** "Your arrows force him flat. He's *Suppressed*."

**You:** "I rush him while he's pinned—Strike with my sword."

**GM:** "He's *Suppressed* so you have Advantage. DC 14. Full drops him, Partial
deals 2 pressure."

**You roll 18 (with Advantage)—Full.**

**GM:** "You close fast and strike hard. He goes down. Fight's over."

**Tactical Breakdown:**

- **Round 1:** Positioning mattered. Flanking created Advantage, aggressive
  Strike built pressure.
- **Round 2:** Used Advantage immediately (Rogue's Strike). Guard adapted by
  retreating to better cover. Fighter pressed but paid a cost (Exposed).
- **Round 3:** Combined Set Up (Suppress) with Strike to finish efficiently.

**Optimization Notes:** Ally 2 could have used Set Up in Round 1 to create
*even more* Advantage for Round 2, but the aggressive Strike ended the threat
faster. Both approaches work—it depends on your risk tolerance.

### Scenario 2: The High Ground (Elevation & Positioning) {#high-ground}

**Setup:** You're on a stone platform (*Elevated*, *Solid Cover*). Two archers
are below in the courtyard (*Open Ground*). One tries to climb up.

**Turn 1 (You):**

**You:** "I Strike the climber with my bow while he's exposed on the ladder."

**GM:** "You have Advantage (Elevation + he's climbing). DC 12. Full deals 2
pressure and knocks him off. Partial deals 1 pressure but he keeps climbing."

**You roll 19 (with Advantage)—Full.**

**GM:** "Your arrow catches him in the shoulder. He loses grip and falls 10
feet—he's *Stunned* and takes 2 pressure. He's out for a round."

**Turn 2 (Archer 1):**

**GM:** "The other archer shoots at you from below. He has Disadvantage
(Elevation + your Solid Cover). He rolls 10 vs your DC 14—Fail. His arrow
clatters off the stone."

**Turn 3 (You):**

**You:** "I Strike the standing archer."

**GM:** "Advantage from Elevation. DC 14. Full is 2 pressure, Partial 1
pressure."

**You roll 16 (with Advantage)—Full.**

**GM:** "Clean hit. He's hurt bad—2 pressure, clock nearly full."

**Turn 4 (Archer 1):**

**GM:** "He uses Defend/Withdraw—running for the archway (*Solid Cover*). DC 14
to intercept with a shot."

**You roll 12—Fail.**

**GM:** "He makes it. He's behind cover now, and the climber is getting up."

**Tactical Breakdown:**

- **Elevation** gave consistent Advantage, making every shot easier.
- **Solid Cover** protected you from return fire (enemy Disadvantage).
- **Falling damage** (from knocking climber off) turned one threat into a
  non-factor for multiple rounds.
- **Positioning** let you control the fight—they had to come to you, and doing
  so exposed them.

**Optimization Notes:** You could have used Set Up on Turn 3 to *Suppress* the
archer (preventing his retreat) instead of dealing damage. That's the tradeoff:
immediate pressure vs denying enemy actions.

### Scenario 3: Outnumbered (Three vs One) {#outnumbered}

**Setup:** You're alone in a workshop. Three thugs close in. The room has
*Cramped* spaces (workbenches), a *Slick* oil spill, and a door (*Exit*) 15
feet away.

**Turn 1 (You):**

**You:** "I use Set Up—kicking over the lantern to spread fire and create
chaos."

**GM:** "DC 14. Full creates *Burning* terrain (Disadvantage to anyone crossing
it, 1 pressure per round if you stay). Partial creates *Smoke* (obscures
vision, Disadvantage to ranged). Roll Agility."

**You roll 16—Full.**

**GM:** "The oil ignites. There's a wall of fire between you and two of them
now. They'll have to go around or risk crossing. The third thug is on your side
of the fire."

**Turn 2 (Thug 1, on your side):**

**GM:** "He rushes you—Strike with a club. You're in *Cramped* terrain. He
rolls 15 vs your DC 14—Partial Success for him."

**GM:** "He swings wild, connects but stumbles into a workbench. You both take
1 pressure."

**Turn 3 (You):**

**You:** "I use Maneuver—shove him into the *Slick* oil spill."

**GM:** "DC 14. Full knocks him *Prone* in the oil (Disadvantage on his next
action). Partial moves him there but you lose balance—*Exposed*."

**You roll 17—Full.**

**GM:** "You heave him backward. He goes down hard in the slick, struggling to
stand. He's *Prone*."

**Turn 4 (Thug 2 & 3, across fire):**

**GM:** "One tries to circle left around the fire. The other tries to leap it.
Leaping is DC 16 or he takes 2 pressure and ends *Prone* on your side."

**GM (rolling for Thug 3):** "He rolls 13—Fail. He stumbles into the flames,
takes 2 pressure, and lands *Prone* at your feet. Thug 2 is still circling."

**Turn 5 (You):**

**You:** "I use Defend/Withdraw—I sprint for the door and bolt it behind me."

**GM:** "DC 14. Full means you get out clean. Partial means you get out but one
follows you through."

**You roll 18—Full.**

**GM:** "You're out, door slammed and barred. They're trapped in a burning
room. You win."

**Tactical Breakdown:**

- **Set Up** (creating *Burning* terrain) split the enemies, turning 3v1 into
  1v1 temporarily.
- **Maneuver** (shove into *Slick* terrain) neutralized the immediate threat
  (*Prone* = Disadvantage).
- **Defend/Withdraw** (escape) was the win condition—you didn't need to fight,
  just survive and leave.
- **Environmental tags** (*Cramped*, *Slick*, *Burning*) were more effective
  than direct combat.

**Optimization Notes:** You could have used Strike to finish Thug 1 while he
was *Prone*, but escaping was safer and faster. Against overwhelming odds,
changing the situation (environment, escape) beats standing and fighting.
