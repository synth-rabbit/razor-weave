# Chapter 05: PC Templates and Kits {#chapter-05}

Templates are plug-and-play mechanical bundles designed for fast, effective character creation. Each template combines skills, proficiencies, and starting gear into a coherent package focused on a specific play style—combat, social interaction, technical expertise, or exploration. Templates work across genres with minor adaptations, providing flexible foundations for any setting.

This chapter provides 12 templates organized by focus area. Each template includes skills, proficiencies, starting gear, genre variants, and example characters. Use templates when you need a mechanically sound character quickly, or mix elements from multiple templates to create hybrid builds.

For skills and proficiencies, see Mechanics Reference Guide Chapters 06-17. For archetypes organized by genre, see Chapter 04. For backstory development, see Chapter 06.

## How to Use Templates {#how-to-use}

Templates serve two purposes:

**Complete Packages**: Choose a template, note the skills and proficiencies, select starting gear, and begin play. The template provides everything needed for mechanical competence.

**Mix-and-Match Components**: Select skills from one template, proficiencies from another, and gear from a third. Templates are modular—use them as building blocks rather than rigid frameworks.

**Genre Adaptation**: Each template includes genre variants showing how to adjust skills and gear for different settings. A Frontline Fighter in Fantasy becomes a Marine in Sci-Fi with minimal changes.

**Customization**: Swap one or two skills to reflect character backstory or unique talents. Adjust proficiencies to match campaign needs. Templates provide structure, not limitation.
