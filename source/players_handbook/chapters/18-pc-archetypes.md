# Chapter 04: PC Archetypes by Genre {#chapter-04}

Player characters are the heart of every story. Whether baking bread in a cozy village, wielding swords in ancient ruins, investigating supernatural horrors, navigating corporate intrigue, or piloting starships across galaxies, PCs need clear identities that feel both mechanically coherent and narratively rich.

This chapter provides ready-to-use archetypes organized by genre. Each archetype includes concept, core skills, proficiencies, starting gear, backstory hooks, and examples in play. Use these as drop-in templates for quick character creation or as customization starting points for more developed characters.

For mechanical details on skills, see Mechanics Reference Guide Chapters 07-11 (genre skills). For proficiencies, see Chapters 13-17. For backstory development, see Chapter 06.

## How to Use Archetypes {#how-to-use}

Archetypes are fiction-first templates that provide:

- **Concept**: A clear character identity and role
- **Core Skills**: 3-5 skills from the Mechanics Reference Guide that define the archetype's capabilities
- **Proficiencies**: 2-3 specialized proficiencies that support the archetype
- **Starting Gear**: Genre-appropriate equipment to begin play
- **Backstory Hook**: A narrative seed for character development
- **Example in Play**: A brief vignette showing the archetype in action

**Quick Creation**: Choose an archetype, note the skills and proficiencies, select starting gear, and begin play.

**Customization**: Swap one or two skills for others from the same genre chapter, adjust proficiencies to fit your concept, and develop the backstory hook into a full character history (see Chapter 06).

**Cross-Genre Play**: Many archetypes translate across genres. A Cozy Baker becomes a Sci-Fi ship's cook. A Fantasy Warrior becomes a Modern soldier. Use the template as a foundation and adjust skills to the new setting.

## Cozy Archetypes {#cozy-archetypes}

Cozy archetypes celebrate domestic mastery, artisan crafts, and community connection. They excel at creating comfort, building relationships, and nurturing growth.

### Baker/Chef {#pc-cozy-baker}

**Concept**: You transform flour, butter, and patience into warmth. Your kitchen is a sanctuary, and your food brings people together. Whether running a bakery, managing an inn, or feeding travelers, you create nourishment that feeds body and spirit.

**Core Skills** (see Ch. 07):
- [Baking](#skill-baking) — Your specialty; bread, pastries, and contest-worthy creations
- [Cooking](#skill-cooking) — Everyday meals and improvised feasts

- Festival Organizer — Planning community events centered around food

**Starting Gear**: Professional oven or hearth access, quality baking tools, starter ingredients (flour, butter, sugar, yeast), recipe book, apron, market connections for fresh ingredients.

**Backstory Hook**: You learned to bake from a family member who taught you that food is love made visible. Now you run your own establishment, but you are still perfecting the one recipe they never shared—their secret signature dish.

**Example in Play**: The village festival is tomorrow, and the mayor's birthday cake must be perfect. You roll Baking (DC 18) and succeed with a 19. Your three-tier berry cake becomes the centerpiece of the celebration, earning you the Mayor's Favor tag and a commission for the upcoming harvest feast.

**Example in Play**: The party encounters a warded door blocking the crypt. You roll Arcana (DC 18) to analyze the ward, then Ritual (DC 18) to dispel it safely. You succeed with a 19 and 17—the ward dissolves, and the party proceeds without triggering traps.

---

### Rogue {#pc-fantasy-rogue}

**Concept**: You succeed through cunning, agility, and precision. Whether a guild thief, a scout for hire, or a treasure hunter, you excel at infiltration, finding what others hide, and striking from shadows.

**Example in Play**: A ghost haunts the abandoned mansion. You roll Occult Lore (DC 18) to identify it, then Ritual Knowledge (DC 20) to perform a banishment. You succeed with a 19 on the first, and partial (18) on the second—the ghost is weakened and confined to the attic, buying time for a stronger ritual.

---

### Survivor {#pc-horror-survivor}

**Concept**: You have endured what breaks others. Whether a trauma survivor, a street-smart fugitive, or someone who escaped a nightmare, you know how to stay alive when everything goes wrong. You trust your instincts and improvise solutions.

**Example in Play**: A car crash leaves your partner critically injured. You roll Medicine (DC 18) to treat the head wound and stabilize them. You succeed with a 17 (partial)—the bleeding stops, but they gain the Concussed condition and need hospital care within hours.

---

## Sci-Fi Archetypes {#scifi-archetypes}

Sci-fi archetypes explore futures shaped by technology, alien life, and interstellar challenges. They excel at piloting, engineering, and xenoscience.

### Pilot {#pc-scifi-pilot}

**Backstory Hook**: You salvaged or repaired something that should have stayed broken—an AI, a weapon, a piece of alien tech. It works now, but you are not sure it should. You keep it close, unsure whether it is a tool or a threat.

**Example in Play**: The ship's reactor overloads during combat. You roll System Engineering (DC 20) to stabilize it. You succeed with an 18 (partial)—the reactor stabilizes, but power is reduced to 60%. Life support holds, but weapons and hyperspace are offline until full repairs.

---

### Xenobiologist {#pc-scifi-xenobiologist}

**Concept**: You study the infinite diversity of life across the galaxy. Whether a researcher, medic, or field scientist, you analyze alien organisms, treat non-human injuries, and bridge the gap between human understanding and xenological reality.

## Using PC Archetypes {#using-archetypes}

Archetypes provide narrative identity and mechanical coherence. When creating PCs:

- **Choose Concept First**: Pick the archetype that resonates with the character you want to play.
- **Adapt to Setting**: Swap skills and proficiencies to fit the specific campaign world or GM's guidelines.
- **Develop Backstory**: Use the backstory hook as a seed. Expand it with motivations, relationships, and secrets (see Chapter 06).
- **Mix and Match**: Combine skills from different archetypes within the same genre to create hybrid characters (a Fantasy Warrior who studies Arcana, a Cozy Baker who also Forages).
- **Cross-Genre Translation**: Adapt archetypes to new genres by swapping skills while keeping the core concept (a Detective becomes a Sci-Fi investigator using Surveillance and Hacking).

For building characters from scratch, see Player Guide Chapter 05 (Character Creation). For templates and plug-and-play kits, see Chapter 05. For backstory development tools, see Chapter 06.
