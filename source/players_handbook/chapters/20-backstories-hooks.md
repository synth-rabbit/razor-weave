# Chapter 06: Backstories and Hooks {#chapter-06}

Characters are more than skills and proficiencies. They are people shaped by pasts, driven by desires, haunted by failures, and defined by relationships. A compelling backstory gives characters depth, provides narrative hooks for GMs, and creates investment in the story.

This chapter provides tools for creating rich character histories quickly or developing them deeply. It includes backstory templates, quick hooks organized by genre, and personality tables for defining motivations, flaws, and quirks. Use these tools to create characters who feel real, relatable, and ready to grow.

For archetypes and mechanical templates, see Chapters 04-05. For integrating backstories into campaign arcs, see GM Toolkit Chapter 04 (Character Arcs).

## How to Use This Chapter {#how-to-use}

Backstory creation operates at two levels:

**Quick Hooks**: One-sentence narrative seeds that provide immediate character motivation and GM integration points. Roll or choose a hook, note it on your character sheet, and begin play. Develop details during gameplay.

**Deep Development**: Full backstory templates with motivations, secrets, relationships, and integration hooks. Use these when you want a richly detailed character history before play begins, or develop them during downtime between sessions.

**Collaborative Creation**: Share backstory elements with your GM before play. GMs can weave backstories into campaigns, create NPC connections, and design story arcs that resonate with character histories.

**Evolution During Play**: Backstories are not static. Characters grow, discover new truths, and redefine themselves through play. Update backstories as characters change.

---

## Backstory Templates {#backstory-templates}

Templates provide narrative frameworks organized by common character archetypes. Each template includes motivations (what drives the character), secrets (hidden truths), relationships (connections to world and party), genre variants, and integration hooks for GMs.

## Integration and Development {#integration-development}

Backstories are most powerful when integrated into gameplay:

**Share with Your GM**: Provide your backstory to the GM before or during Session Zero. GMs can weave backstories into campaigns, create meaningful NPCs, and design arcs that resonate with character histories.

**Create Party Connections**: Discuss backstories with other players. Establish relationships, shared history, or complementary motivations that tie the party together narratively.

**Update During Play**: Characters grow through experience. Update your backstory as you learn new truths, form new relationships, or redefine yourself. Add notes about significant events, changed beliefs, or resolved conflicts.

**Use Downtime**: Develop backstory elements during downtime between adventures. Write letters, visit family, research mysteries, or pursue personal goals. Backstory is not just past—it is ongoing character life.

**Create Narrative Hooks**: Give your GM tools to engage your character. Include NPCs who might reappear, unresolved conflicts that could escalate, or mysteries that drive investigation. Backstories provide fuel for future stories.

For character creation procedures, see Player Guide Chapter 05. For archetypes and templates, see Chapters 04-05. For integrating backstories into campaign arcs, see GM Toolkit Chapter 04.
