# How to Read the Rules {#ph-how-to-read-the-rules}

Understanding the rules means understanding how uncertainty resolves at the table. When you declare an action with an uncertain outcome, you roll dice. The result determines not just whether you succeed, but how the fiction changes in response. This chapter breaks down the core mechanical framework: how dice work, what DCs mean, how outcomes shape the story, and how the environment affects your actions.

## Rolling Dice {#rolling-dice}

This game uses **4d6** (four six-sided dice) as its core resolution mechanic. When the GM calls for a check, you roll 4d6, sum all the dice, add your relevant bonus, and compare the total to a Difficulty Class (DC) set by the GM.

### The Basic Roll {#basic-roll}

Here's how a check works:

1. **Declare your action** with clear intent: what you're trying to accomplish and how
2. **GM sets the DC** based on the fiction: how difficult is this given the circumstances?
3. **Roll 4d6** and sum all four dice
4. **Add your bonus** from your relevant attribute or skill
5. **Compare to the DC**: your total determines your outcome tier
6. **Calculate margin**: subtract the DC from your total (Roll - DC = Margin)
7. **Interpret the result**: your margin determines how well or poorly you did

**Example**: You're trying to climb a wall under pressure. The GM sets DC 16 (Tough—it's slippery and time is short). You have +3 from your AGI attribute. You roll 4d6 and get 3, 5, 4, 6 = 18. Add your +3 bonus = 21 total. Your margin is 21 - 16 = +5, which is a Critical Success—you not only climb quickly, but you find a secure position that gives you advantage on your next action.

### Key Statistics {#key-statistics}

Understanding the dice helps you assess risk:

- **Average roll**: 14 (before bonuses)
- **Range**: 4 to 24 (before bonuses)
- **Distribution**: Bell curve centered on 14. Most rolls cluster near the average. Extremes (very low or very high) are rare but possible.

This bell curve means:
- Routine tasks (DC 12-14) are likely to succeed if you have any positive bonus
- Tough challenges (DC 16-18) require good rolls or favorable circumstances
- Legendary tasks (DC 22) demand both skill and luck

### Dice Notation {#dice-notation}

You'll see dice notation throughout the rules:
- **4d6** means "roll four six-sided dice and sum them"
- **d6** means "a single six-sided die"
- **2d6** means "roll two six-sided dice and add them together"

When you see "roll 4d6 + bonus," that's the core resolution mechanic. Nearly everything in this game uses that same foundation.

### Advantage and Disadvantage {#advantage-disadvantage}

Sometimes circumstances tilt in your favor (or against you). Instead of adjusting the DC, the game uses **advantage** and **disadvantage** to modify your dice pool:

**Advantage** means you roll extra dice and keep the best 4:
- **+1 Advantage**: Roll 5d6, keep the best 4 dice
- **+2 Advantage**: Roll 6d6, keep the best 4 dice

**Disadvantage** means you roll extra dice and keep the worst 4:
- **-1 Disadvantage**: Roll 5d6, keep the worst 4 dice
- **-2 Disadvantage**: Roll 6d6, keep the worst 4 dice

**Stacking**: Multiple sources of advantage or disadvantage don't stack beyond ±2 levels. If you have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel out—net them (e.g., +1 advantage and -1 disadvantage = roll normally with 4d6).

**When do you get advantage or disadvantage?** The GM grants these based on the fiction:
- **Advantage**: Favorable positioning (elevated ground), superior tools (masterwork lockpicks), helpful circumstances (enemy distracted), or supportive tags (Dim Light when sneaking)
- **Disadvantage**: Poor positioning (cramped space), inadequate tools (improvised weapon), hindering circumstances (wounded), or hostile tags (Slick floor when climbing)

**Example (Advantage)**: You're tracking someone through fresh mud (+1 advantage from favorable circumstances). You roll 5d6: 2, 4, 5, 3, 6. You keep the best 4: 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Add your +2 Survival bonus = 20 total against DC 16. Margin +4, a strong Full Success.

**Example (Disadvantage)**: You're climbing a slick wall (-1 disadvantage from the Slick tag). You roll 5d6: 2, 4, 5, 3, 6. You keep the worst 4: 2, 3, 4, 5 = 14. Add your +3 Athletics bonus = 17 total against DC 16. Margin +1, a narrow Full Success—you make it, but barely.

## Understanding DCs {#understanding-dcs}

When you declare an action with uncertain outcome, the GM sets a **Difficulty Class (DC)**—the target number you need to meet or exceed. The DC comes from the fiction: it reflects risk, opposition, tools, positioning, and time pressure.

Here's what each DC tier means in practice:

- **DC 12 (Easy):** You have good position, adequate time, and proper tools. This might still matter because of what happens if you fail, but success is likely for anyone competent.
  - Example: Picking a simple lock with proper tools and no pressure

- **DC 14 (Routine):** Standard challenge under normal conditions. If you're trained and have a moment to focus, you'll usually succeed.
  - Example: Persuading a neutral merchant, climbing a wall with handholds

- **DC 16 (Tough):** Notable obstacles, poor angle, or time pressure. You'll need skill or favorable circumstances to reliably succeed.
  - Example: Disabling a trap while guards approach, navigating through a storm

- **DC 18 (Hard):** Steep odds, strong opposition, or tight timing. Even skilled characters face real risk of failure.
  - Example: Treating an exotic poison, infiltrating a heavily guarded facility

- **DC 20 (Heroic):** Exceptional challenge with complications stacked against you. Success requires both skill and luck (or advantage from setup).
  - Example: Tracking through a blizzard, convincing a hostile crowd

- **DC 22 (Legendary):** Near-impossible without perfect setup, significant advantage, or extraordinary luck. The GM should rarely set DCs this high—most "impossible" tasks shouldn't have a roll at all.
  - Example: Predicting a rare celestial event, disarming an ancient magical mechanism

**The GM sets DCs based on circumstances, not your character's ability.** Your bonuses represent your skill. The DC represents the task's inherent difficulty given the situation. A DC 16 lock doesn't become DC 14 because you're good at lockpicking—instead, you're more likely to beat DC 16 because of your bonus.

## Outcome Tiers {#outcome-tiers}

Your margin (Roll - DC) determines how well or poorly you did. The game has five outcome tiers:

### Critical Success (Margin ≥ +5) {#critical-success}

You succeed spectacularly with extra benefit. Not only do you achieve your goal, you gain something additional: extra information, improved position, a cleared obstacle, or narrative advantage.

**Examples:**
- Picking a lock: You open it silently, find a hidden compartment, and recognize the maker's mark
- Persuading an NPC: They agree enthusiastically and offer to do more than you asked
- Combat attack: You deal damage and create an opening for an ally or knock the enemy off balance

### Full Success (Margin ≥ 0) {#full-success}

You achieve your goal cleanly. Progress ticks, you gain position, or you clear an obstacle. This is the default "success" outcome—you did what you set out to do without complication.

**Examples:**
- Picking a lock: You open it efficiently and enter
- Persuading an NPC: They agree to your request
- Combat attack: You deal damage as intended

### Partial Success (Margin -1 to -2) {#partial-success}

You succeed, but with a cost, complication, or reduced effect. The GM typically pre-states what the cost might be before you roll: "You can leap the gap, but you'll land hard and take the Winded condition" or "You convince the guard, but she'll want a favor later."

Partials keep the story moving forward while maintaining tension. You make progress, but the situation gets more complicated.

**Examples:**
- Picking a lock (Partial): You open it, but your tools break or the mechanism jams—you're getting through, but you can't lock it behind you
- Persuading an NPC (Partial): They agree, but demand immediate payment or an uncomfortable compromise
- Combat attack (Partial): You deal reduced damage or the enemy counterattacks

### Failure (Margin ≤ -3) {#failure}

You don't achieve your goal, and the situation complicates. The GM introduces a new obstacle, escalates danger, or fills a pressure clock. Failures move the story forward—they change what happens next rather than stalling play.

**Examples:**
- Picking a lock (Failure): The lock stays shut and you hear footsteps approaching—the guards are coming
- Persuading an NPC (Failure): They refuse and grow suspicious of your motives
- Combat attack (Failure): You miss and leave yourself exposed, or the enemy seizes the initiative

### Critical Failure (Margin ≤ -7 or all 1s) {#critical-failure}

A disaster occurs—the worst possible result with major complications. The GM amplifies the failure: things break, attention is drawn, or dangerous consequences land immediately.

**Special Rule**: Rolling all 1s (1, 1, 1, 1) is always a Critical Failure regardless of bonuses or margin. Even the most skilled character can have catastrophically bad luck.

**Examples:**
- Picking a lock (Critical Failure): Your pick breaks off in the lock, jamming it permanently, and the noise alerts nearby guards
- Persuading an NPC (Critical Failure): They take offense and call for security, or spread damaging rumors about you
- Combat attack (Critical Failure): You drop your weapon, hurt yourself, or create an opening the enemy exploits viciously

### Reading Results in Play {#reading-results}

The GM interprets your margin into fiction. A margin of +8 isn't just "you rolled high"—it's "you pick the lock silently, find a hidden compartment, and have time to search it before anyone notices." The better your margin, the more favorable the outcome.

Similarly, a margin of -5 isn't just "you missed the DC"—it's "you make noise, the patrol rounds the corner, and you have seconds to decide: run, hide, or talk fast?"

Margins translate mechanical results into narrative consequences. Every roll shapes what happens next.

## Tags & Conditions {#tags--conditions}

Tags and Conditions describe how the world and your character work right now. They're visible state that everyone can see and reference.

### Tags {#tags}

**Tags** describe environments or temporary situational states. The GM names 1–2 meaningful tags per scene and makes their effects explicit.

Common tags include:
- **Environmental**: *Dim Light*, *Cramped*, *Elevated*, *Obscured*, *Slick*
- **Situational**: *Fragile Cover*, *Hazardous*, *Crowded*, *Unstable*

Tags grant advantage or disadvantage based on how you interact with them:
- *Dim Light* gives advantage to Stealth, disadvantage to ranged attacks
- *Elevated* gives advantage to ranged attacks from above
- *Slick* imposes disadvantage on movement and balance checks

You can create, change, or clear tags through actions:
- "I kick over the brazier to create Thick Smoke"
- "I spend my turn clearing rubble to remove the Obstructed tag"
- "I use an action to stabilize the Unstable scaffolding"

### Conditions {#conditions}

**Conditions** describe what's happening to your character right now. They change your capabilities—imposing disadvantage, reducing movement, or preventing certain actions.

Common conditions include:
- *Exhausted*: Disadvantage on physical actions, reduced movement
- *Restrained*: Movement severely limited, disadvantage on physical actions requiring mobility
- *Bleeding*: Time pressure—the condition worsens if not treated
- *Dazed*: Disadvantage on perception and reaction checks
- *Frightened*: Disadvantage on actions while the threat is visible

When the GM applies a condition, they explain:
- **What it does**: How it affects your capabilities
- **How to clear it**: What actions or resources remove it (first aid, rest, tactics, removing the source)

Conditions have clear mechanical effects and clear resolution paths. You're never stuck with a condition you can't eventually address.

## Clocks & Progress {#clocks--progress}

Clocks track momentum—yours and the opposition's. They're circles divided into segments (usually 4, 6, or 8) that fill as actions succeed or fail. The GM shows clocks when they matter, making stakes visible.

### Progress Clocks {#progress-clocks}

**Progress Clocks** track your goals: escaping the ruin, convincing the council, disarming the ritual, investigating the mystery.

- Full Successes tick progress (usually 1 segment)
- Critical Successes tick more progress (usually 2 segments)
- Partial Successes might tick progress with a cost
- Failures don't tick progress

Fill the clock completely, you achieve the goal. Progress Clocks show how close you are to success and help pace extended challenges.

### Pressure Clocks {#pressure-clocks}

**Pressure Clocks** track escalating danger: guards arriving, fire spreading, poison taking hold, enemy reinforcements, ritual completion.

- Failures tick pressure (as pre-stated by the GM)
- Partial Successes often tick pressure (as pre-stated)
- Full Successes usually don't tick pressure

Fill the pressure clock completely, the complication lands: guards arrive, the building collapses, the poison reaches lethal toxicity, the enemy's plan succeeds.

### How Clocks Work Together {#clocks-together}

Most interesting scenes have both clocks running simultaneously. You're racing to fill your Progress Clock before the Pressure Clock fills. Each roll matters because it affects both clocks differently depending on the outcome.

The GM typically uses paired clocks for:
- Chases (Progress: Escape; Pressure: Caught)
- Investigations (Progress: Solve Mystery; Pressure: Conspiracy Realizes You're Investigating)
- Infiltrations (Progress: Reach Objective; Pressure: Security Alert Level)
- Disasters (Progress: Escape Building; Pressure: Structure Collapse)

Clocks make stakes visceral. You see progress accumulating and pressure building in real time.

**Design Philosophy: Why Clocks Work**

Clocks create **visible tension**. Traditional TTRPGs often hide progress ("how many more clues do we need?") and threats ("when will reinforcements arrive?"). This creates uncertainty, but it also breeds frustration—players can't gauge pacing or make informed choices.

Clocks solve this by making progress and danger **transparent**. You see exactly how close you are to success (Progress Clock filling) and how much time you have (Pressure Clock ticking). This creates informed urgency: "We're at 3/6 progress, but pressure is 2/4—do we push forward or retreat?"

Psychologically, filling segments is **satisfying**. Each tick forward feels like meaningful progress, even when the goal is distant. Partial successes that tick progress with a cost become interesting trade-offs, not just failures. You're always moving the story forward—either toward success or toward complication.

From a GM perspective, clocks eliminate arbitrary time tracking. Instead of "the guards arrive whenever I feel like it," the GM has a clear framework: "Failures and Partial Successes tick pressure." This keeps pacing consistent and fair. Players trust that the world responds to their actions, not GM fiat.

**In tactical terms**: Clocks reward decisive action. Stalling doesn't stop pressure clocks from filling. Taking risks (accepting Partial Success) at least advances progress. The game pushes you forward, creating momentum even in uncertain situations.

## Worked Example {#worked-example}

Let's see all these concepts working together in a complete scene:

**Setup**: You're sneaking through a manor's hallway to reach the study before guards return. The GM establishes:
- **Tag**: *Dim Light* (advantage to Stealth, disadvantage to seeing details)
- **Pressure Clock**: "Guard Patrol Returns" (4 segments, currently 2/4 filled)
- **Goal**: Reach the study and find the incriminating ledger

### Scene Play {#scene-play}

**GM**: "The hallway's dim—sconces burn low. You hear boots echoing two rooms away. The study door is ahead, maybe thirty feet. The patrol's getting close. What do you do?"

**You**: "I move quickly but quietly, using the shadows along the wall. I want to reach the study before they round the corner."

**GM**: "Stealth check, DC 14. The Dim Light tag gives you +1 advantage (roll 5d6, keep best 4). If you succeed, you reach the study. Partial means you make it but knock something over—I'll tick pressure. Failure means they spot you or you have to freeze and waste time—I'll tick pressure and you won't make progress."

**You roll 5d6 with advantage**: 2, 4, 5, 3, 6. Keep best 4: 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Add your +2 Stealth bonus = 20 total. Margin: 20 - 14 = **+6 (Critical Success)**.

**GM**: "You slip into the study silently, pulling the door almost closed behind you. The patrol passes in the hallway, completely oblivious. You even had time to notice a loose floorboard near the desk—might be useful." (No pressure tick; you gained a tactical detail from the critical success)

**Inside the study, you search for the ledger:**

**GM**: "Papers everywhere, files stacked haphazardly. This is going to take time you might not have. Let's use a Progress Clock: 'Find Ledger' (4 segments). Each success ticks progress. The guard patrol is doing their rounds—they'll eventually circle back. DC 16 for the search—tough because of the disorganization and time pressure."

**You roll 4d6**: 3, 3, 4, 4 = 14. Add your +2 Investigation bonus = 16 total. Margin: 16 - 16 = **+0 (Full Success)**.

**GM**: "You systematically check the desk drawers. Third one down, you find a ledger with recent entries. Tick progress (1/4 segments filled). As you're examining it, you hear a door creak downstairs. The patrol's still moving. What do you do?"

**You**: "I want to photograph the key pages quickly with my phone, then put it back so they don't know I was here."

**GM**: "DC 14 to do it fast and accurately. Partial means you get the photos but smudge ink or leave the desk obviously disturbed—tick pressure. Failure means you fumble with the phone and definitely alert them—tick pressure and no progress."

**You roll 4d6**: 2, 2, 5, 3 = 12. Add your +1 bonus = 13 total. Margin: 13 - 14 = **-1 (Partial Success)**.

**GM**: "You snap photos of three key pages, but in your haste you knock over an inkwell on the desk. It's obvious someone was here. Tick progress (2/4 on Find Ledger) and tick pressure (3/4 on Guard Patrol). You hear footsteps on the stairs now—they're coming up. You have the photos, but they'll know there was an intruder. What's your move?"

The scene continues. Each roll shaped the fiction: Critical Success gave you a clean entry and a bonus detail. Full Success made progress. Partial Success gave progress with a complication. Tags affected your rolls (Dim Light advantage). Clocks made the pressure visible and escalating.

That's how the rules work in play: dice determine outcomes, margins shape how good or bad those outcomes are, and everything feeds back into the fiction to create the next situation.
