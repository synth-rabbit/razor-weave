# Actions & Checks {#ph-actions-checks}



## When to Roll {#when-to-roll}

You roll when the GM calls for a check—when your action has uncertain outcomes and meaningful stakes. If you're competent with time and safety, the GM might call it auto-success. If failure would stall play, the GM might offer success with cost (Partial) or reframe failure to keep momentum.

Ask yourself: "Could this go multiple ways?" and "Does it matter now?" If yes to both, expect a roll. If no, the GM narrates forward.

### When to Roll (and When Not To) At-a-Glance {#when-to-roll-at-a-glance}

The **GM** (Game Master—the person who facilitates the game and describes the world) calls for rolls when three criteria align:

**1. Uncertain Outcome**: Success isn't guaranteed. A trained locksmith opening a simple door doesn't roll. A thief picking a complex lock under pressure does.

**2. Consequential Stakes**: Failure introduces complications, costs, or escalation. If failure just means "try again," don't roll—either it succeeds with time or it's impossible.

**3. Player Agency**: The character can meaningfully influence the result. Don't roll for things completely outside control (like whether a distant NPC makes a decision).

**Examples of When TO Roll:**

- Sneaking past alert guards (uncertain, you could be spotted; consequential, detection changes everything; agency, your approach matters)
- Convincing a skeptical merchant to extend credit (uncertain, she's cautious; consequential, failure means finding another source; agency, your persuasion matters)
- Climbing a crumbling wall during a storm (uncertain, conditions are poor; consequential, falling causes injury and delays; agency, your technique matters)

**Examples of When NOT to Roll:**

- An expert chef making simple bread (certain for their skill level, no stakes)
- Searching a room when you have unlimited time and no threats (inevitable success, no pressure)
- Whether a random **NPC** (Non-Player Character—controlled by the GM) arrives at a location (no player agency)

When all three criteria are met, roll a **check**: `4d6` (four six-sided dice) + modifiers vs **DC** (Difficulty Class—target number to meet or exceed). Otherwise, the GM narrates forward without dice.

## Declaring Actions {#declaring-actions}

When you declare an action, state two things:

**Intent:** What you're trying to accomplish. "I climb the wall" or "I convince the captain to let us pass."

**Approach:** How you're doing it. "Using handholds, moving quietly" or "Appealing to her duty, offering coin."

The GM uses intent and approach to pick the DC, determine which skill or proficiency applies, and decide on Advantage or Disadvantage. Be specific—your approach shapes fiction and mechanics. If the GM asks for clarification, they're helping you find the best angle or exposing risks.

## Advantage & Disadvantage {#advantage--disadvantage}

The fiction grants mechanical shifts through **advantage** and **disadvantage**. Instead of adjusting the DC, the game modifies your dice pool to represent favorable or unfavorable circumstances.

**Advantage** means you roll extra dice and keep the best 4:
- **+1 Advantage**: Roll 5d6, keep the best 4 dice
- **+2 Advantage**: Roll 6d6, keep the best 4 dice

**Disadvantage** means you roll extra dice and keep the worst 4:
- **-1 Disadvantage**: Roll 5d6, keep the worst 4 dice
- **-2 Disadvantage**: Roll 6d6, keep the worst 4 dice

**You gain Advantage when:**

- You have superior positioning (high ground, cover, surprise, flanking)
- You're using expert tools or specialized gear
- An ally is actively helping you (and the GM agrees their help is meaningful)
- The environment favors your approach (quiet space for stealth, good lighting for searching, stable footing for athletics)
- You took a setup action first (scouted ahead, cleared obstacles, coordinated with allies)

**You have Disadvantage when:**

- Positioning works against you (cramped space, unstable footing, exposed position)
- You lack proper tools or are improvising with unsuitable equipment
- You're rushed, distracted, or under significant pressure
- The environment hinders you (dim light for precise work, loud noise for stealth, rough terrain for movement)
- You have a relevant condition (*Exhausted*, *Dazed*, *Bleeding*, *Frightened*)

**Important**: Advantage and disadvantage come in levels (±1 or ±2), but they cap at those levels. Multiple sources of +1 advantage don't stack to become +2—you need a particularly strong source for +2. If you have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel out—net them (e.g., +1 advantage and -1 disadvantage = roll normally with 4d6; +2 advantage and -1 disadvantage = +1 advantage, roll 5d6 keep best 4).

You can create Advantage by taking a setup action first: scouting ahead, clearing obstacles, or coordinating with allies. This is often tactically smart—spend one turn creating advantage for a critical roll.

### Advantage & Disadvantage Quick Reference {#advantage-disadvantage-quick-reference}

**Core Rule: They Net Out at ±2 Levels**

Advantage and disadvantage come in two levels each:
- **+1 Advantage**: Roll 5d6, keep best 4
- **+2 Advantage**: Roll 6d6, keep best 4
- **-1 Disadvantage**: Roll 5d6, keep worst 4
- **-2 Disadvantage**: Roll 6d6, keep worst 4

Multiple sources of the same type don't stack beyond these levels. You either have +1 advantage, +2 advantage, normal, -1 disadvantage, or -2 disadvantage.

**Competing Sources Cancel Out**

When you have both advantage and disadvantage from different sources, they cancel partially or completely:
- **+1 Advantage + -1 Disadvantage** = Roll normally (4d6)
- **+2 Advantage + -1 Disadvantage** = +1 Advantage (5d6, keep best 4)
- **+1 Advantage + -2 Disadvantage** = -1 Disadvantage (5d6, keep worst 4)
- **+2 Advantage + -2 Disadvantage** = Roll normally (4d6)

**Example:**

You're shooting at an enemy from high ground (*Elevated* tag grants +1 Advantage) but visibility is poor (*Dim Light* tag imposes -1 Disadvantage). The two effects cancel completely—you roll 4d6 normally.

**Common Sources of Advantage:**

- **Superior positioning**: High ground, cover for ranged attacks, flanking in melee
- **Specialized tools or gear**: Masterwork lockpicks, precision instruments, quality climbing equipment
- **Ally actively helping**: Someone distracts the guard while you sneak, holds the rope while you climb
- **Environmental favor**: Good lighting for detailed work, stable footing for athletics, quiet space for stealth
- **Setup actions**: You scouted the route first, you cleared obstacles beforehand, you coordinated signals with allies

**Common Sources of Disadvantage:**

- **Poor positioning**: Cramped quarters, unstable footing, no cover while exposed
- **Improvised tools**: Using a dagger as a pry bar, rope instead of proper climbing gear
- **Time pressure or distraction**: Guards approaching, building collapsing, ally calling for help
- **Environmental hindrance**: Dim light for ranged attacks, rough terrain for movement, loud noise for stealth
- **Conditions**: *Exhausted* (physical actions), *Dazed* (perception and reactions), *Frightened* (actions while threat visible), *Bleeding* (strenuous activity)

**Edge Case: Multiple Sources of Same Type**

Even if you have three sources of +1 advantage (high ground, expert tools, and an ally helping), you still only get +1 advantage—roll 5d6, keep best 4. Advantage doesn't compound beyond ±2 levels.

---

**Design Philosophy: Why Advantage Caps at ±2**

Advantage and disadvantage are capped at ±2 levels for a crucial design reason: **bounded accuracy**. The system is built on a predictable range of outcomes (rolling 4d6, average ~14, range 4-24). If advantage stacked without limit, characters could engineer guaranteed success by layering multiple benefits, breaking the tension that makes rolls meaningful.

Capping at ±2 preserves meaningful risk. Even with every advantage (+2 advantage = 6d6 keep best 4, average ~17), you can still roll badly. Even with significant disadvantage (-2 disadvantage = 6d6 keep worst 4, average ~11), you can still succeed through luck or player resourcefulness. The dice still matter.

This cap also prevents "advantage farming"—the temptation to delay action while stacking every possible benefit. The game rewards smart positioning and preparation (setup actions grant advantage), but doesn't let you optimize away all risk. Competence improves your odds; it doesn't eliminate failure.

In tactical terms: **Get advantage when you can, but don't chase perfection**. +1 advantage (~+1.5 to average roll) is meaningful. +2 advantage (~+3 to average roll) is strong. But you'll never reach a point where rolls become trivial. The fiction remains dynamic, and outcomes stay uncertain.

---

To get +2 advantage, you typically need an exceptionally favorable situation or a particularly powerful source (magic, special abilities, or the GM judging the circumstances are overwhelmingly in your favor).

**Common Misconception**: "If I have two advantages and one disadvantage, do I still get advantage?"

It depends on the levels. If you have +1 advantage from two sources (which doesn't stack, so it's just +1) and -1 disadvantage from one source, they cancel out—you roll normally (4d6).

If you have +2 advantage from an exceptional circumstance and -1 disadvantage from a condition, you net to +1 advantage (roll 5d6, keep best 4).

Always net out advantage and disadvantage levels before rolling.

**For complete Advantage/Disadvantage mechanics**: See [How to Read the Rules (Chapter 2)](./02-how-to-read-the-rules.md#advantage-disadvantage) and [Mechanics Reference, Chapter 2 (Rolling Dice)](../../mechanics_reference/chapters/02-core-concepts.md#rolling-dice).

## Reading Results {#reading-results}

Compare your total (4d6 + modifiers) to the DC. Calculate your margin (Roll - DC). The margin determines your outcome tier and tells you what changed.

**Critical Success (Margin ≥+5):** You achieve your intent spectacularly with extra benefit—extra information, improved position, a cleared obstacle, or narrative advantage.

**Full Success (Margin ≥0):** You achieve your intent cleanly. The situation shifts in your favor—progress ticks, obstacles clear, or you gain position.

**Partial Success (Margin -1 to -2):** You achieve your intent with a complication. The GM pre-stated this: a cost, trade-off, or wrinkle. You moved forward, but so did pressure or danger.

**Failure (Margin ≤-3):** You don't achieve your intent. The situation escalates or reveals a problem. The GM describes what changed—guards heard you, the ledge crumbles, the NPC shuts down. Failure changes what happens next.

**Critical Failure (Margin ≤-7 or all 1s):** A disaster occurs—the worst possible result with major complications. Things break, attention is drawn, or dangerous consequences land immediately.

Ask yourself: "What's different now?" Results always shift the fiction.

## Group Actions {#group-actions}

When the party works together, the GM picks one:

**Group Check (Majority):** Everyone rolls. If most succeed, the group succeeds. If split, treat as Partial. Use when each contributes independently (sneaking, searching).

**Group Check (All‑Must‑Succeed):** Everyone rolls; a single failure breaks the attempt. Use when chained together (fragile bridge, coordinated ritual).

**Helping:** If not rolling but assisting, describe how. The GM might grant Advantage to the lead character.

**Contests:** Both sides roll. Higher total wins. The GM pre-states outcomes for each side (chase, debate, arm-wrestling).

### Group Checks Quick Reference {#group-checks-quick-reference}

When multiple **PCs** (Player Characters—the characters you control) collaborate on a shared goal, use group checks to streamline resolution and share risk.

**How Group Checks Work:**

1. **Identify the leader**—the character most qualified or driving the effort.
2. **The leader rolls** the check against the DC (4d6 + modifiers).
3. **Assistants provide Advantage** by contributing meaningfully. Each assistant describes how they help. If their contribution makes sense, the GM grants advantage levels (usually +1, sometimes +2 if the help is exceptional).
4. **Everyone shares the consequences**. If the check results in a Partial or Failure, assistants take on costs too.

**Example: Climbing a Cliff**

Your party climbs a steep cliff to reach a fortress. The GM sets DC 16 (Tough—rocky, unstable handholds). The character with highest MIG or AGI leads. Another character with rope and climbing experience describes securing anchors and guiding the route—the GM grants +1 Advantage. The leader rolls 5d6 (keep best 4) + modifiers.

- **Critical Success (21+, margin ≥+5):** Everyone reaches the top safely, and you find a hidden ledge that provides a perfect vantage point for scouting the fortress.
- **Full Success (16-20, margin ≥0):** Everyone reaches the top safely. No complications.
- **Partial Success (14-15, margin -1 to -2):** Everyone makes it, but the rope frays badly. It'll break if used again without repair.
- **Failure (11-13, margin ≤-3):** The leader slips. Everyone stops to stabilize them, losing time. Pressure clock ticks (guards patrol closer).
- **Critical Failure (≤10 or all 1s):** The leader falls, dragging others down. Everyone takes damage and makes noise—guards are alerted immediately.

**Key Points:**

- Only those who can meaningfully contribute should assist. Don't let the whole party help with a Hacking check if only one character has the skill.
- Assistants share the risk. If the check fails or goes Partial, everyone faces consequences (not just the leader).
- The leader's skill determines the roll, but assistance grants advantage levels (not multiple rolls).

**When to Use Group Checks:**

Use them for collaborative efforts where everyone contributes: climbing, sneaking, searching, coordinating a distraction, or executing a plan together. Don't use them when characters have truly independent goals—those require separate rolls.

**For complete group check mechanics**: See [Mechanics Reference, Chapter 3 (Group Checks)](../../mechanics_reference/chapters/03-check-resolution.md#group-checks).

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: Exploration (Climbing a Wall) {#example-1-exploration}

**You:** "I want to climb the outer wall to reach the second-floor window."

**GM:** "How are you doing it?"

**You:** "I'm using the stonework gaps as handholds and moving slowly to stay quiet."

**GM:** "DC 16—it's steep and the stone is old. Partial means you make it but dislodge rubble and alert the guards inside. Roll AGI."

**You roll 4d6**: 3, 5, 4, 6 = 18. Add your +3 AGI bonus = 21 total. **Margin: +5 (Critical Success).**

**GM:** "You scale the wall smoothly, finding solid grips with practiced ease. You reach the window ledge without a sound, and as you peer inside, you spot a guard's patrol schedule pinned to the wall—valuable intel. You're in position with extra information."

### Example 2: Social (Persuading a Guard) {#example-2-social}

**You:** "I want to convince the guard to let us into the restricted wing."

**GM:** "What's your approach?"

**You:** "I'm appealing to her sense of duty, saying we're investigating threats to the city and need access now."

**GM:** "She's skeptical but not hostile. DC 14. Partial means she lets you in but assigns an escort who'll watch you. Roll PRE."

**You roll 4d6**: 2, 3, 3, 4 = 12. Add your +1 PRE bonus = 13 total. **Margin: -1 (Partial Success).**

**GM:** "She narrows her eyes, then nods slowly. 'Fine. But Corporal Vance goes with you. Don't try anything.' She whistles, and a stern-looking soldier appears. You're in, but you have a suspicious escort watching your every move."

### Example 3: Using Advantage {#example-3-advantage}

**You:** "Before I try to pick the lock, I want to examine it carefully to understand its mechanism."

**GM:** "Smart. Roll Investigation, DC 14."

**You roll and succeed.**

**GM:** "You notice it's a three-pin tumbler, and the third pin sticks slightly—you can use that. When you pick it, you'll have +1 advantage."

**You:** "Great. Now I'm picking the lock, using what I learned."

**GM:** "DC 16 to pick it quietly. Roll 5d6, keep the best 4, add your Thievery bonus."

**You roll 5d6**: 2, 3, 5, 4, 6. Keep best 4: 3, 4, 5, 6 = 18. Add your +2 Thievery = 20 total. **Margin: +4 (Full Success).**

**GM:** "The lock clicks open smoothly, the sticky pin giving you perfect feedback. You ease the door open—no sound, no alert. You're in."

The setup action created advantage, which significantly improved your chances and turned what could have been risky into a smooth success.
