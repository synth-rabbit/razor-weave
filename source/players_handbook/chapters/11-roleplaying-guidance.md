# Roleplaying Guidance {#ph-roleplaying-guidance}



## Roleplaying Fundamentals {#roleplaying-fundamentals}

**Roleplaying** means inhabiting your character and making choices through
their perspective. You're not playing to win; you're playing to create
compelling stories.

Speak as your character. React to the world. Make decisions based on who they
are, not just tactical advantage.

## Creating Memorable Characters {#creating-memorable-characters}

**Distinct Voice:** Give your character a recognizable way of speaking or
acting. Terse and direct. Verbose and academic. Cautious and skeptical. Voice
makes them memorable.

**Clear Motivations:** What drives your character? Revenge, justice, curiosity,
survival, wealth, redemption. Motivations guide choices and create drama when
they conflict with others' goals.

**Flaws and Strengths:** Perfect characters are boring. Give yours flaws—
arrogance, distrust, recklessness, stubbornness. Flaws create complications.
Strengths show what they excel at. Both make them human.

Examples: A cynical investigator who doesn't trust authority. A brave knight
who's too proud to ask for help. A scholar who freezes under pressure but
excels with preparation.

## Engaging with Fiction {#engaging-with-fiction}

**Describe Actions Vividly:** Don't just say "I attack." Say "I lunge low,
aiming for the guard's knee." Vivid descriptions make scenes come alive.

**React to Outcomes:** When the GM describes a result, respond. If you fail to
pick the lock, show frustration or improvise a new plan. If you succeed but
alert the guard, react to the complication.

**Build on Details:** When the GM or another player adds a detail, incorporate
it. "The tavern smells like smoke"—"I cough and pull my cloak over my face."

## Making Meaningful Choices {#making-meaningful-choices}

**Choose What Your Character Would Do:** Sometimes the optimal tactical choice
isn't what your character would do. If they're protective, they'll risk
themselves for allies. If they're vengeful, they'll pursue revenge over safety.

**Embrace Consequences:** Partial Success and Failure drive stories. Don't
avoid risk to prevent complications. Complications create drama and opportunity.

**Trust Your Group:** Make choices that create space for others. Share
spotlight. Support their arcs. Collaborative storytelling means everyone shines.

## Scene-Specific Roleplaying {#scene-specific-roleplaying}

### Combat Scenes {#combat-scenes}

**Describe Actions with Character Flair:** Your fighter charges headlong,
roaring a battle cry. Your rogue circles cautiously, looking for openings. Your
tactician barks orders while covering allies. Combat is character expression.

**React to Wounds and Setbacks:** When your resolve clock ticks, show it. Grimace,
stagger, show desperation or fury. When an ally falls, react—rage, fear, determination.

**Use Tactical Choices to Show Character:** Protecting the wounded shows loyalty.
Pursuing a fleeing enemy shows determination or vengeance. Holding ground while
others retreat shows courage or stubbornness. Mechanics reveal character.

**Example:**

**You (as Elara):** "The bandit lunges at the scholar. I can't let that happen—
I dive between them, blades up, and shout 'You'll have to go through me first!'"

**GM:** "He takes the bait, turning on you. Roll to Defend—DC 16."

**You roll 14 (Partial Success).**

**GM:** "You block his strike, but the force drives you back. You're now *Exposed*—
Disadvantage on defense next round. But the scholar is safe and fleeing."

**You:** "Worth it. I grit my teeth and ready for his next strike."

### Social Scenes {#social-scenes}

**Speak in Character Voice:** Use phrases or speech patterns that fit your character.
A street urchin talks differently than a noble. Consistent voice makes your
character recognizable.

**Show Don't Tell Emotions:** Instead of "I'm angry," describe clenched fists or
a cold stare. Instead of "I'm scared," describe shallow breathing or avoiding
eye contact.

**React to NPC Body Language:** When the GM describes an NPC's hesitation or
defensive posture, respond. "I notice he's avoiding my eyes. I soften my tone
and say, 'You're not in trouble. I just need to know what you saw.'"

**Example:**

**GM:** "The merchant leans back, arms crossed. 'I don't know anything about
that shipment.'"

**You (as Marcus):** "I notice the way he glances at the back room. I pull out
a datastick and slide it across the table. 'This has evidence that clears you
of involvement. But I need names—who paid you to look the other way?'"

**GM:** "Roll Persuasion, DC 16."

**You roll 17 (Full Success).**

**GM:** "He hesitates, then nods slowly. 'Varren Corp. They said it was routine
cargo. I didn't ask questions.' He's cooperating now."

### Exploration & Investigation Scenes {#exploration--investigation-scenes}

**Describe Your Approach:** Are you cautious or bold? Methodical or intuitive?
"I check each crate carefully, listening for movement" versus "I stride in and
call out 'Show yourself!'"

**React to Clues and Danger:** When you find blood on the floor, show concern
or determination. When a trap almost triggers, show relief or heightened caution.

**Build Theories Aloud:** Share your character's reasoning. "This doesn't make
sense—why leave the door unlocked unless they wanted us to enter?" Speculation
creates engagement.

**Example:**

**GM:** "You find a hidden compartment in the desk. Inside is a letter—coded,
but you recognize the seal."

**You (as Kaida):** "My hands shake. That's an OmniCorp executive seal—this
goes higher than I thought. I photograph it with my neural interface and pocket
the original. We need to move—if they're watching, they know we're close."

**GM:** "As you turn to leave, you hear footsteps in the hall. Pressure clock
ticks to 3/4."

**You:** "Damn. I motion to the crew—'Back exit, now.' We move fast and quiet."

## Maintaining Character Consistency {#maintaining-character-consistency}

**Track Your Character's Growth:** Characters change through play. The cynical
investigator who starts trusting allies. The reckless fighter who learns caution.
Let your character evolve, but track why they change.

**Revisit Motivations:** Check in with your character's goals. Are they still
pursuing revenge? Have they found redemption? Motivations shift—acknowledge it
in play.

**Use Flaws Consistently:** If your character is proud, they don't suddenly ask
for help without cause. If they're loyal, they don't abandon allies. Flaws create
predictability and dramatic tension when tested.

**Avoid Whiplash Shifts:** Gradual change feels earned. Sudden shifts ("I'm
suddenly ruthless after being kind for six sessions") break immersion. Let
pivotal moments justify changes.

## Handling Roleplaying Challenges {#handling-roleplaying-challenges}

### When You're Stuck for Character Voice {#when-youre-stuck-for-character-voice}

**Pick One Trait and Lean In:** Focus on a single defining trait—cynical, hopeful,
cautious, bold. Let that guide your responses until you find more nuance.

**Borrow from Fiction:** Think of a character from media who fits your concept.
What would they say? Adapt it to your character.

**Summarize Third-Person:** "My character would be suspicious here, so she
hangs back and watches." Narration is valid roleplaying.

### When Drama Conflicts with Tactics {#when-drama-conflicts-with-tactics}

**Choose Drama if the Stakes Feel Right:** If failing dramatically creates
better story than succeeding tactically, go for it. Trust your group to support
the choice.

**Discuss Meta When Needed:** "My character would chase them, but that splits
the party—should we talk this through?" Collaborating beats rigid adherence.

### When Spotlight Feels Unbalanced {#when-spotlight-feels-unbalanced}

**Create Openings for Others:** "I'm stumped—does anyone else have ideas?" or
"I can't do this alone—who's with me?"

**Step Back When Appropriate:** If you've been center stage, let others lead.
Support their scenes with reactions and assistance.

**Check In Out-of-Character:** "I feel like I've been talking a lot—does anyone
want to jump in?"
