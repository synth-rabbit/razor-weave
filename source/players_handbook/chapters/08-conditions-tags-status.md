# Conditions, Tags, and Status {#ph-conditions-tags-and-status}



## Understanding Conditions & Tags {#understanding-conditions--tags}

**Tags** describe the environment or situation: terrain, lighting, cover.
They're external to your character. *Dim Light*, *Slick*, *Fragile Cover*.

**Conditions** describe your character's state: injuries, status effects,
temporary afflictions. *Exhausted*, *Restrained*, *Bleeding*, *Stunned*.

Tags affect what you can do in a space. Conditions affect you wherever you go.
Both grant Advantage or Disadvantage, impose narrative limits, or create
tactical opportunities.

## Common Environmental Tags {#common-environmental-tags}

- **Dim Light:** Advantage to stealth; Disadvantage to ranged attacks and
  detailed observation.
- **Slick:** Disadvantage on movement and maneuvers requiring balance (ice,
  oil, wet stone).
- **Cramped:** Hinders movement; increases fall risk; limits large weapons or
  sweeping actions.
- **Fragile Cover:** Grants Advantage to defense but degrades on Partial
  Success or repeated use.
- **Solid Cover:** Reliable protection; grants Advantage to defense without
  degrading.
- **Elevated:** Advantage on ranged attacks; forces opponents to climb or find
  alternate routes.
- **Crowded:** Advantage to blend in or lose pursuit; Disadvantage to chase or
  spot targets.
- **Hazardous:** Environmental danger (fire, acid, collapsing floor); risk of
  damage or conditions.
- **Obscured:** Vision blocked (fog, smoke, darkness); Disadvantage to ranged
  attacks and navigation.
- **Unstable:** Risk of collapse, shifting terrain, or loss of footing;
  movement requires checks.

## Common Conditions {#common-conditions}

Conditions represent your character's state—injuries, status effects, or
temporary afflictions that follow you regardless of location.

### Physical Conditions {#physical-conditions}

**Exhausted:** Physical or mental fatigue. Disadvantage on physical actions
(combat, athletics, endurance). Clear via rest (full night) or aid (stimulants,
magic, medical treatment).

**Example:** After fighting through the ruins for hours, you're *Exhausted*.
When the patrol attacks, you have Disadvantage on all Strike and Maneuver
actions. Resting at camp for 8 hours clears the condition.

**Bleeding:** Active wound requiring immediate treatment. Time pressure—worsens
if ignored. Clear via first aid (ally uses medkit, DC 14), magic, or rest after
stabilization.

**Example:** The bandit's blade cuts deep—you're *Bleeding*. Each scene that
passes without treatment, your resolve clock ticks. An ally uses their medkit
(First Aid skill + RSN, DC 14) to stabilize you. Condition clears.

**Poisoned:** Toxin affecting you. Effects vary by poison type (Disadvantage on
actions, ongoing resolve clock damage, paralysis). Duration varies. Clear via
antidote, medical aid, or time (if non-lethal).

**Example:** The trap needle injects venom—you're *Poisoned*. Disadvantage on
all actions for the next hour unless you find an antidote. Your medic identifies
the toxin and administers the cure. Condition clears.

**Restrained:** Movement limited by bonds (ropes, chains), grapple, or obstacle
(pinned under debris). Can't move freely. Clear via breaking free (MIG check),
ally assistance, or time.

**Example:** The guard grapples you—you're *Restrained*. You can't move or
Maneuver. On your turn, roll MIG vs. their MIG to break free (DC 16). Ally
Strikes the guard to force them to release you. Condition clears.

### Mental/Combat Conditions {#mentalcombat-conditions}

**Stunned:** Dazed or disoriented from impact. Can't act next turn. Clears
automatically after one turn (no action required).

**Example:** The concussion grenade explodes nearby—you're *Stunned*. You lose
your next action. The turn after, the condition clears automatically and you
can act normally.

**Dazed:** Disoriented, struggling to focus. Disadvantage on perception,
reaction, and complex tasks. Clears after one turn or with ally assistance
(snapping you out of it).

**Example:** The flash-bang disorients you—you're *Dazed*. Disadvantage on
Investigation and Perception checks. Your ally shouts and shakes you—condition
clears immediately.

**Frightened:** Fear of visible threat. Disadvantage on actions while threat is
in sight. Clear by removing/defeating threat, rallying (ally assistance or
self-discipline check), or breaking line of sight.

**Example:** The dragon roars—you're *Frightened*. Disadvantage on all actions
while it's visible. Your ally's rallying speech lets you roll PRE, DC 14, to
shake it off. You succeed—condition clears.

**Suppressed:** Under pressure from covering fire, intimidation, or overwhelming
force. Disadvantage on next action. Clears after acting or repositioning to
safety.

**Example:** Automatic gunfire pins you down—you're *Suppressed*. Disadvantage
on your next action. You use Defend to reposition behind solid cover. Condition
clears.

### Tactical Conditions {#tactical-conditions}

**Exposed:** Out of cover, vulnerable. Disadvantage to defense. Attackers gain
Advantage against you. Clear by moving to cover or breaking line of sight.

**Example:** You're caught in the open courtyard—you're *Exposed*. Enemies have
Advantage on attacks against you. You Sprint to the pillar (Defend action).
Condition clears once behind cover.

**Marked:** Tracked or targeted by enemy. Opponent gains Advantage on attacks
against you. Clear by breaking contact (Defend/Withdraw to different zone) or
eliminating the marker.

**Example:** The sniper has you in their sights—you're *Marked*. They have
Advantage on all ranged attacks against you. You use Defend to break line of
sight by ducking into the building. Condition clears.

## Using Status in Play {#using-status-in-play}

**Leverage Tags:** Use environmental features to your advantage. Fight in *Dim
Light* for stealth. Use *Elevated* positions for ranged attacks. Create *Fragile
Cover* with Set Up actions.

**Clear Conditions:** Prioritize dangerous conditions. *Bleeding* and *Poisoned*
create time pressure. *Restrained* and *Exposed* make you vulnerable. Use
actions, resources, or allies to clear them.

**Apply Conditions:** Set Up and Maneuver actions can apply conditions to
opponents. Trip someone to make them *Exposed*. Suppress them with covering
fire. Force them into *Hazardous* terrain.

Status effects drive tactical choices. They're tools for creating and solving
problems.

## Combining Tags for Compound Effects {#combining-tags-for-compound-effects}

Tags and conditions stack to create complex tactical situations:

### Favorable Combinations (Use These) {#favorable-combinations-use-these}

**Elevated + Solid Cover:** Advantage on ranged attacks while protected. Ideal
for archers and snipers.

**Dim Light + Stealth Proficiency:** Advantage to hide and ambush. Use Set Up
to create *Dim Light* (knock out torches, trigger smoke).

**Cramped + Ranged Attacks:** If enemies are stuck in tight space, ranged
attacks from outside avoid the *Cramped* penalty.

**Hazardous + Maneuver:** Shove enemies into fire, acid, collapsing floors.
Environmental damage without spending Strike actions.

### Unfavorable Combinations (Avoid These) {#unfavorable-combinations-avoid-these}

**Slick + Cramped:** Double Disadvantage on movement and maneuvers. Falling risk
extreme. Get out fast or fight defensively.

**Exposed + Elevated:** Elevated grants Advantage to *attackers*, not you. If
you're *Exposed* on high ground, you're a target.

**Obscured + Ranged Combat:** Disadvantage to ranged attacks in fog/smoke/darkness.
Switch to melee or wait for visibility.

**Restrained + Hazardous:** Can't move away from danger. Priority: clear
*Restrained* immediately.

## Tactical Uses of Tags {#tactical-uses-of-tags}

### Creating Tags with Set Up Actions {#creating-tags-with-set-up-actions}

You can create environmental tags to shift tactical balance:

**Example 1—Creating Dim Light:**

**You:** "I shoot out the overhead lights with my pistol. Set Up action to
create *Dim Light*."

**GM:** "Roll AGI + Ranged, DC 14."

**You roll 16 (Full Success).**

**GM:** "The room plunges into darkness. *Dim Light* tag applies. Everyone has
Disadvantage on ranged attacks and detailed observation. What's next?"

**You:** "Perfect. I have *Night Vision* proficiency—I can see fine. I move to
flank the guard."

**Example 2—Creating Hazardous Terrain:**

**You:** "I kick over the brazier, spilling hot coals across the floor. Trying
to create a *Hazardous* zone between us and the enemies."

**GM:** "Maneuver action, DC 14 to place it precisely."

**You roll 13 (Partial Success).**

**GM:** "You kick it over, but it scatters unpredictably. *Hazardous* zone
created, but you're on the edge—take 1 resolve clock tick from the heat. Enemies
are now blocked unless they cross fire."

### Exploiting Existing Tags {#exploiting-existing-tags}

Use what's already there:

**Slick Terrain:** Maneuver enemies into *Slick* areas, then Shove them. They
fall prone (*Exposed*).

**Fragile Cover:** If enemies hide behind *Fragile Cover*, Strike actions degrade
it. After 2-3 hits, the cover is gone.

**Crowded Spaces:** Use *Crowded* areas to blend in (Advantage to Stealth) or
lose pursuers.

**Elevated Positions:** Claim high ground early. Once there, you force enemies
to climb (wasting actions) or take ranged fire with Disadvantage.

## Clearing Conditions Strategically {#clearing-conditions-strategically}

### Immediate Threats (Clear Now) {#immediate-threats-clear-now}

**Bleeding:** Worsens over time. Use first aid, medkits, or ally assistance to
stabilize. Don't wait—this condition kills.

**Exposed:** Disadvantage to defense means you're next. Use Defend/Withdraw to
reach cover or break line of sight.

**Restrained:** Can't move, can't escape. Use actions to break free (MIG check
typically) or have allies help.

**Poisoned (Fast-Acting):** Some poisons deal ongoing damage or escalate. Clear
with antidote, first aid, or magical healing.

### Manageable Threats (Clear When Possible) {#manageable-threats-clear-when-possible}

**Exhausted:** Disadvantage on physical actions but survivable. Rest or use
stimulants when safe.

**Suppressed:** Only lasts one action. Accept Disadvantage or use Defend to
reposition safely.

**Dazed:** Clears after one turn. If you can survive the round, condition ends
naturally.

### Strategic Choices (Weigh Cost) {#strategic-choices-weigh-cost}

**Marked:** Opponent gains Advantage against you. If you can eliminate them fast,
ignore *Marked*. If not, break contact (Defend/Withdraw).

**Frightened:** Disadvantage while threat visible. If threat is weak, ignore and
push through. If threat is strong, flee and regroup.

## Worked Example: Tag and Condition Interaction {#worked-example-tag-and-condition-interaction}

**Setup:** You're fighting mercenaries in a warehouse. The space is *Cramped*
(crates and boxes everywhere) with *Fragile Cover* (wooden crates). One
mercenary has you *Suppressed* with automatic fire.

**Round 1—You (Suppressed, in Fragile Cover):**

**You:** "I'm *Suppressed*—Disadvantage on my next action. I use Defend to break
line of sight and reposition behind *Solid Cover* (a metal support pillar)."

**GM:** "Roll AGI, DC 14 to move through the *Cramped* space without tripping."

**You roll 15 (Full Success).**

**GM:** "*Suppressed* clears. You're now behind *Solid Cover*. The mercenary
loses line of sight."

**Round 2—Ally (Archer, Elevated on catwalk):**

**Ally:** "I have *Elevated* and the mercenary is in the open. I Strike with
Advantage."

**GM:** "Roll. You have Advantage from *Elevated*."

**Ally rolls 18 (Full Success).**

**GM:** "Arrow hits clean. Mercenary's resolve clock ticks to 3/4. He's wounded
and now *Exposed* (lost his cover position)."

**Round 3—You (behind Solid Cover):**

**You:** "He's *Exposed* and wounded. I lean out and Strike. Do I have Advantage
from him being *Exposed*?"

**GM:** "Yes—*Exposed* grants attackers Advantage. Roll with Advantage."

**You roll 17 with Advantage (Full Success).**

**GM:** "You drop him. Resolve clock fills—he's out. Warehouse quiet now."

**Analysis:** Tags (*Cramped*, *Fragile vs. Solid Cover*, *Elevated*) and
conditions (*Suppressed*, *Exposed*) shaped every choice. You cleared *Suppressed*
by repositioning. Ally used *Elevated* for Advantage. You capitalized on *Exposed*
to finish the fight. Status drove tactics.
