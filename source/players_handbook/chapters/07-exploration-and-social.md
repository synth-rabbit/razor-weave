# Exploration & Social Play {#ph-exploration-social-play}

## Exploration Overview {#exploration-overview}

Exploration covers everything outside combat: investigating crime scenes,
navigating dangerous terrain, deciphering ancient texts, picking locks,
tracking suspects, or solving puzzles. You use the same mechanics—DCs,
outcome tiers, tags, clocks—but the focus shifts from immediate violence to
problem-solving, discovery, and momentum building. The GM frames stakes, you
declare actions, you roll, and the fiction moves forward.

## Investigation & Discovery {#investigation--discovery}

When investigating, describe what you're doing and seeking. "I search the
desk for hidden compartments" or "I interview witnesses for inconsistencies."

The GM sets a DC based on how well-hidden or complex the information is. On
Full, you find clear evidence or breakthrough. On Partial, you find something
useful with a complication—time passes, someone notices, clue incomplete. On
Fail, learn nothing new or trigger a complication.

**Progress Clocks** track investigation goals: "Identify Culprit" or "Decode
Ritual." Successful checks tick progress. Fill the clock, achieve
breakthrough. **Pressure Clocks** track danger: "Guards Return" or "Evidence
Destroyed." Partial/Fail tick pressure, raising stakes.

Use relevant skills—Perception for details, Research for lore, Insight for
reading people. The GM might grant Advantage for expert tools, contacts, or
prep time.

## Social Interaction {#social-interaction}

Social scenes—persuasion, deception, negotiation—use the same structure.
Declare intent and approach. "I convince the merchant to lower his price by
appealing to shared history" or "I deceive the guard by forging confidence."

**Persuasion:** On Full, change their mind or gain trust. On Partial, they're
swayed but want something in return. On Fail, they reject or grow suspicious.

**Deception:** On Full, they believe you. On Partial, they believe but doubt
a detail or ask follow-ups. On Fail, they see through the lie.

**Reading NPCs:** Use Insight to read intentions, detect lies, gauge mood. On
Full, GM tells what they want and hide. On Partial, partial read or they
notice you studying them.

**Social Contests:** When both have goals (debate, negotiation), both roll.
Higher wins. GM pre-states outcomes for each side. Use when neither dominates.

### Negotiation Tactics {#negotiation-tactics}

Negotiation is about finding leverage and reading the room. Effective
negotiators identify what the other party values, then frame their offer to
align with those values.

**Identify Leverage:** Before negotiating, use Insight to read the NPC's
priorities. Are they *Profit-Minded*? Offer ongoing revenue. *Honor-Bound*?
Appeal to duty or reputation. *Desperate*? Offer immediate relief. Leverage
isn't always gold—information, access, or protection can be more valuable.

**Frame Your Offer:** Present your proposal in terms of their goals, not
yours. Don't say "I need safe passage"—say "You get steady intel on caravans
if you let us through." Make it easy for them to say yes by showing mutual
benefit.

**Multi-Round Negotiations:** Complex negotiations unfold over multiple rolls.
Use progress clocks to track "Deal Secured" or "Trust Established." Each round
represents an exchange: you make an offer, they counter, you adapt. Winning
early rounds grants Advantage later (they're more receptive). Losing early
rounds means you're negotiating uphill—you'll need bigger concessions or better
leverage to recover.

**When to Walk Away:** Not every negotiation succeeds. If the NPC's demands
are unreasonable or their terms unacceptable, walking away is valid. Sometimes
failed negotiation creates new opportunities—rival factions, alternative
routes, or leverage to revisit the deal later with better position.

### Deception and Lying {#deception-and-lying}

Deception is high-risk, high-reward. Successful lies open doors, failed lies
burn bridges and create enemies.

**Craft Believable Lies:** Simple lies work better than complex ones. "I'm
lost" is easier to sell than "I'm the duke's secret envoy carrying urgent
correspondence." Ground lies in partial truths—real details mixed with
fabrication are harder to spot. The GM may grant Advantage if your lie aligns
with observable facts.

**Commitment:** Once you commit to a lie, maintain it. Contradicting yourself
or hesitating raises suspicion. If an NPC asks follow-up questions (Partial
Success consequence), have answers ready. Improvise details that support the
fiction you've created.

**Failed Deception:** When a lie fails, consequences compound. The NPC doesn't
just reject the lie—they remember you lied. Future social interactions with
them may face Disadvantage (*Distrusted* tag). Groups talk—lying to one guard
might poison your reputation with the entire faction. Weigh the risk: is the
potential gain worth permanently damaging trust?

**Alternatives to Lying:** Consider misdirection, selective truth, or
omission. You don't have to lie outright—letting them assume something false
is often safer than active deception. "I'm here to see someone" (true) lets
them assume you have legitimate business (false assumption, their error).

## Using Tools & Resources {#using-tools--resources}

Outside combat, you can spend resources to shift position:

**Gear:** Expert tools (lockpicks, climbing gear, medical kit) grant
Advantage or reduce DCs. Improvised tools impose Disadvantage.

**Time:** Spending extra time grants Advantage on investigation, crafting, or
preparation. Rushing imposes Disadvantage.

**Contacts & Favors:** Call in a contact for information, access, or
assistance. The GM might grant Advantage or tick a progress clock directly.
Using favors has costs—you owe them, or they ask for something in return.

Tell the GM what you're spending and how it helps. They'll decide if it
grants Advantage, reduces the DC, or bypasses the check entirely.

## Pacing & Momentum {#pacing--momentum}

Exploration and social scenes use clocks and tags for structure:

**Clocks** pace progress and pressure. "Locate Safehouse" (progress) vs.
"Hunters Close In" (pressure). Clocks make abstract goals concrete—see
progress accumulating and danger mounting.

**Tags** describe environmental or situational states. *Crowded Market* grants
Advantage to blend but Disadvantage to chase. *Dim Archives* makes research
harder but offers privacy. *Suspicious Guards* raises DCs in that area. GM
names tags; you decide how to use or avoid.

Between action and consequence, fiction breathes. GM describes what changed,
you react, momentum carries forward.

## Worked Examples {#worked-examples}

### Example 1: Investigation (Searching a Crime Scene) {#example-1-investigation}

**You:** "I search the office for evidence—letters, bloodstains, anything
that points to the killer."

**GM:** "DC 14. The room's ransacked (*Disorganized* tag—Disadvantage). Full
means you find a key letter. Partial means you find something but knock over
a lamp—pressure ticks. Roll Perception."

**You roll 16—Full.**

**GM:** "Beneath papers you find a sealed letter with the rival house's crest.
Progress clock 'Identify Culprit' ticks to 2/4. What now?"

### Example 2: Social (Negotiating with a Merchant) {#example-2-social}

**You:** "I want to convince the merchant to sell us the map at a fair price
by pointing out we're his best chance to recover stolen goods."

**GM:** "She's skeptical but listening. DC 16. Partial means she agrees but
wants a cut of what you recover. Roll Presence."

**You roll 14—Partial.**

**GM:** "She leans back. 'Fine. Fifty silver for the map, but I want ten
percent of any treasure you find using it.' Do you agree, or push back?"

**You:** "I'll take it. We shake on it."

Both examples show intent, approach, DC, outcomes, and how the fiction moves
forward. Investigation used clocks; social used trade-offs. Same mechanics,
different context.

## Social Contest Examples {#social-contest-examples}

Social contests occur when both sides have clear, conflicting goals and
neither dominates. Both roll, and the higher result wins. The GM pre-states
outcomes before rolls to clarify stakes.

### Contest 1: Debate (Public Forum) {#debate-public-forum}

**Setup:** You're debating the town council over resource allocation. They
want to fortify the walls; you want to fund the healer's guild. The crowd is
listening (*Divided Audience* tag—no inherent Advantage).

**Round 1—Opening Arguments:**

**You:** "I appeal to compassion—remind them we lost three families to plague
last winter while the walls stood untouched."

**GM:** "The council speaker counters that walls saved them from raiders last
summer. Both roll Presence. Winner sways the crowd—progress clock ticks toward
their goal. Full means strong sway, Partial means weak sway but you expose a
weakness in your argument."

**You roll 18 (Presence +3 = 21).**

**Council Speaker rolls 16 (Presence +2 = 18).**

**GM:** "You win this exchange. Your words hit home—several council members nod.
Progress clock 'Sway Council' ticks to 1/4. But the Speaker isn't done."

**Round 2—Rebuttals:**

**Council Speaker:** "The Speaker pivots—'Compassion is noble, but raiders
killed six families two years ago. Dead healers can't help anyone.'"

**GM:** "He's using fear now. Both roll Presence again. Winner consolidates
their position. If you win, tick progress. If he wins, he ticks his clock
'Maintain Status Quo.'"

**You roll 14 (Presence +3 = 17).**

**Council Speaker rolls 19 (Presence +2 = 21).**

**GM:** "He wins. The crowd murmurs agreement—fear is powerful. His clock ticks
to 1/4. The crowd is split now. You need a stronger approach."

**Round 3—Final Appeals:**

**You:** "I call on a healer from the crowd to testify about preventable deaths.
I'm using my Compassion proficiency to grant myself Advantage."

**GM:** "Bold move. You have Advantage. Winner takes the debate—fills their
clock to 4/4 or gets 3/4 ticks. Loser gets nothing."

**You roll 20 (with Advantage, Presence +3 = 23).**

**Council Speaker rolls 15 (Presence +2 = 17).**

**GM:** "The healer's testimony breaks through. Several council members wipe
their eyes. Your clock fills to 4/4. The council votes to fund the healer's
guild first, then consider walls later. You won."

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Multiple rounds** let both sides build arguments and react.
- **Progress clocks** track who's winning the crowd's favor.
- **Advantage from proficiencies or allies** (healer testimony) can turn the
  tide.
- **Stakes were clear:** Council funding priorities, not life-or-death but
  meaningful to characters and community.

### Contest 2: Interrogation (Extracting Information) {#interrogation}

**Setup:** You're interrogating a captured smuggler. He knows where the
shipment is hidden, but he's loyal to his boss (*Loyal* tag—Disadvantage to
intimidation). You need the location before his crew realizes he's missing.
Pressure clock "Crew Realizes" starts at 0/4.

**Round 1—Intimidation vs. Resolve:**

**You:** "I slam my fist on the table and lean in—'Tell me where the shipment
is, or you'll rot in the duke's dungeon.'"

**GM:** "He's scared but loyal. You roll Presence (intimidation). He rolls
Resolve. Winner controls the exchange. If you win, he cracks—reveals partial
info and you tick progress. If he wins, he holds firm, and pressure ticks
(crew is looking for him)."

**You roll 16 (Presence +2 = 18).**

**Smuggler rolls 17 (Resolve +3 = 20).**

**GM:** "He spits at your feet. 'I don't talk to thugs.' He's tougher than he
looks. Pressure ticks to 1/4—his crew is starting to ask where he went. Try
something else."

**Round 2—Deception vs. Insight:**

**You:** "I change tactics—'Look, your boss left you to hang. He's already
selling the shipment and keeping your cut. I can protect you if you cooperate.'"

**GM:** "You're lying, but he doesn't know that. You roll Presence (deception).
He rolls Insight. Winner controls the narrative. If you win, he believes you
and reveals the location. If he wins, he sees through it and shuts down
completely."

**You roll 19 (Presence +2 = 21).**

**Smuggler rolls 12 (Insight +1 = 13).**

**GM:** "His face falls. 'He... left me? That bastard.' He tells you the
shipment is hidden in the old mill by the river. You got what you needed."

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Different approaches** (intimidation vs. deception) use different skills.
  Adapt when one fails.
- **Pressure clock** added time urgency—failure has escalating costs.
- **NPC traits** (*Loyal* tag) shaped difficulty—intimidation faced
  Disadvantage, but deception exploited his loyalty (betrayal hurts more when
  you're loyal).
- **Stakes escalated:** First round was "does he crack," second was "can you
  trick him before time runs out."

### Contest 3: Negotiation (Multi-Party Stakes) {#negotiation-multi-party}

**Setup:** You're negotiating safe passage through gang territory. The gang
leader (*Ruthless*, *Profit-Minded* tags) wants payment. You want free passage
and future access. A rival merchant is also bidding for the gang's favor.

**Round 1—Establishing Value:**

**You:** "I offer information about a merchant convoy passing through next
week—worth more than gold if they move fast."

**Rival Merchant:** "I offer 200 gold now, no strings."

**GM:** "Both roll Presence. The gang leader picks the better deal based on
rolls and fiction. Winner gets Advantage in the next round (gang leader is
inclined toward them)."

**You roll 17 (Presence +2 = 19).**

**Rival Merchant rolls 14 (Presence +3 = 17).**

**GM:** "The leader leans forward. 'Information... that could be worth five
convoys if I play it right.' He's interested. You have Advantage next round."

**Round 2—Sealing the Deal:**

**You (with Advantage):** "I sweeten it—offer to split the convoy haul 60/40
in his favor, plus guaranteed intel on future shipments."

**Rival Merchant:** "I raise to 300 gold and throw in a crate of weapons."

**GM:** "Final bids. Both roll Presence. Winner secures the deal. Loser is out."

**You roll 20 (with Advantage, Presence +2 = 22).**

**Rival Merchant rolls 18 (Presence +3 = 21).**

**GM:** "The leader grins. 'Ongoing profit beats one-time gold. You've got a
deal, friend.' He offers his hand. The rival merchant storms out, furious."

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Competing interests** (you vs. rival merchant) create three-way tension.
- **Multiple rounds** let you build value and respond to competition.
- **Fiction matters:** Your offer (future profit) aligned with his
  *Profit-Minded* tag, giving you a narrative edge even though the merchant
  had higher Presence.
- **Advantage from winning Round 1** made the difference in Round 2.

### Contest 4: Fast-Talk (Escaping Suspicion) {#fast-talk}

**Setup:** You're caught sneaking through a noble's estate. A guard
confronts you (*Suspicious*, *By-the-Book* tags). You need to talk your way
out before he calls reinforcements. Pressure clock "Guards Arrive" starts at
0/4.

**You:** "I immediately act indignant—'I'm Lady Elowen's assistant! She sent me
to retrieve her correspondence. How dare you question me!'"

**GM:** "He's uncertain. You roll Presence (deception). He rolls Insight. Winner
controls the situation. If you win, he buys it and lets you go. If he wins, he
sees through it and calls for backup—pressure ticks to 3/4 immediately."

**You roll 13 (Presence +2 = 15).**

**Guard rolls 16 (Insight +2 = 18).**

**GM:** "He narrows his eyes. 'Lady Elowen's assistant would know she's out of
town.' He raises his whistle. Pressure ticks to 3/4. You've got one more chance
before guards flood the hall."

**You:** "I change tactics—'Fine, you caught me. I'm here for a different
reason. Let me show you something valuable.' I offer a bribe (50 gold) and use
Streetwise proficiency for Advantage."

**GM:** "Now you're appealing to greed. You have Advantage. You roll Presence
(persuasion). He rolls Resolve. If you win, he pockets the gold and pretends he
didn't see you. If he loses, he takes the gold AND calls the guards (he's
*By-the-Book* but not immune to greed). Stakes are high."

**You roll 18 (with Advantage, Presence +2 = 20).**

**Guard rolls 14 (Resolve +1 = 15).**

**GM:** "He looks at the gold, then at you. He pockets it. 'I didn't see
anyone. You have two minutes to disappear.' You sprint for the exit."

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Failed first round** escalated stakes but didn't end the contest.
- **Adapting approach** (deception → bribery) changed the dynamic.
- **NPC traits** (*By-the-Book*) made deception harder, but greed was a
  universal lever.
- **Pressure clock** created urgency—every round mattered.
- **Risk/reward:** Offering bribe could have backfired (lose gold AND get
  caught), but it was your best remaining option.

## Extended Exploration Examples {#extended-exploration-examples}

These examples show multi-step exploration scenarios with clocks, environmental
challenges, and problem-solving.

### Investigation: The Poisoned Heir {#investigation-poisoned-heir}

**Setup:** The duke's son has been poisoned. You have until dawn to identify
the culprit before the assassins flee the city. Progress clock "Identify
Assassin" (0/6). Pressure clock "Assassins Flee" (0/4, ticks each scene).

**Scene 1—Crime Scene Investigation:**

**You:** "I examine the heir's chambers for evidence—poison vials, signs of
forced entry, anything unusual."

**GM:** "The room is luxurious but chaotic (*Ransacked* tag—Disadvantage to
search). DC 16, Perception. Full means you find key evidence and tick progress
twice. Partial means you find something but waste time—pressure ticks."

**You roll 18 (Perception +3 = 21)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "Under the bed you find a shattered vial with a distinctive seal—House
Vyreth's personal apothecary. Progress ticks to 2/6. The heir's window is
slightly ajar—someone left in a hurry. What now?"

**Scene 2—Interviewing Witnesses:**

**You:** "I question the guards who were on duty. Who entered the heir's
chambers tonight?"

**GM:** "The guards are nervous (*Evasive* tag—they fear punishment). DC 15,
Insight to read whether they're hiding something or just scared. Partial means
they reveal some truth but you have to press them—pressure ticks."

**You roll 13 (Insight +2 = 15)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "The senior guard cracks: 'A servant brought wine at midnight. I didn't
recognize her, but she had the seal—I thought she was legitimate.' Progress
ticks to 3/6. You have a description now: hooded, slight build, moves quickly."

**Scene 3—Tracking the Assassin:**

**You:** "I head to House Vyreth's apothecary to confront them about the vial."

**GM:** "It's late, but lights are on. The apothecary is burning records
(*Panicked* tag—Advantage to intimidate). DC 14, Presence (intimidation) to
make them talk before they finish. Fail means they destroy evidence—progress
lost."

**You roll 16 (Presence +1 = 17)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "You burst in. The apothecary drops the ledger into the fire but you
snatch it. Inside: recent sale to 'Lady Mirelle'—the duchess's rival. Progress
ticks to 5/6. Pressure ticks to 2/4—assassins are preparing to flee."

**Scene 4—Confronting the Culprit:**

**You:** "I rush to Lady Mirelle's estate and demand entry, waving the ledger."

**GM:** "Her guards block you (*Loyal* tag—Disadvantage to intimidate). But
you have hard evidence. DC 17, Presence (persuasion or intimidation) to get
past them. Partial means they let you in but alert Mirelle—she has time to
prepare her defense."

**You roll 19 (Presence +1 = 20)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "The guards step aside, cowed by the evidence. You find Mirelle in her
study, already packing. She freezes when she sees you. Progress ticks to 6/6.
Clock complete—you've identified and cornered the assassin before dawn. The
duke's guards arrive to arrest her."

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Multiple scenes** build toward goal through progress clock
- **Pressure clock** creates time urgency across scenes
- **Environmental tags** modify difficulty and create tactical choices
- **Full vs. Partial** outcomes affect pacing—Full advances faster, Partial
  adds complications
- **Adaptation** required—each scene used different approach (search,
  interview, intimidate, persuade)

### Discovery: Exploring the Sunken Temple {#discovery-sunken-temple}

**Setup:** You're exploring a flooded temple rumored to hold an ancient
artifact. Progress clock "Find Artifact" (0/6). Pressure clock "Temple
Collapses" (0/4, ticks when you disturb structure).

**Scene 1—Navigating Flooded Corridors:**

**You:** "I wade through the water, searching for passages that lead deeper."

**GM:** "The temple is dark and waterlogged (*Low Visibility*, *Unstable
Footing* tags—Disadvantage to Perception and Athletics). DC 15, Perception to
find a safe route. Fail means you disturb rubble—pressure ticks."

**You roll 12 (Perception +3 = 15)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "You spot a corridor with relatively intact stonework. Progress ticks
to 1/6. As you wade forward, you hear distant groaning—the structure is
unstable. Proceed carefully."

**Scene 2—Deciphering Ancient Murals:**

**You:** "I examine the murals on the walls. Do they show where the artifact
is kept?"

**GM:** "The murals are faded (*Worn Carvings* tag—Disadvantage). DC 18,
Research (ancient lore) to interpret them. Partial means you get a clue but
misread a warning—pressure ticks."

**You roll 14 (Research +4 = 18)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "The murals depict a ritual chamber on the lowest level, guarded by
'the Keeper.' Progress ticks to 3/6. You also notice warnings about 'the water
that does not sleep'—something lives here."

**Scene 3—Bypassing the Guardian Statue:**

**You:** "I reach a chamber with a massive stone guardian blocking the path.
Can I climb around it or find a mechanism to move it?"

**GM:** "The statue's eyes glow faintly—it's warded (*Magical Sentinel* tag).
DC 16, Technical (Arcane Lore or Engineering) to disable it. Fail means it
activates—you'll have to fight or flee, and pressure ticks heavily."

**You roll 15 (Technical +2 = 17)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "You identify the warding sigil and trace a counter-pattern in the
water. The glow fades. Progress ticks to 4/6. The passage beyond descends into
murky darkness."

**Scene 4—The Flooded Ritual Chamber:**

**You:** "I dive into the chamber, searching for the artifact."

**GM:** "It's fully submerged (*Underwater* tag—Disadvantage to everything, and
you're holding your breath). DC 17, Perception to spot the artifact quickly.
Partial means you find it but something disturbs you—pressure ticks and you
might face a threat."

**You roll 16 (Perception +3 = 19)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "You spot the artifact on a pedestal—glowing faintly. You grab it and
kick toward the surface. Progress ticks to 6/6. The temple shudders violently
as you surface. You sprint for the exit as water surges behind you. You emerge
just as the entrance collapses. You made it—artifact in hand."

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Environmental tags** create escalating challenges (low visibility →
  underwater → collapsing)
- **Pressure clock** represents structural instability, not enemies
- **Skill diversity** required (Perception, Research, Technical)—generalists
  shine here
- **Success pacing** controlled by DC difficulty and progress clock size
- **Failure consequences** clear at each step—creates meaningful tension

### Tracking: The Smuggler's Trail {#tracking-smugglers-trail}

**Setup:** You're tracking a smuggling crew through wilderness to their hidden
camp. Progress clock "Locate Camp" (0/4). Pressure clock "Smugglers Spot You"
(0/4, ticks if you fail checks or make noise).

**Scene 1—Finding the Trail:**

**You:** "I search for tracks leaving the town—wagon ruts, footprints, anything
that shows which way they went."

**GM:** "The ground is muddy from recent rain (*Soft Terrain* tag—Advantage to
tracking). DC 13, Survival. Full means clear trail, progress ticks. Partial
means you find it but lose time—pressure ticks."

**You roll 15 (Survival +2 = 17)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "Deep wagon ruts lead west into the forest. Progress ticks to 1/4. The
tracks are fresh—they passed through within the hour."

**Scene 2—Silent Pursuit:**

**You:** "I follow the trail quietly, staying hidden in case they have scouts."

**GM:** "The forest is dense (*Heavy Cover* tag—Advantage to Stealth). DC 14,
Stealth to stay undetected. Fail means they hear you—pressure ticks to 3/4
immediately and they set an ambush."

**You roll 18 (Stealth +3 = 21)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "You move like a shadow. Progress ticks to 2/4. Ahead, you hear
voices—you're close."

**Scene 3—Scouting the Camp:**

**You:** "I creep to the edge of their camp and observe. How many are there?
What are they guarding?"

**GM:** "The camp is busy (*Crowded*, *Alert Sentries* tags—Disadvantage to
Perception). DC 16 to count enemies and spot the cargo without being seen.
Partial means you get some info but a sentry glances your way—pressure ticks."

**You roll 13 (Perception +3 = 16)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "Six smugglers, two on watch. The cargo: crates marked with noble
seals—stolen goods. Progress ticks to 4/4. You've located the camp and
gathered intel. Pressure clock at 0/4 still—they don't know you're here. Do
you retreat to report, or act now?"

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Progression through stages**: Find trail → Follow quietly → Scout camp
- **Pressure clock** tracks detection risk, not time
- **Environmental tags shift** (Soft Terrain → Heavy Cover → Crowded)—each
  scene has different tactical considerations
- **Information gathering** as goal, not just "find the place"
- **Player choice** at end—success creates options (report, ambush, negotiate)

### Problem-Solving: The Locked Archive {#problem-solving-locked-archive}

**Setup:** You need to retrieve a document from a noble's archive before
morning. Progress clock "Retrieve Document" (0/4). Pressure clock "Guards
Patrol Returns" (0/4, ticks each scene or on Partial/Fail).

**Scene 1—Bypassing the Lock:**

**You:** "I examine the archive door. It's a complex mechanical lock. Can I
pick it?"

**GM:** "It's a high-quality lock (*Master Craftsman* tag—Disadvantage). DC 17,
Technical (Security). Partial means you open it but it takes time—pressure
ticks."

**You roll 14 (Technical +4 = 18)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "Your lockpicks find the tumblers. The door opens silently. Progress
ticks to 1/4. Inside: rows of shelves in dim light."

**Scene 2—Navigating the Archive:**

**You:** "I search for the document—'Contract of House Verath, dated 15 years
ago.' Where would that be filed?"

**GM:** "The archive uses an old filing system (*Archaic Organization*
tag—Disadvantage to Research). DC 15, Research. Fail means you waste time and
make noise—pressure ticks twice."

**You roll 16 (Research +2 = 18)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "You decipher the system: contracts are filed by house, chronologically.
Progress ticks to 2/4. You locate the Verath section—third shelf from the top."

**Scene 3—Retrieving the Document:**

**You:** "I climb up carefully to retrieve the contract."

**GM:** "The shelf is high and old (*Unstable Furniture* tag). DC 13, Athletics
to climb without knocking things over. Fail means loud crash—pressure ticks to
4/4 immediately (guards investigate)."

**You roll 15 (Athletics +1 = 16)—Full Success.**

**GM:** "You scale the shelf like a cat, retrieve the contract, and descend.
Progress ticks to 4/4. You have the document. Pressure at 0/4 still—guards
haven't noticed. Time to leave."

**You:** "I exit the same way I came, locking the door behind me so they don't
notice the break-in."

**GM:** "Smart. You relock the door (no check needed—you already proved your
skill). You slip into the night with the contract. Mission accomplished without
raising alarm."

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Layered challenges**: Lock → Navigation → Retrieval → Escape
- **Different skills** for each obstacle (Technical, Research, Athletics)
- **Pressure clock** represents time limit and detection risk combined
- **Full Success pacing** allows smooth heist when player succeeds consistently
- **Optional choice** to relock door shows player agency (could rush, or be
  thorough)
