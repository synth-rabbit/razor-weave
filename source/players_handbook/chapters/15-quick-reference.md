- **DC 12 (Easy):** Good position with time and tools
- **DC 14 (Routine):** Standard challenge, normal conditions
- **DC 16 (Tough):** Notable obstacles, poor angle, time pressure
- **DC 18 (Hard):** Steep odds, strong opposition, tight timing
- **DC 20 (Heroic):** Exceptional challenge, stacked complications

### Outcomes {#outcomes}

- **Full Success:** Achieve your goal cleanly; progress ticks, gain position
- **Partial Success:** Achieve goal with complication; cost or pressure
- **Failure:** Don't achieve goal; situation escalates or new problem emerges
- **Critical (Nat 20):** Amplified success
- **Critical (Nat 1):** Amplified complication

## Your Turn {#your-turn}

**Order Options:**

- **Conversational:** GM asks "Who acts?" and rotates spotlight
- **Popcorn:** You act, then name who goes next (alternate sides)

**On Your Turn:**

1. Describe your action (Strike, Maneuver, Set Up, Defend/Withdraw)
2. GM sets DC and pre-states outcomes
3. Roll and add modifiers
4. GM narrates result and updates state

## Common Tags & Conditions {#common-tags--conditions}

### Tags (Environmental/Situational) {#tags-environmental-situational}

- **Dim Light:** Advantage to stealth; Disadvantage to ranged attacks/navigation
- **Slick:** Disadvantage on maneuvers and movement
- **Cramped:** Hinders movement; increases fall risk
- **Fragile Cover:** Grants Advantage but degrades on Partial
- **Solid Cover:** Reliable protection
- **Elevated:** Advantage on ranged attacks; forces opponents to climb
- **Crowded:** Advantage to blend in; Disadvantage to chase

### Conditions (Character States) {#conditions-character-states}

- **Exhausted:** Reduce effectiveness until rest/aid

- **Stunned:** Can't act next turn
- **Suppressed:** Disadvantage on next action

## Action Cheat Sheet {#action-cheat-sheet}

**Strike:** Attack opponent. Full = damage/pressure. Partial = connect but
take cost. Fail = they counter or you lose position.

**Maneuver:** Shove, trip, disarm, reposition. Full = achieve goal. Partial =
trade something. Use to create openings or control space.

**Set Up:** Create advantage for self or allies. Full = grant Advantage or
apply helpful tag. Partial = create advantage but expose yourself.

**Defend/Withdraw:** Change position to safety, clear condition, break
contact. Full = reposition and clear minor tag. Partial = move but give up
next action.

## Investigation & Social Quick Reference {#investigation--social-quick-reference}

**Investigation:** Describe what you're doing and seeking. Full = clear
evidence. Partial = useful info with complication. Fail = nothing new or
trigger complication. Use Progress/Pressure clocks.

**Persuasion:** Full = change mind/gain trust. Partial = swayed but want
something. Fail = reject or grow suspicious.

**Deception:** Full = believe you. Partial = believe but doubt detail. Fail =
see through lie.

**Reading NPCs:** Use Insight. Full = learn wants and secrets. Partial =
partial read or they notice.

**Social Contests:** Both roll when both have goals. Higher wins. GM
pre-states outcomes.
