# Downtime & Recovery {#ph-downtime-recovery}



## Downtime Overview {#downtime-overview}

**Downtime** represents time between adventures: days, weeks, or months when
you're not in immediate danger. Use it to recover, train, pursue projects, and
build connections.

Downtime bridges story arcs, gives your character space to grow, and creates
opportunities for personal goals beyond the main plot.

## Recovery & Rest {#recovery--rest}

**Healing:** Extended rest clears most injuries and conditions. The GM
determines how much time you need based on severity.

**Clearing Conditions:** Rest removes *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*, and similar
conditions. Severe conditions (*Poisoned*, *Cursed*) may require medical aid or
specialized treatment.

**Restoring Resources:** Replenish gear, contacts, and narrative resources.
Re-stock supplies, repair equipment, and rebuild spent favors.

Rest is the default recovery method. Specific conditions may require more.

## Downtime Activities {#downtime-activities}

Downtime activities let you invest time in goals beyond immediate adventures. Each activity requires time (days to weeks), may involve checks, and produces tangible results.

### Training {#training}

**What It Does:** Learn new skills, improve proficiencies, or expand your capabilities through practice or instruction.

**Time Required:** 1-4 weeks depending on complexity

**Mechanical Effects:**
- **Skill Training**: Work toward gaining a new skill from an adjacent package (requires GM approval and narrative justification)
- **Proficiency Refinement**: Deepen expertise in an existing proficiency, potentially unlocking new narrative permissions
- **Attribute Conditioning**: Rare; intensive training might contribute to attribute improvement at major milestones

**How It Works:** Describe what you're training in and why. The GM sets a progress clock (typically 4-6 segments). Each week of training, roll relevant attribute + training focus (RSN for studying, MIG for physical conditioning, etc.) vs. DC 13. Full Success ticks 2 segments, Partial ticks 1. Fill the clock to complete training.

**Example:**

**You:** "I want to train with the retired duelist, Master Valen, to learn Blades."

**GM:** "Valen agrees to teach you. Progress clock 'Learn Blades' (0/6). You have 4 weeks before the next adventure. Roll RSN or AGI each week, DC 13."

**Week 1:** Roll 15 (Full Success) → Progress 2/6
**Week 2:** Roll 12 (Partial Success) → Progress 3/6
**Week 3:** Roll 16 (Full Success) → Progress 5/6
**Week 4:** Roll 14 (Full Success) → Progress 7/6 (Complete!)

**GM:** "You've mastered the basics. Add Blades skill. Valen invites you to spar with his advanced students—potential future connection."

### Research {#research}

**What It Does:** Investigate mysteries, study ancient texts, gather intelligence, or learn specialized knowledge.

**Time Required:** Days to weeks depending on obscurity

**Mechanical Effects:**
- **Knowledge Gain**: Learn crucial information (villain's weakness, ritual requirements, historical context)
- **Advantages**: Gain narrative Advantage on future related checks ("I researched this cult's symbols")
- **Story Hooks**: Uncover leads, plot threads, or complications

**How It Works:** State your research goal and method (library, interview experts, fieldwork). GM sets a progress clock based on how obscure the information is. Each research session, roll RSN + Research vs. DC (12-18). Full Success ticks progress and may reveal bonus info. Partial Success ticks progress but introduces complications (wrong lead, unwanted attention). Fail might waste time or alert interested parties.

**Example:**

**You:** "I research the Crimson Hand cult in the city archives. What's their origin and current activity?"

**GM:** "Progress clock 'Crimson Hand Research' (0/4). DC 15. Partial means you find info but someone notices your interest."

**Session 1:** Roll 18 (Full Success) → Progress 2/4. "You find records of their founding—50 years ago, a rogue mage. They're active in the docks."

**Session 2:** Roll 13 (Partial Success) → Progress 3/4. "You find recent activity reports, but a librarian sees what you're reading and looks concerned. They slip you a note: 'They're watching.'"

**Session 3:** Roll 16 (Full Success) → Progress 5/4 (Complete!). "You compile a dossier: Their current leader is 'The Veiled One,' they operate from a warehouse, and they're smuggling arcane components. You gain Advantage on future checks to infiltrate or confront them."

### Crafting {#crafting}

**What It Does:** Create gear, modify equipment, brew potions, or forge tools.

**Time Required:** Days to weeks depending on item complexity

**Mechanical Effects:**
- **Useful Gear**: Create items with narrative permissions (lockpicks, climbing gear, poisons)
- **Custom Equipment**: Modify existing gear (reinforce armor, add weapon feature)
- **Consumables**: Brew potions, craft ammunition, prepare explosives

**How It Works:** Describe what you want to create. GM sets a progress clock and resource cost (materials, workshop access). Roll Technical + relevant skill (Engineering, Medicine for potions, etc.) vs. DC (12-18). Full Success ticks progress efficiently. Partial Success ticks progress but wastes materials or takes longer. Fail might ruin materials or create a flawed product.

**Example:**

**You:** "I want to craft a grappling hook launcher—lets me scale buildings quickly."

**GM:** "Progress clock 'Grappling Launcher' (0/4). Costs 50 gold in materials. DC 14 Technical. Partial means you burn materials (additional 20 gold)."

**Week 1:** Roll 16 (Full Success) → Progress 2/4. "The trigger mechanism works perfectly."

**Week 2:** Roll 12 (Partial Success) → Progress 3/4. "The spring isn't right—you buy a stronger one (+20 gold)."

**Week 3:** Roll 17 (Full Success) → Progress 5/4 (Complete!). "It's done. Grappling launcher: Grants Advantage on climbing checks, can reach 30 feet."

### Social Networking {#social-networking}

**What It Does:** Build contacts, cultivate alliances, or gain influence with factions.

**Time Required:** 1-3 weeks per contact/faction

**Mechanical Effects:**
- **Contacts**: NPCs who provide information, favors, or access
- **Faction Standing**: Improve reputation with a group (guards, merchants, nobles)
- **Story Hooks**: Connections create opportunities and complications

**How It Works:** Describe who you're networking with and your approach (gifts, favors, shared interests). GM sets a progress clock (typically 4-6 segments). Roll Presence + Persuasion vs. DC (12-16). Full Success builds rapport quickly. Partial Success builds rapport but you owe a favor or reveal something. Fail might offend or waste their time.

**Example:**

**You:** "I want to build a contact in the city watch—someone who can warn me about investigations."

**GM:** "Progress clock 'City Watch Contact' (0/4). You meet Sergeant Kade at a tavern. DC 13 Presence."

**Week 1:** Roll 15 (Full Success) → Progress 2/4. "Kade appreciates your stories. You bond over shared dislike of corruption."

**Week 2:** Roll 11 (Partial Success) → Progress 3/4. "Kade warms to you but asks: 'If I tip you off, what's in it for me?' You owe a favor."

**Week 3:** Roll 16 (Full Success) → Progress 5/4 (Complete!). "Kade agrees to warn you about investigations if you help bust a smuggling ring. Contact established."

### Personal Projects {#personal-projects}

**What It Does:** Pursue character-specific goals tied to backstory, beliefs, or ambitions.

**Time Required:** Varies widely (weeks to months)

**Mechanical Effects:**
- **Narrative Closure**: Resolve character arcs or backstory threads
- **New Resources**: Establish safe houses, businesses, or strongholds
- **Character Growth**: Evolve motivations, relationships, or goals

**How It Works:** Propose your project. GM frames scope and sets a long-term progress clock (6-10 segments). Progress happens through downtime activities, side quests, or story events. Projects create narrative depth more than mechanical advantage.

**Example:**

**You:** "I want to establish a safe house network for refugees fleeing the war."

**GM:** "Progress clock 'Refugee Network' (0/8). You'll need safe locations, trustworthy contacts, and funding. We'll track progress as you complete related activities."

**Downtime 1:** You donate 200 gold and recruit a sympathetic merchant. Progress 2/8.

**Downtime 2:** Side quest—you rescue refugees from bandits. Progress 4/8.

**Downtime 3:** You negotiate with a noble for a property. Roll Persuasion, DC 15. Success → Progress 6/8.

**Downtime 4:** You formalize the network with local clergy. Progress 8/8 (Complete!). Network established: You can shelter allies, gather info from refugees, and have a meaningful legacy.

### Side Quests {#side-quests}

**What It Does:** Take on smaller missions during downtime—bounties, delivery jobs, investigation requests.

**Time Required:** Days to 1 week

**Mechanical Effects:**
- **Income**: Earn gold (typically 50-200 depending on danger)
- **Reputation**: Build standing with factions or contacts
- **Story Leads**: Uncover hooks for future adventures

**How It Works:** The GM presents opportunities or you propose ideas. Side quests are mini-adventures—typically 1-2 scenes with a conflict and resolution. Roll relevant skills as needed. Success earns rewards, failure brings complications but no catastrophic consequences.

**Example:**

**You:** "I take a bounty: track down a pickpocket who stole from the merchant guild."

**GM:** "100 gold reward. Scene 1: Track them (Perception, DC 14). Scene 2: Apprehend them (Combat or Persuasion, DC 15)."

**Scene 1:** Roll 16 (Full Success). "You track them to the docks. They're selling stolen goods."

**Scene 2:** Roll Persuasion 14 (Partial Success). "You convince them to return the goods, but they flee before you can bring them in. Merchant guild pays 75 gold (partial reward) and asks you to watch for them."

Side quests are lower stakes but still engaging. They fill time productively and keep your character active between major story arcs.

## NPC Relationships & Faction Standing {#npc-relationships-faction-standing}

Building relationships with NPCs and factions creates narrative depth, mechanical advantages, and story hooks. Relationships aren't just flavor—they provide access, information, and support when you need them.

### Relationship Mechanics {#relationship-mechanics}

**Relationship Levels:**
- **Stranger** (0): No connection, neutral stance
- **Acquaintance** (1): Recognize each other, willing to talk
- **Friend** (2): Trust and support, small favors
- **Ally** (3): Significant trust, major favors, risk themselves
- **Sworn** (4): Ride-or-die, sacrifice for you

**Building Relationships:** Progress through levels via social interactions, favors, shared experiences, and downtime activities. GM tracks relationship progress using clocks (typically 4 segments per level). Positive interactions tick progress; betrayals or conflicts tick a "Deterioration" clock.

**Relationship Benefits by Level:**

**Acquaintance:**
- Provide basic information ("I heard rumors about...")
- Small discounts or preferential treatment
- Warn you about obvious dangers

**Friend:**
- Share valuable information ("Here's what I know about the cult")
- Loan resources (gold, gear, access to locations)
- Introduce you to their contacts

**Ally:**
- Take risks for you (lie to authorities, provide alibis)
- Offer significant resources (safe house, armed backup)
- Go out of their way to help

**Sworn:**
- Sacrifice for you (take a hit, abandon their safety)
- Share deeply personal or dangerous secrets
- Stand by you even when it costs them everything

### Relationship Example: Building an Ally {#relationship-example}

**Setup:** You want Sergeant Kade (City Watch) to become an ally, not just a friend.

**Current Level:** Friend (2). Kade warns you about investigations and shares info.

**Goal:** Reach Ally (3). Kade will actively help you, even bending rules.

**Method:** Complete a major favor—help Kade bust a smuggling ring he's been tracking.

**GM:** "Progress clock 'Kade Becomes Ally' (0/4). You need to prove you're worth risking his career for."

**Downtime Actions:**
- **Week 1:** You research the smugglers (Research check, DC 15). Success → Progress 1/4.
- **Week 2:** You stake out the warehouse (Perception check, DC 14). Success → Progress 2/4.
- **Week 3:** You infiltrate and gather evidence (Stealth check, DC 16). Success → Progress 4/4 (Complete!).

**Result:** You hand Kade the evidence. He makes the bust, gets promoted, and tells you: "I owe you. Anything you need—within reason—I've got your back." **Kade is now an Ally (Level 3).**

**Benefits:** Kade can now provide search warrants, delay investigations, or mobilize guards for backup. He won't break the law outright, but he'll stretch it for you.

### Faction Standing {#faction-standing}

**Factions** are groups with shared goals—guilds, noble houses, criminal syndicates, religious orders. Your standing with them affects access, prices, and story opportunities.

**Standing Levels:**
- **Hostile** (-2): Attacked on sight, bounties on your head
- **Unfriendly** (-1): Refused service, high prices, suspicion
- **Neutral** (0): Default state, transactional interactions
- **Friendly** (+1): Discounts, favors, introductions
- **Honored** (+2): Major support, access to inner circles, defended by faction

**Changing Standing:** Complete jobs for the faction, donate resources, or advance their goals. Each significant action moves standing by 1 step (Neutral → Friendly, for example). Betrayals or opposition move standing down.

**Example:**

**Faction:** The Merchant Guild

**Current Standing:** Neutral (0). They'll trade with you at market prices.

**Action:** You recover stolen guild shipments worth 500 gold.

**GM:** "The guild master thanks you publicly. Standing shifts to Friendly (+1)."

**Benefits:** 10% discount on guild goods, introductions to wealthy merchants, invitations to guild events (social networking opportunities).

### Managing Multiple Relationships {#managing-multiple-relationships}

**Conflicting Loyalties:** When two contacts or factions oppose each other, you may need to choose sides or navigate carefully. Betraying one to help another damages the betrayed relationship.

**Maintenance:** Relationships require occasional interaction to maintain. If you ignore a friend for months, the GM may tick a "Neglect" clock. Fill it, and the relationship downgrades (Friend → Acquaintance).

**Example:**

**You:** "I haven't talked to Marcus (my researcher friend) in three months. Is he still helping me?"

**GM:** "Marcus feels ignored. Neglect clock (0/4) is at 3/4. If you don't reconnect soon, he'll downgrade to Acquaintance."

**You:** "I visit him and apologize, bringing his favorite wine."

**GM:** "He's hurt but forgives you. Neglect clock resets. Maintain contact or this happens again."

## Long-Term Projects & Campaign Integration {#long-term-projects-campaign-integration}

Long-term projects span multiple downtime periods and integrate with the campaign's story. They give you agency to shape the world beyond reacting to the GM's plot.

### Long-Term Project Framework {#long-term-project-framework}

**Step 1: Define Goal**
What do you want to create, achieve, or change? Be specific.

**Examples:**
- Establish a spy network in the capital
- Build a stronghold in the wilderness
- Write and publish a revolutionary manifesto
- Reconcile two warring factions

**Step 2: Set Progress Clock**
GM determines scope: 6-10 segments for major projects, 10-20 for epic ambitions.

**Step 3: Identify Milestones**
Break the project into phases. Each milestone represents a significant step.

**Example (Spy Network):**
- **Milestone 1** (0-3 segments): Recruit initial agents
- **Milestone 2** (4-6 segments): Establish safe houses and communication
- **Milestone 3** (7-10 segments): Infiltrate key institutions

**Step 4: Progress Through Play**
Progress happens via downtime activities, side quests, or main story events that align with your project.

**Step 5: Handle Setbacks**
Failures or complications may introduce a "Setback" clock. Fill it, and you lose progress or face a crisis.

### Long-Term Project Example: Building a Stronghold {#stronghold-example}

**Goal:** Establish a defensible base in the Wildlands where you and your allies can operate safely.

**Progress Clock:** "Wildlands Stronghold" (0/12)

**Milestones:**
- **Phase 1** (0-4): Secure land and clear immediate threats
- **Phase 2** (5-8): Construct basic fortifications
- **Phase 3** (9-12): Establish supply lines and defenses

**Downtime 1:** You negotiate with the local warlord for land rights. Roll Persuasion, DC 16. Success → Progress 2/12.

**Downtime 2:** You hire workers and begin construction. Cost: 500 gold. Progress 4/12 (Milestone 1 complete).

**Campaign Event:** During an adventure, bandits attack your construction site. You defend it. GM: "You've proven the site can be held. Progress 6/12."

**Downtime 3:** You establish a supply route with a friendly merchant. Roll Social Networking, DC 14. Success → Progress 8/12 (Milestone 2 complete).

**Downtime 4:** You fortify the walls and train guards. Cost: 300 gold. Progress 10/12.

**Campaign Event:** A rival faction attacks your stronghold. You repel them, proving its strategic value. Progress 12/12 (Complete!).

**Result:** Your stronghold is operational. Benefits:
- Safe haven for downtime activities
- Base of operations for regional adventures
- Source of story hooks (defending it, expanding influence)

### Campaign Integration Tips {#campaign-integration-tips}

**Coordinate with GM:** Discuss how your project fits the campaign. The GM might tie it to main story events or use it to create new plot threads.

**Accept Complications:** Projects rarely go smoothly. Rivals, resource shortages, and unexpected alliances make them interesting. Embrace setbacks as story opportunities.

**Share Spotlight:** If other players pursue projects, support them. Collaborative projects (shared stronghold, joint business) create party cohesion and shared stakes.

**Use Projects for Downtime:** Long-term projects give downtime purpose. Instead of "I rest for two weeks," you say "I advance my spy network while the party recovers."

## Working with Your GM {#working-with-your-gm}

**Propose your goals.** Tell the GM what you want to accomplish and why it
matters to your character.

**Negotiate scope.** The GM will frame what's feasible in the time available
and what costs or risks are involved.

**Roll when stakes matter.** Simple downtime actions (rest, routine training)
don't require rolls. Complex projects (rare research, dangerous networking) may
require checks.

Downtime is collaborative. Work with your GM to create meaningful opportunities.
