# Character Creation {#ph-character-creation}

Creating a character means building three interlocking layers: **concept** (who they are and what makes them compelling), **mechanical framework** (what they can do and how they engage with the game's systems), and **narrative hooks** (why they matter to the story and what pulls them into the action). This chapter walks you through that process step by step, with concrete examples and guidance for creating characters that feel both mechanically competent and dramatically engaging.

Character creation is fundamentally a collaborative act. You're not building a character in isolation—you're creating someone who will interact with other PCs, engage with the GM's world, and drive stories forward through their choices. Before you dive into mechanics, talk with your GM and fellow players about the campaign's themes, tone, and setting. Discuss what kind of stories your group wants to tell. A character built for gritty survival horror won't mesh well with a group playing heroic adventure fantasy. Alignment on expectations creates richer, more satisfying play.

Think of character creation as building the foundation for a living, evolving person. You're not writing their entire biography—you're establishing who they are *at the start* of the campaign. Play will reveal depths, contradictions, and growth you can't predict now. Start with a clear, evocative core and let the character develop through actual decisions at the table.

## Step 1: Concept & Attributes {#step-1-concept--attributes}

Start with **concept**: a short, evocative description of who this character is, what they do, and what drives them. Think in terms of character archetypes and roles, but give yours a specific twist or detail that makes them yours.

**Good concepts** are specific and actionable:
- "A street-smart investigator haunted by her missing partner"
- "A grizzled mercenary trying to retire peacefully but pulled back by old debts"
- "A brilliant but naive scholar uncovering secrets that powerful people want buried"

**Weak concepts** are vague or passive:
- "A fighter" (what kind? what motivates them?)
- "Someone who wants adventure" (too broad, no dramatic tension)
- "A person with magic powers" (no personality, no conflict)

Your concept should immediately suggest narrative possibilities. When you describe your character, the GM and other players should instantly see story hooks—relationships to build, conflicts to explore, goals to pursue.

Once you have your concept, translate it into **attributes**. Attributes are the four core capabilities that define your character's baseline competencies:

**MIG (Might):** Physical power, endurance, and resilience. Might governs lifting, smashing, enduring physical hardship, and resisting bodily harm. High Might characters are physically imposing—warriors, laborers, athletes, brawlers.

**AGI (Agility):** Speed, precision, and reflexes. Agility governs dodging, climbing, shooting, sleight of hand, and any action requiring finesse or quick reactions. High Agility characters are nimble and coordinated—thieves, scouts, duelists, acrobats.

**RSN (Reason):** Logic, knowledge, perception, and analytical thinking. Reason governs analyzing evidence, recalling information, noticing details, and solving problems through intellect. High Reason characters are sharp-minded—scholars, investigators, engineers, tacticians.

**PRE (Presence):** Charisma, willpower, and social influence. Presence governs persuading, commanding, intimidating, and resisting mental pressure. High Presence characters are compelling and forceful—leaders, diplomats, performers, con artists.

**Assigning Attribute Bonuses**

Your GM will tell you how to assign attribute bonuses. A common starting array is **+2, +1, +1, +0**—assign these four values to your four attributes in any order based on your concept.

**Example (Kira, the investigator):**
- **MIG +0**: Not physically imposing, relies on other tools
- **AGI +1**: Quick reflexes, good for tailing suspects and staying mobile
- **RSN +2**: Sharp analytical mind, her primary strength
- **PRE +1**: Socially competent, can talk her way into places

Attributes add directly to your `4d6` rolls. When you make a check, you roll `4d6`, sum all four dice, and add the relevant attribute bonus. If Kira makes a Deduction check (typically RSN-based), she rolls `4d6+2`. If she tries to intimidate someone (typically PRE-based), she rolls `4d6+1`.

Higher bonuses make success more likely, but they're not everything. A character with +0 in an attribute can still succeed through clever approaches, environmental advantage, or teamwork. Attributes establish your baseline, but play reveals how you *use* those capabilities.

## Step 2: Skills & Proficiencies {#step-2-skills--proficiencies}

**Skills** define what you're trained in—the specific areas where you excel beyond raw attributes. Instead of choosing individual skills piecemeal, you'll select a **skill package** that fits your concept and the campaign's genre.

Skill packages are thematic bundles designed for specific character archetypes and settings. For example:

**Fantasy Packages:**
- *Blades & Brawling*: Melee combat, intimidation, physical prowess
- *Arcane Lore*: Magic theory, ancient languages, mystical perception
- *Wilderness Survival*: Tracking, foraging, navigation, animal handling

**Modern Packages:**
- *Urban Investigation*: Research, surveillance, deduction, streetwise
- *Firearms & Tactics*: Shooting, combat tactics, military protocols
- *Social Engineering*: Persuasion, deception, reading people, networking

**Science Fiction Packages:**
- *Piloting & Navigation*: Starship operation, astrogation, zero-g maneuvering
- *Hacking & Systems*: Computer intrusion, electronic warfare, system analysis
- *Xenobiology*: Alien life study, exobotany, medical xenoscience

Each package gives you bonuses or advantage when using those skills. Consult your GM or the Mechanics Reference for complete skill lists and packages appropriate to your campaign's genre and setting.

**Proficiencies** grant narrative permissions and mechanical edges beyond skills. While skills govern *what you're trained in*, proficiencies define *what you can do that others can't* and *special advantages you bring*.

**Examples of Proficiencies:**
- **Master Duelist**: Advantage when fighting one-on-one in melee, narrative permission to challenge opponents to formal duels
- **Alchemist**: Can craft potions and identify compounds, narrative permission to have specialized alchemical equipment
- **Polyglot**: Speak and read multiple languages fluently, advantage on checks involving translation or linguistics
- **Tech Savant**: Advantage when working with unfamiliar technology, narrative permission to jury-rig improvised devices

You typically start with **2–3 proficiencies** that enhance your concept. Choose proficiencies that create interesting narrative opportunities, not just mechanical bonuses. "I'm a Polyglot" opens doors (literally and figuratively) in a way that pure mechanics can't capture.

Skills and proficiencies together define your **fictional positioning**—what you can attempt, how likely you are to succeed, and what narrative permissions you have. When you say "I'm picking the lock," having Thievery skill means you're competent. Having the *Master Locksmith* proficiency means you can attempt locks others couldn't even try.

### Urban Investigator Skill Package At-a-Glance {#urban-investigator-at-a-glance}

The *Urban Investigation* package is built for modern noir settings—detectives, journalists, fixers, or anyone navigating city streets, corruption, and crime. It emphasizes information gathering, risk management, and navigating urban power structures. Here's how these skills work together during play and what challenges they're designed to handle.

**Core Skills:**

**Research (RSN):** Digging through records, archives, databases, and paper trails to find connections others missed. You're assembling timelines, cross-referencing names, identifying patterns in bureaucratic noise. Research takes time and access—you need either physical presence at archives or digital access to databases.

*Typical DCs:*
- **DC 14**: Standard searches with good access (public records, library archives, mainstream databases)
- **DC 16**: Information is scattered or partially redacted (cross-referencing multiple sources, old case files, obfuscated corporate records)
- **DC 18+**: Buried, protected, or deliberately hidden information (sealed court documents, encrypted files, scrubbed records)

*Example:* You're investigating a suspicious death. Research at DC 14 pulls up the official report—accidental overdose. Research at DC 16 cross-references pharmacy records and finds the victim never filled prescriptions for that drug. Research at DC 18+ digs into deleted financial transactions showing payments to a known fixer the day before death.

**Surveillance (RSN/AGI):** Tailing suspects, staking out locations, capturing evidence without detection. Surveillance is patient, methodical work—watching patterns, documenting movements, identifying contacts. It requires good positioning, the right equipment (cameras, listening devices), and the discipline to stay invisible.

*Typical DCs:*
- **DC 14**: Routine surveillance in public spaces with good cover (busy streets, cafes with sightlines, parks with concealment)
- **DC 16**: Target is cautious or environment is challenging (residential areas with few crowds, limited cover, hostile neighborhoods)
- **DC 18+**: Target actively countersurveillance or environment is hostile (professional criminals, secure facilities, locations where you stand out)

*Example:* You're staking out a dockside warehouse. DC 14 surveillance from a nearby rooftop with binoculars captures comings and goings. DC 16 requires getting closer or working in bad weather—you get photos but risk exposure. DC 18+ means tailing a target through hostile territory where locals notice outsiders immediately.

**Deduction (RSN):** Connecting clues, identifying patterns, reading crime scenes, reconstructing events from incomplete evidence. Deduction is synthesis—taking disparate facts and building coherent narratives. It's Sherlock Holmes logic: "When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."

*Typical DCs:*
- **DC 14**: Straightforward deductions from clear evidence (timeline reconstruction from witness statements, identifying obvious inconsistencies)
- **DC 16**: Complex patterns requiring multiple data points (profiling suspects from behavior patterns, identifying connections between seemingly unrelated events)
- **DC 18+**: Incomplete or contradictory evidence requiring intuitive leaps (reconstructing events from forensic traces, identifying deception in carefully crafted alibis)

*Example:* You examine a crime scene. DC 14 deduction identifies the entry point and sequence of events. DC 16 deduction analyzes blood spatter and body position to determine the killer was left-handed and approximately six feet tall. DC 18+ deduction spots the micro-staging—furniture moved slightly to suggest struggle, but dust patterns prove it was repositioned *after* the death.

**Streetwise (PRE):** Reading social dynamics, finding contacts, navigating underground networks, knowing who to ask and how to ask without drawing unwanted attention. Streetwise is social capital in places where official authority doesn't reach—criminal underworlds, marginalized communities, gray-market economies.

*Typical DCs:*
- **DC 14**: Finding reliable informants in your home territory, basic navigation of local underground networks
- **DC 16**: Gaining trust in unfamiliar neighborhoods, approaching contacts with valuable or dangerous information
- **DC 18+**: Operating in actively hostile territory, convincing high-level criminals or paranoid contacts to talk, navigating factional conflicts

*Example:* You need information about illegal shipments at the docks. DC 14 streetwise finds a dockworker willing to talk over drinks. DC 16 streetwise gets you an introduction to a mid-level smuggler who can confirm routes and schedules. DC 18+ streetwise convinces the smuggler to reveal his employer's identity despite the risk to his own neck.

**Worked Example: Kira Investigates**

Kira is investigating a murder tied to her missing partner. The victim was a low-level accountant who worked for a shell corporation. Here's how her investigation unfolds using the Urban Investigation package:

*Scene 1: Research*

Kira starts with **Research** (DC 14) to pull police reports and public records. She rolls `4d6+2` (RSN +2) = 16. **Full Success**. She finds the victim was last seen leaving a dockside warehouse owned by Meridian Imports, a company with thin financials and a PO box address. The official cause of death was "accidental fall," but the coroner's notes mention "inconsistent bruising."

*Scene 2: Streetwise*

Kira uses **Streetwise** (DC 16) to find a contact at the docks who might know about Meridian Imports. She rolls `4d6+1` (PRE +1) = 17. **Full Success**. Her contact, an old dockworker named Sal, tells her about late-night shipments—unmarked crates, regular crew, and a man in an expensive suit who shows up every Tuesday. Sal's seen people get hurt for asking too many questions.

*Scene 3: Surveillance*

Kira stakes out the warehouse with **Surveillance** (DC 16). She rolls `4d6+1` (AGI +1) = 14. **Partial Success** (margin -2). She photographs suspects loading crates and identifies the suited man from Sal's description, but one of the crew notices her camera flash. She's got evidence, but she's burned her cover—now they know someone's watching.

*Pressure Escalates:*

The GM ticks a pressure clock: "Meridian Aware." Kira has valuable intel (photos, confirmation of illegal activity) but the opposition knows someone's investigating. She'll need to move fast or they'll cover their tracks.

**When to Use This Package**

Urban Investigation excels at information gathering, but *every check carries risk*. Successes reveal clues. Partials reveal clues *with exposure*—you learn something but tip your hand, burn a contact, or draw attention. Failures alert the opposition or close leads entirely.

Use this package when your campaign involves uncovering secrets, navigating urban power structures, and managing the consequences of poking into dangerous truths. It's perfect for noir mysteries, conspiracy investigations, crime procedurals, or any game where information is power and knowledge is dangerous.

## Step 3: Starting Gear & Resources {#step-3-starting-gear--resources}

Your GM will guide starting **gear** and **resources**. Unlike some RPGs that track every coin and ounce, this system prioritizes narrative significance over simulationist detail. You don't need exhaustive equipment lists—you need tools that matter to your character's approach and story.

**Core Tools**

Most characters begin with equipment relevant to their concept and skill packages:

**Weapons and armor:** If combat is central to your concept, you'll have appropriate armaments. A mercenary starts with a sword and shield or firearm. A duelist has a rapier and light armor. A brawler might just have brass knuckles and attitude. Your gear should match your concept and proficiencies.

**Professional equipment:** Investigators have lockpick sets, cameras, and notebooks. Scholars have reference books and research tools. Hackers have laptops and custom software. Alchemists have portable labs. Your professional tools create narrative permission—you can attempt tasks because you have the right equipment.

**Resources (Narrative Tools)**

Resources are intangible assets that give you leverage in the fiction:

**Contacts:** People who owe you favors, provide information, or offer safe harbor. "I know a fence in the Rivertown district" or "My old squad mate works port security now."

**Reputation:** How you're known in relevant circles. "I'm respected among the Thieves' Guild" or "Nobles remember I saved the Duke's daughter."

**Safe houses and havens:** Places you can retreat to, hide, or regroup. "I have a bolt-hole in the warehouse district" or "The monastery will shelter me if I need sanctuary."

**Debts and obligations:** Things owed to you or that you owe. "The crime lord owes me a favor for past work" or "I owe the information broker three jobs for the intel he provided."

Resources aren't tracked with numbers—they're fictional positioning you can leverage during play. When you invoke a contact, the GM decides what they can do and what it costs. When you use a favor, it gets expended. Resources create story, not mechanical bonuses.

**Example: Kira's Starting Gear**

- **Core tools:** Pocket notebook (for notes and sketches), concealed camera (for surveillance), lockpick set (for accessing restricted areas), burner phone (for anonymous contacts)
- **Resources:**
  - Contact in the police department (Detective Rourke, who feeds her information off the books)
  - Contact at the docks (Sal, the dockworker from the example above)
  - Favor owed by a fixer named Voss (dangerous to invoke, but powerful when needed)

This gear doesn't make Kira mechanically stronger, but it shapes *how she approaches problems*. She's not kicking down doors—she's gathering evidence, leveraging contacts, and operating in gray areas where official authority doesn't reach.

## Step 4: Connections & Hooks {#step-4-connections--hooks}

The difference between a good character and a great one often comes down to **connections** and **hooks**—the relationships and motivations that tie your character to the world and pull them into the story.

**Connections: Who Do You Know?**

Define your character's relationships to other PCs, important NPCs, and factions:

**Other PCs:** How do you know each other? What's your history? "We fought together in the war" or "She's my estranged sister" or "I hired him for a job that went sideways—we've been watching each other's backs ever since."

**NPCs:** Who matters to you? Mentors, rivals, lovers, family, enemies. "My mentor was killed under mysterious circumstances" or "I have a rivalry with the city's other top investigator" or "My brother works for the people I'm investigating."

**Factions:** Where do you stand with organizations and power structures? "I'm on good terms with the Thieves' Guild but owe them a favor" or "The city guard distrusts me after I exposed corruption in their ranks" or "I'm secretly working for the rebellion while maintaining cover as a loyal citizen."

Connections create immediate story opportunities. They're sources of information, complications, drama, and support. When you introduce a connection, you're handing the GM a tool to create compelling scenes.

**Motivations: What Drives You?**

What does your character *want*? Not just short-term goals, but deeper drives:

- **Revenge:** Someone wronged you or someone you loved. You won't rest until accounts are settled.
- **Justice:** You believe in fairness and law (official or personal). You can't abide injustice.
- **Discovery:** You need to know—secrets, truths, mysteries. Knowledge drives you.
- **Survival:** You're staying alive in a dangerous world. Everything else is secondary.
- **Wealth:** Money is freedom, security, power. You pursue it relentlessly.
- **Redemption:** You're atoning for past mistakes. You need to prove you're better than you were.
- **Protection:** You're keeping someone or something safe, whatever it costs.

Good motivations create conflict and choice. When your motivation clashes with someone else's, drama happens. When pursuing your motivation requires sacrifice, meaningful decisions emerge.

**Hooks: Why Are You Here?**

Hooks answer the critical question: "Why is your character in this story, right now?" They tie you to the campaign's opening situation and justify your involvement in the plot.

**Strong hooks** are immediate and compelling:
- "My partner vanished investigating this case. The new murder has the same MO."
- "I'm being blackmailed to infiltrate this group. If I don't deliver, they ruin my family."
- "I witnessed the inciting event. They know I saw. I can't run forever."

**Weak hooks** are passive or generic:
- "I'm looking for adventure" (no urgency, no stakes)
- "Someone hired me" (no personal investment)
- "I was passing through" (no reason to stay when things get dangerous)

Work with your GM to create hooks that immediately pull you into the story. If the campaign opens with a murder, maybe you knew the victim. If it's a heist, maybe you're in debt to the person organizing it. If it's a rebellion, maybe the regime killed your family.

Hooks should make it *harder to leave than to stay*. When things get dangerous (and they will), your hook is why you don't walk away.

**Example: Kira's Connections and Hooks**

**Connections:**
- **Missing partner (Marcus):** They were investigating the Meridian crime family together. He vanished six months ago. No body, no leads, just gone.
- **Detective Rourke (police contact):** Old friend who feeds Kira information off the books. He's sympathetic but can't act officially.
- **Voss (fixer):** Dangerous contact who owes Kira a favor from past work. Calling it in comes with strings.
- **Other PCs:** Maybe one PC is a former informant Kira protected, creating loyalty. Maybe another PC works for Meridian and doesn't know Kira's investigating them yet—instant tension.

**Motivations:**
- **Justice:** Kira believes in finding truth and holding powerful people accountable, even when official channels fail.
- **Loyalty:** Marcus was more than a partner—family. She won't stop until she knows what happened to him.

**Hooks:**
The campaign opens with a high-profile murder—a city councilman found dead in suspicious circumstances. The official investigation is moving toward "suicide," but Kira recognizes details that match Marcus's last case notes. She's pulled in immediately because this murder might be the thread that leads to Marcus. She can't *not* investigate, even though it puts her in danger.

Kira's mechanically competent (high RSN, investigation skills) and narratively hooked (partner's disappearance tied directly to the opening mystery). She's ready to play—she has tools to contribute, relationships to leverage, and burning reasons to engage with the story.

## Worked Example: Building Kira {#worked-example}

Let's walk through Kira's creation step-by-step to show how all the pieces fit together.

**Step 1: Concept & Attributes**

**Concept:** "A street-smart investigator haunted by her missing partner"

This immediately suggests:
- Investigation and information-gathering focus
- Personal stakes (the missing partner)
- Noir tone—moral complexity, urban danger, secrets
- Likely modern or urban fantasy setting

**Attributes (using +2, +1, +1, +0 array):**
- **MIG +0:** Not physically imposing. She's not solving problems with strength.
- **AGI +1:** Quick reflexes, good for tailing suspects and getting out of tight spots.
- **RSN +2:** Her primary strength—sharp analytical mind, connects clues others miss.
- **PRE +1:** Socially competent, can talk her way into places and read people effectively.

**Step 2: Skills & Proficiencies**

**Skill Package:** *Urban Investigation* (Research, Surveillance, Deduction, Streetwise)

**Proficiencies:**
- **Contacts Network:** Extensive web of informants across the city. Advantage when finding information through people rather than records.
- **Fast Talker:** Advantage on social checks when bluffing, misdirecting, or talking your way out of trouble.

**Step 3: Starting Gear & Resources**

**Gear:**
- Pocket notebook and pen (for case notes)
- Concealed camera (for surveillance)
- Lockpick set (for accessing restricted areas)
- Burner phone (for anonymous contacts)

**Resources:**
- Detective Rourke (police contact, feeds information off the books)
- Sal (dockworker contact in the warehouse district)
- Favor owed by Voss (fixer with dangerous connections)

**Step 4: Connections & Hooks**

**Connections:**
- Marcus (missing partner, personal and professional bond)
- Detective Rourke (ally within the system)
- Voss (dangerous obligation/resource)
- Meridian crime family (antagonists—she's investigating them)

**Motivations:**
- Justice (won't let powerful people escape accountability)
- Loyalty (won't abandon Marcus, even though he's missing)

**Hooks:**
Campaign opens with councilman's murder. Case details match Marcus's last investigation. Kira recognizes the pattern immediately—she's investigating whether these deaths are connected and whether Marcus's disappearance is linked to this conspiracy.

**The Complete Picture**

Kira is a character built for a modern noir mystery campaign. She's mechanically focused on investigation and social navigation (high RSN, Urban Investigation package, social proficiencies). She's narratively driven by personal loss and justice (Marcus's disappearance, commitment to holding powerful people accountable). She has immediate story engagement (the opening murder connects directly to her partner's case).

She's ready to play from session one: competent enough to contribute meaningfully, motivated enough to drive action, and hooked into the central mystery so deeply she can't walk away.
