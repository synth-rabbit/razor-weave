# Player Tips for Success {#ph-player-tips-for-success}



## Planning & Preparation {#planning--preparation}

**Before Sessions:** Review your character sheet. Check goals, unresolved plot
threads, and active conditions. Know what you want to pursue.

**Take Notes:** Track NPCs, locations, clues, and promises. You won't remember
everything. Notes prevent missed opportunities.

**Set Goals:** What does your character want this session? Clear goals focus
your choices and give the GM material to work with.

## Tactical Tips {#tactical-tips}

**Use Terrain:** Seek *Elevated* positions for ranged attacks. Fight in *Dim
Light* for stealth. Create *Fragile Cover* with Set Up actions. Terrain is a
tool.

**Manage Resources:** Don't hoard gear or favors. Spend them when they create
advantage. Unused resources are wasted resources.

**Prioritize Threats:** Clear dangerous conditions (*Bleeding*, *Exposed*)
fast. Focus fire on high-priority enemies. Control space with maneuvers.

**Coordinate Actions:** Set Up for allies. Create openings. Combine tactics.
Group coordination multiplies effectiveness.

## Reading the Table {#reading-the-table}

**GM Cues:** When the GM lingers on a detail, it matters. "The guard seems
nervous" invites investigation. "The floor creaks" warns of danger.

**NPC Intentions:** Watch how NPCs react. Hesitation, eye contact, defensive
posture—these signal motivations. Ask Insight checks when uncertain.

**Opportunities:** Partial Success creates openings. Failure escalates tension
but adds new information. Outcomes aren't dead ends; they're hooks for next
actions.

## Collaborative Success {#collaborative-success}

**Support Each Other:** If someone's pinned down, create an opening. If
someone's investigating, offer assistance. Shared victories feel better.

**Communicate Plans:** "I'll distract the guard; you slip past." Coordination
requires communication.

**Celebrate Wins Together:** When someone pulls off a brilliant move, recognize
it. Table energy builds momentum.

## Advanced Tactical Thinking {#advanced-tactical-thinking}

### Action Economy Optimization {#action-economy-optimization}

**Eliminate Threats Fast:** The faster you reduce enemy numbers, the fewer
actions they get per round. Focus fire on wounded enemies to even the odds.

**Use Set Up Actions for Compound Advantage:** One Set Up action grants
Advantage to multiple allies if they coordinate. "I suppress the sniper—who's
taking the shot?"

**Force Disadvantage on Key Enemies:** If you can't kill the boss fast, make
them roll with Disadvantage. Maneuvers (blind, suppress, trip) reduce their
effectiveness.

**Control Space with Positioning:** Occupy choke points, hold high ground, block
escape routes. Positioning limits enemy options without spending actions.

### Resource Management {#resource-management}

**Spend Resources on Turning Points:** Don't hoard favors or gear for
"emergencies." Emergencies are happening now. Use advantages when they matter.

**Leverage Contacts and Relationships:** If you've built relationships with NPCs
(see Chapter 10), call in favors when stuck. NPCs can provide intel, gear, or
backup.

**Track Conditions and Recovery:** Don't ignore *Exhausted* or *Bleeding*. Clear
conditions before they compound. One bad condition can cascade into worse
outcomes.

**Plan for Downtime:** Use downtime between missions to train, research, craft,
or build relationships. Downtime investment pays off in future missions.

## Problem-Solving Strategies {#problem-solving-strategies}

### When Combat Goes Badly {#when-combat-goes-badly}

**Retreat is Tactical:** If outnumbered or outmatched, use Defend/Withdraw to
break contact. Live to fight another day with better preparation.

**Change the Terrain:** Create *Hazardous* zones (knock over oil lamps, trigger
traps, collapse structures). Even the odds by making the environment dangerous.

**Exploit Enemy Weaknesses:** If they're grouped, use area effects. If they're
reckless, bait them into traps. If they're cautious, press aggressively.

**Call for Help:** If you have allies (contacts, VPCs, nearby friendlies), call
them in. Don't die alone when help exists.

### When Investigation Stalls {#when-investigation-stalls}

**Revisit Known Clues:** Look for connections you missed. "The guard mentioned
the docks—didn't we find shipping manifests earlier?"

**Ask NPCs Direct Questions:** If stuck, go back to NPCs and ask directly. "We
know you're hiding something. What aren't you telling us?"

**Use Downtime to Research:** If progress stalls, spend downtime researching
(see Chapter 10). Tick progress on investigation clocks during downtime.

**Take Risks for Information:** Sometimes you need to provoke a reaction. Confront
suspects, stake out locations, or follow leads even if dangerous.

### When Social Situations Turn Hostile {#when-social-situations-turn-hostile}

**De-escalate with Concessions:** Offer something they want (information, favors,
compromise). De-escalation prevents violence when outmatched.

**Leverage Reputation or Threats:** If you've built reputation, use it. "You
know who I work for—do you really want this fight?"

**Change the Frame:** Reframe the negotiation. "We're not enemies—we both want
the same thing." Find common ground.

**Know When to Walk Away:** If negotiation fails, disengage. Not every social
conflict needs resolution right now.

## Session Zero and Table Expectations {#session-zero-and-table-expectations}

### Setting Expectations {#setting-expectations}

**Discuss Play Style:** Are you playing for tactical challenge, narrative drama,
exploration, or social intrigue? Align expectations early.

**Establish Boundaries:** Use safety tools (X-Card, Lines & Veils) to define
content boundaries. Everyone should feel safe at the table.

**Agree on Tone:** Gritty noir? Heroic fantasy? Lighthearted adventure? Tone
affects how you approach scenes.

**Clarify Spotlight Sharing:** How much "screentime" does each player get? Some
tables rotate evenly; others follow narrative flow. Discuss preferences.

### Building Party Cohesion {#building-party-cohesion}

**Create Shared Backstory:** Why is your party together? Shared goals, mutual
debts, common enemies, or circumstantial alliance. Define it before play starts.

**Establish Trust Early:** If characters don't trust each other, the party
fractures. Build trust through early shared challenges or backstory connections.

**Respect Character Concepts:** Don't undermine others' concepts. If someone
plays a diplomat, let them negotiate. If someone plays a rogue, let them scout.

### Handling Disagreements {#handling-disagreements}

**Distinguish Character vs. Player Conflict:** In-character disagreements are
fine. Player disagreements need out-of-character resolution.

**Talk Through Impasses:** If players can't agree on a plan, pause and discuss
meta. "What are we trying to accomplish here?"

**GM as Tiebreaker:** If stuck, let the GM frame stakes and move forward. "You
can debate, but the pressure clock is ticking—what do you do?"

## Spotlight Sharing and Table Dynamics {#spotlight-sharing-and-table-dynamics}

### Recognizing When to Step Forward {#recognizing-when-to-step-forward}

**Your Expertise is Needed:** If the situation matches your skills (combat for
fighters, investigation for detectives), step up. That's your moment.

**Others Are Stuck:** If the table is silent or uncertain, propose a plan. "I
think we should—" breaks paralysis.

**Your Character Has Motivation:** If the scene aligns with your character's
goals or fears, take the lead. Personal stakes create engagement.

### Recognizing When to Step Back {#recognizing-when-to-step-back}

**Someone Else's Expertise Fits:** If another character's skills are relevant,
let them lead. Support them with Set Up actions or assistance.

**You've Been Center Stage:** If you've dominated the last 2-3 scenes, step back.
Let others shine.

**The Scene is Someone Else's Arc:** If a scene is about another character's
backstory or motivation, be the supporting cast. Ask questions, offer help, react.

### Handling Quiet Players {#handling-quiet-players}

**Create Openings:** "What do you think, [Character Name]?" or "Your character
has experience with this—what's your take?"

**Offer Assists:** "I'll help you with that—let's combine our efforts." Shared
actions reduce pressure on quiet players.

**Respect Different Play Styles:** Some players are quieter by nature. That's
fine. Don't force them into spotlight they don't want.
