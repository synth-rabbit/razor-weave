# Chapter 19: Character Creation Overview {#chapter-19}

Creating a memorable player character requires balancing three elements: **identity** (who they are), **mechanical foundations** (what they can do), and **narrative purpose** (why they matter to the story). This chapter provides the framework for building characters that feel authentic at the table and drive compelling play.

## Character Philosophy {#character-philosophy}

Every player character in this system is built on three pillars:

**Fiction-First Identity**: Start with who the character is—their role, personality, motivations, and place in the world. Mechanics should emerge from and support this identity, not dictate it. A character's concept drives their skills, proficiencies, and narrative purpose.

**Mechanical Coherence**: While identity comes first, mechanics matter. Skills and proficiencies should reflect what a character knows and can do. Tags and conditions should capture how they interact with the world. This guide helps you translate fictional concepts into mechanical choices that make sense at the table.

**Narrative Purpose**: Player characters are protagonists who drive the story forward through choices and actions. Your character needs complex motivations, meaningful relationships, and room to change. Understanding your character's narrative purpose ensures they contribute to play in compelling ways.

Throughout the following chapters, you'll see these three pillars in action. Worked examples show characters developing from concept (identity) through mechanical frameworks (coherence) to story integration (narrative purpose).

## Identity: The Foundation {#identity}

Identity is where every character begins. Before you assign a single skill point or choose proficiencies, answer these core questions:

**Role**: What does this character do in the world? Are they a baker, a knight, a detective, a pilot? Role grounds the character in their setting and immediately suggests skills, knowledge, and social connections.

**Personality**: How do they approach problems and interact with others? Are they cautious or bold, compassionate or pragmatic, methodical or impulsive? Personality shapes decision-making at the table and creates friction or synergy with other characters.

**Motivation**: What drives them to act? What do they want, and why does it matter to them? Motivation provides the engine for character choices and creates natural hooks for story integration.

**Background**: Where did they come from, and what shaped them? Background informs skills (a soldier has combat training; a scholar has academic knowledge), relationships (family, mentors, rivals), and secrets (events they hide or regrets they carry).

These questions create a framework that makes every subsequent choice easier. When you know a character's role, personality, motivation, and background, selecting skills becomes obvious rather than arbitrary. A cautious detective investigating a murder naturally takes Investigation, Deduction, and Interview skills. A bold pilot seeking glory in the void naturally takes Piloting, Navigation, and Tactics.

## Mechanical Foundations {#mechanical-foundations}

Once you have a clear identity, translate it into mechanical choices that support and express that character at the table:

**Skills**: Choose 3-5 skills from the Mechanics Reference (Chapters 6-11) that reflect what your character knows and can do. Skills should flow directly from their role and background. A baker takes Cooking, Hospitality, and Negotiation. A mercenary takes Melee Combat, Tactics, and Athletics. Skills are your character's primary mechanical expression—they determine what situations they can engage with confidently.

**Proficiencies**: Select 2-4 proficiencies from the Mechanics Reference (Chapters 13-17) that represent specialized knowledge, tools, or cultural competencies. Proficiencies add flavor and create advantages in specific contexts. A knight might have Court Etiquette and Armored Combat proficiencies. A hacker might have Encryption Tools and Corporate Protocols. Proficiencies create moments where your character's specific background makes them uniquely qualified.

**Tags**: Tags (see Mechanics Reference, Chapter 18) describe qualities that affect position and effect in scenes. Some tags come from identity ("Helpful," "Proud," "Curious"), while others emerge from circumstances ("Exhausted," "Inspired," "By-the-Book"). Tags provide narrative texture and mechanical leverage, turning abstract qualities into concrete scene effects.

**Starting Gear**: Equipment should match the character's role and resources. A wandering bard carries different tools than a corporate security chief. Gear isn't just a shopping list—it tells a story about preparation, priorities, and access to resources.

The goal is mechanical coherence: when someone reads your character's skill list, they should immediately understand who that character is without reading the backstory.

## Fiction-First Design Process {#fiction-first-design}

Start with fiction, then add mechanics. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Concept**: Write 1-2 sentences describing who the character is, what they do, and why they matter. Example: "Tomas is a disgraced knight seeking redemption through protecting the innocent. He carries shame from a past failure but refuses to abandon his code."

2. **Role & Personality**: Define their role in the world and 2-3 personality traits. Example: "Wandering protector. Honorable, Haunted, Compassionate."

3. **Motivation & Goals**: Identify what drives them and what they want. Example: "Wants to prove his honor isn't dead despite his failure. Seeks a cause worth dying for."

4. **Skills**: Choose 3-5 skills that let them do what their concept requires. Example: "Melee Combat, Intimidation, Investigation."

5. **Proficiencies**: Add 2-3 proficiencies for specialized knowledge. Example: "Knight's Code, Armored Combat."

6. **Backstory & Secrets**: Create 1-2 hooks that connect them to the world and other characters. Example: "Failed to save his lord from assassination; knows the killer but can't prove it."

7. **Narrative Purpose**: Define how they function in the story. Example: "Protagonist driven by redemption. Creates hooks around justice, honor, and second chances."

8. **Refinement**: Review the complete character. Do the mechanics support the fiction? Does the character fulfill their narrative purpose? Adjust as needed.

This process creates characters that feel authentic, play smoothly, and contribute meaningfully to your campaign.

## Cross-Genre Principles {#cross-genre-principles}

These design principles work across all genres because they focus on universal character elements rather than setting-specific details:

**Role transcends genre**: A "protector" archetype works as a knight (fantasy), a bodyguard (modern), a ship's security chief (sci-fi), a neighborhood watch captain (cozy), or a haunted guardian (horror). The core identity—someone who shields others—translates directly while the mechanical expression changes to fit genre expectations.

**Motivation is universal**: Characters driven by duty, revenge, curiosity, greed, love, or fear work in any setting. The objects of those motivations change (protecting a village vs. protecting a space station), but the emotional core remains constant.

When adapting a character concept between genres, keep the identity and narrative purpose intact while swapping skills and proficiencies for genre-appropriate equivalents. A fantasy mage becomes a modern hacker or a sci-fi technomancer—the role (specialist who manipulates complex systems) and purpose (solve problems others can't) remain; the tools and terminology shift.

## Integration with Other Chapters {#integration}

This chapter provides the conceptual framework for PC creation. The following chapters provide practical tools:

**Chapter 18: PC Archetypes**: Ready-to-use character concepts organized by genre (Cozy, Fantasy, Horror/Mystery, Modern, Sci-Fi). Each archetype includes identity, skills, proficiencies, and backstory hooks.

**Chapter 19: PC Templates and Kits**: Plug-and-play mechanical packages organized by focus (Combat, Social, Technical, Exploration). Templates let you quickly build mechanically coherent characters.

**Chapter 20: Backstories and Hooks**: Narrative frameworks for creating compelling character histories. Includes templates, quick hooks, and integration guidance.

**Chapter 21: PC Quick Reference**: Streamlined checklist consolidating the entire PC creation workflow for quick reference.
