# Content Style Guide

This guide defines the voice, tone, and structural conventions for all Razorweave content. Writers and editors should reference this document to ensure consistency across all chapters, supplements, and reference materials.

---

## Voice and Tone

### Second Person, Direct Address

Address the reader directly using "you" and "your." This creates an instructive, conversational tone that invites participation.

**Do:**
- "You roll when the GM calls for a Check."
- "Your character begins with a small set of equipment."
- "When you declare an action, you state two things."

**Avoid:**
- "Players roll when the GM calls for a Check."
- "Characters begin with a small set of equipment."
- "When declaring an action, state two things."

### Instructive but Not Prescriptive

Explain how the system works while leaving room for table interpretation. Present mechanics as tools, not mandates.

**Do:**
- "The GM can use conversational order, popcorn order, or initiative rolls depending on the scene."
- "You can expand or revise identity elements later if the story reveals new truths."

**Avoid:**
- "You must use popcorn order for all combat scenes."
- "Never change identity elements after character creation."

### Fiction-First Emphasis

Always ground mechanical explanations in narrative context. Lead with what happens in the story, then explain how the system supports it.

**Do:**
- "Combat starts when violence breaks out and the moment-to-moment sequence of actions matters."
- "A Check only occurs when the outcome is meaningfully uncertain, the stakes matter to the story, and failure would move the scene forward."

**Avoid:**
- "Roll initiative at the start of combat."
- "Make a Check whenever attempting a difficult action."

## Terminology Consistency

Use these terms consistently throughout all content:

| Use This | Not This | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| GM | DM, Referee, Narrator | Game Master is the standard term |
| PC | Hero, Player, Adventurer | Player Character when referring to the character sheet entity |
| Check | Roll, Test, Attempt | The resolution mechanic is always called a Check |
| DC | TN, Target, Difficulty | Difficulty Class is the target number |
| VPC | Major NPC, Boss | Vital Player Character for significant non-player characters |
| Edge | Advantage, Bonus dice | The favorable circumstance modifier |
| Burden | Disadvantage, Penalty dice | The unfavorable circumstance modifier |
| Tag | Marker, Label, Status | Descriptors for environments and situations |
| Condition | Status effect, Debuff | Persistent character states |
| Clock | Progress track, Timer | Segmented trackers for goals and threats |
| Attribute | Stat, Ability score | The four core capabilities (MIG, AGI, PRE, RSN) |
| Skill | Ability, Talent | Action-based competencies |
| Proficiency | Expertise, Specialty | Domain knowledge and tool familiarity |

## Section Structure

### Standard Chapter Flow

Chapters should follow this general structure:

1. **Opening Hook** - A brief paragraph establishing what this chapter covers and why it matters to play
2. **Core Concept** - Clear explanation of the central idea or mechanic
3. **How It Works** - Step-by-step procedural guidance
4. **Examples** - Concrete illustrations using blockquote callouts
5. **GM Guidance** - Tips for running the content at the table (where applicable)
6. **Chapter Summary** - Brief recap of key points (for longer chapters)

### Section Openers

Begin major sections with a grounding statement that connects to the reader's experience or the broader system.

**Good opener:**
> "Tags, Conditions, and Clocks are the tools the game uses to make the world feel solid and responsive."

**Weak opener:**
> "This section describes Tags."

### Transitions Between Sections

Use transitional sentences to connect sections and maintain reading flow.

**Example:**
> "The principles in this chapter describe how the table works together. The next chapter expands on these principles by showing how different modes of play shape the experience of the system."

## Tone Guidelines

### Active Voice

Prefer active constructions that clearly identify who performs the action.

**Do:**
- "The GM sets a Difficulty Class to represent how hard the task is."
- "Players describe what their characters attempt."

**Avoid:**
- "A Difficulty Class is set to represent task difficulty."
- "What characters attempt is described by players."

### Concise Sentences

Keep sentences focused on a single idea. Break complex explanations into multiple sentences.

**Do:**
> "Checks should move the story forward, not stall it. When in doubt, use partial successes to trade progress for cost rather than stopping action."

**Avoid:**
> "Checks should move the story forward rather than stalling it, which means that when in doubt you should use partial successes to trade progress for cost because this keeps the action moving."

### Concrete Over Abstract

Use specific examples rather than abstract descriptions when explaining concepts.

**Do:**
> "A concept like 'retired scout with a guilty conscience' offers a clearer direction than simply 'fighter.'"

**Avoid:**
> "More specific concepts provide better direction than generic ones."

### Accessible Vocabulary

Write for readers who may be new to tabletop RPGs. Avoid jargon without explanation. Define terms on first use.

## Using Examples

### Example Blockquotes

Use blockquote callouts for examples. Format with a bold label followed by the example content.

```markdown
> **Example**
> A character wants to leap between rooftops during a chase in heavy rain. The gap is significant, the conditions are poor, and falling would be dangerous. The outcome is uncertain, the stakes are serious, and the character's choices matter. The GM calls for a Check.
```

### Example Types

- **Narrative examples** - Short fiction snippets showing the mechanic in play
- **Cross-genre examples** - Demonstrate how the same mechanic works across different settings
- **Counter-examples** - Show what does not trigger a rule or mechanic

### Example Labels

Use descriptive labels when an example illustrates a specific concept:

- `> **Example - When to Roll**`
- `> **Example - Intent and Approach**`
- `> **Example - Cross-Genre Check**`

---

## Writing Conventions

### Numbers

- Spell out numbers one through nine in prose: "choose three items," "roll four dice"
- Use numerals for 10 and above: "a 12-segment Clock," "DC 16"
- Always use numerals for game mechanics: "4d6," "DC 14," "+2 Edge"
- Use numerals in tables and stat blocks

### Lists

Use **numbered lists** for sequential procedures:
> 1. The player declares intent and approach.
> 2. The GM decides whether a Check is needed.
> 3. The GM sets DC and notes modifiers.

Use **bulleted lists** for non-sequential items:
> - Environmental Tags
> - Situational Tags
> - Atmospheric Tags

### Emphasis

- Use **bold** for game terms on first significant use in a section
- Use **bold** for defined terms in explanatory text
- Use *italics* for Tag and Condition names: *Dim Light*, *Exhausted*, *Bleeding*
- Use *italics* for emphasis within sentences (sparingly)
- Avoid ALL CAPS for emphasis

### Contractions

Use contractions sparingly. They are acceptable in conversational passages but should be avoided in formal rule explanations.

**Acceptable:**
> "You don't need to memorize the entire book before you play."

**Preferred in rules text:**
> "You do not need to optimize your Skills."

## Callout Types

Use blockquote callouts consistently:

### Example Callout
```markdown
> **Example**
> [Example content here]
```

### GM Guidance Callout
```markdown
> **GM Guidance**
> [Advice for running the game]
```

### Note Callout
```markdown
> **Note**
> [Important clarification or reminder]
```

### Warning Callout
```markdown
> **Warning**
> [Caution about common mistakes or edge cases]
```

## Chapter Summary Pattern

End longer chapters with a summary section that:
1. Recaps the main concepts covered
2. Connects to upcoming content
3. Reinforces the fiction-first philosophy

**Example:**
> "Character Creation turns an idea into a playable character who fits naturally into the world and the campaign. By moving from concept to identity, Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies, gear, background, relationships, and goals, you build a character who feels grounded and ready for play. Later chapters explain how these elements interact with the core mechanics during sessions."
