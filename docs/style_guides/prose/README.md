# Prose Writing Style Guide

Standards for narrative and descriptive writing in Razorweave setting books.

## Purpose

This guide covers prose writing for:
- Setting descriptions and world-building
- Lore and historical narratives
- Location descriptions
- NPC backstories and character sketches
- Flavor text in rulebooks
- Example play scenarios

**Note:** This guide is for narrative/fiction writing. For technical writing about game rules, see the [Rules Style Guide](../rules/README.md). For book content structure, see the [Writing Style Guide](../book/writing-style-guide.md).

## Core Principles

### Show, Don't Tell

**Bad:**
> The city is dangerous and full of crime.

**Good:**
> Neon-lit alleyways pulse with shadow and noise. Street vendors hawk questionable goods while enforcers look the other way, their palms already greased. Three blocks away, corporate towers gleam pristine and untouchable.

### Evoke, Don't Explain

Let readers experience the world through sensory details and implications rather than direct exposition.

**Bad:**
> The Void Touched are feared by everyone because they have been changed by exposure to the void between stars.

**Good:**
> When the Void Touched enter a cantina, conversations falter. Eyes slide away. The bartender's hand trembles as she pours their drink. Everyone knows what the void does to those who stare into it too long - the changed eyes, the too-still movements, the way they speak of colors that don't exist.

### Be Specific

Generic descriptions are forgettable. Specific details create vivid, memorable images.

**Bad:**
> The warrior was impressive and battle-hardened.

**Good:**
> Scar tissue crossed her jaw in parallel lines - claw marks from some beast unknown. Her left hand was mechanical below the elbow, polished chrome that gleamed with each precise movement.

## Voice and Tone

### Match Setting Tone

Each setting has a distinct voice:

**Starward (Optimistic sci-fi):**
> The observation deck offered an unobstructed view of the nebula's birth - hydrogen clouds condensing under their own gravity, fusion igniting, new stars emerging from cosmic dust. Captain Torres watched with the same wonder she'd felt twenty years ago on her first deep space assignment. Some sights never grew old.

**Vagrant Stars (Gritty space opera):**
> The viewport showed another dead station, spinning slowly through the void. Torres marked it on the nav chart - seventeen derelicts this sector alone. Corporate war? Plague? Raiders? Didn't matter. She gunned the engines past, making sure the salvage crews saw her transponder. First claim was everything out here.

**Dark fantasy setting:**
> The cathedral's stained glass cast bloody light across marble floors. Sister Maren genuflected, lips moving in silent prayer, while somewhere in the crypts below, the chained thing screamed. Faith demanded she ignore it. Duty demanded she pray louder.

### Consistency Within Setting

Once you establish a voice for a setting, maintain it across all content.

## Writing Techniques

### Pacing

**Action sequences:** Short sentences. Present tense feel. Immediate stakes.
> The blade descends. She rolls left. Stone chips explode where her head was. No time to think - only react.

**Exploration/world-building:** Longer sentences. Room to breathe. Sensory details.
> The archives stretched three stories high, crystalline shelves refracting the sun into rainbow fragments. Dust motes drifted through colored light. Somewhere in these million volumes lay the answer they sought, if they could only find it.

**Emotional moments:** Rhythm matching the emotion. Intimate focus.
> He read the letter twice. Three times. The words didn't change. She wasn't coming back.

### Sensory Details

Engage multiple senses, not just sight:

**Sound:**
> The engine's whine dropped half an octave - never a good sign.

**Smell:**
> Ozone and burnt wiring. The distinct scent of an overcharged plasma cell.

**Touch:**
> The deck plating vibrated underfoot, a frequency that set teeth on edge.

**Taste:**
> Recycled air always tasted metallic after long jumps.

### Character Voice

Each character should have distinct speech patterns:

**The Scholar:**
> "If we extrapolate from known variables, the probability of success approaches sixty-three percent. Acceptable odds, given our alternatives."

**The Street Kid:**
> "Look, either this works or we're screwed. I'm done running numbers. Let's just do it."

**The Veteran:**
> "Sixty-three percent. That means more than a third of us don't come back. Tell me which four stay behind, then we'll talk odds."

## Structure and Format

### Opening Hooks

Start sections with engaging hooks that pull readers in:

**Location:**
> Nobody goes to the Underdocks after sunset. Not voluntarily.

**Character:**
> Three things defined Captain Yuki Tanaka: her perfect service record, her hatred of bureaucracy, and the fact that she was about to throw both away.

**Situation:**
> The distress beacon had been broadcasting for seventeen years. Someone - something - was still alive in there.

### Paragraph Length

Vary paragraph length for rhythm and emphasis:

- **Long paragraphs:** Dense description, world-building, slow pacing
- **Short paragraphs:** Emphasis, action, quick pacing
- **Single-sentence paragraphs:** Maximum emphasis

Example:
> The station's docking bay could accommodate fifty ships. During the trade season, every berth would be full - merchants, haulers, prospectors, all jockeying for position. The Port Authority made a fortune on docking fees alone.

> Now?

> Empty. All fifty berths. Silent.

### Transitions

Connect ideas smoothly:

**Time:**
> Three days later, the answer arrived.

**Perspective shift:**
> Meanwhile, on the surface...

**Thematic:**
> Hope, as it turned out, was a luxury they couldn't afford.

## Dialogue

### Natural Speech

People don't speak in complete sentences or perfect grammar:

**Bad:**
> "I believe that we should proceed with caution because there are many unknown variables."

**Good:**
> "Slow down. Too many unknowns here."

### Subtext

Characters often say one thing while meaning another:

> "Of course I trust you," she said, hand resting on her sidearm.

### Dialogue Tags

Use "said" most of the time. It's invisible:

**Good:**
- said, asked, replied, answered

**Use sparingly:**
- whispered, shouted, murmured, muttered

**Avoid:**
- exclaimed, ejaculated, intoned, opined

**Better than fancy tags:**
> "Get down!" Marcus hit the deck.

vs.

> "Get down!" Marcus shouted.

## Common Pitfalls

### Purple Prose

**Bad:**
> The coruscating luminescence of the celestial bodies twinkled magnificently in the obsidian vastness of the cosmic void.

**Good:**
> Stars gleamed against black space.

### Info Dumping

**Bad:**
> The Zentari are a proud warrior race from the planet Zentar Prime. They have three genders and a complex honor system based on combat prowess. Their society is organized into clans, each led by a War-Chief who must prove their worth in ritual combat every solar cycle.

**Good:**
> The Zentari warrior touched three fingers to her chest - the salute reserved for worthy opponents. Her clan markings caught the light as she moved, scars earned in ritual combat that had made her War-Chief.

Reveal information through action and context, not exposition.

### Passive Voice

Use active voice for stronger prose:

**Passive:**
> The ship was being boarded by pirates.

**Active:**
> Pirates boarded the ship.

**Exception:** Use passive voice when the subject is unknown or unimportant:
> The message was sent three days ago. [Who sent it is the mystery]

### Clichés

Avoid overused phrases:

**Avoid:**
- Eyes like steel
- Grim determination
- Into the fray
- Heart pounding
- Held their breath

**Replace with specific details:**
- Eyes the color of winter storms
- Jaw set, fingers steady despite the shakes
- Charged forward, weapon raised
- Pulse visible in her throat
- Lungs burning, waiting for the sound

## Genre-Specific Guidance

### Science Fiction

- **Technology:** Make it feel real through specific details
  - "The thermal regulator clicked offline" not "the machine broke"
- **Scale:** Ground cosmic scale in human perspective
  - "A billion stars" means nothing. "More stars than she could count in a lifetime" creates scale
- **Jargon:** Use technical terms sparingly, explain through context

### Fantasy

- **Magic:** Consistent rules make magic feel real
  - Show costs, limits, or consequences
- **Cultures:** Make them distinct beyond surface aesthetics
  - How do they think? What do they value?
- **History:** Imply depth without explaining everything
  - Mention events, let readers wonder

### Horror

- **Atmosphere:** Build dread through accumulating details
- **Unknown:** What's not shown is scarier than what is
- **Normality:** Start normal, shift gradually to wrong

### Mystery/Intrigue

- **Clues:** Plant them naturally in description
- **Misdirection:** Provide alternate explanations
- **Revelation:** Satisfy but surprise

## Examples by Category

### Location Description

**Basic (acceptable):**
> The marketplace was busy, with vendors selling various goods.

**Better:**
> Vendors hawked everything from plasma cells to contraband spices. The crowd moved in currents - workers hurrying to lunch, tourists gawking, pickpockets prowling.

**Best:**
> The Bazaar's synthetic sky simulated noon regardless of actual time, keeping shoppers energized. Thermal vents carried the scent of street food - synth-meat on a stick, caramelized protein bars, something that smelled suspiciously like real coffee. Azi navigated by sound: the musical sales pitches from vendor stalls, the background hum of translation algorithms, the warning chime when she veered too close to restricted sections. Three months on station and she could navigate blindfolded now.

### Character Introduction

**Basic:**
> Captain Rodriguez was experienced and respected.

**Better:**
> Captain Rodriguez had logged more flight hours than half the fleet combined, and the crew knew it.

**Best:**
> When Captain Rodriguez walked onto the bridge, conversations didn't stop - she'd forbidden that kind of formality years ago - but shoulders straightened. Eyes tracked her route to the command chair. The crew watched not from fear but from the instinct that said *pay attention to the person who's kept you alive for fifteen tours*.

### Action Sequence

**Basic:**
> They fought the attackers and escaped.

**Better:**
> Plasma fire filled the corridor. Chen returned fire while Kowalski dragged the wounded toward the airlock. They made it to the ship with seconds to spare.

**Best:**
> Plasma bolts scorched the corridor walls, leaving molten streaks. Chen's return fire was methodical - three-round bursts, conserving charge. "Kowalski, move!"

> The pilot hauled Martinez by his webbing, boots skidding on smooth deck plating. Behind them, boarding clamps shrieked against hull metal.

> "Thirty seconds!" Kowalski's voice was level despite the situation. Training.

> Chen's weapon whined empty. She dropped it, pulled her sidearm, fired twice more. The boarders scattered.

> Enough.

> She ran.

### Atmospheric/Mood

**Basic:**
> The derelict ship was creepy.

**Better:**
> Emergency lighting bathed the derelict's corridors in red. Their footsteps echoed too loud in the silence.

**Best:**
> Red emergency lights pulsed once every thirty seconds, plunging the corridor into darkness between beats. In those dark intervals, Shen's helmet lamp created a tunnel of white light ahead, stark shadows behind. The ship had been dead for decades - life support cold, crew long gone - but her hand stayed near her sidearm anyway.

> The darkness had a quality here. An expectation.

> Her rational mind said: empty ship, salvage job, routine.

> Every instinct screamed: *get out*.
