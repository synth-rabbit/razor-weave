# End to End Pipeline

This document describes the complete pipeline for creating, reviewing, editing, and releasing TTRPG books.

## Content Creation and Review

1. Generate new content or reference content already created
2. Generate or use existing multidimensional personas
3. Create a representative sample of the personas and do reviews of the content
4. Do analysis for the reviews

## Iterative Improvement Process

Begin an iterative multistep process to act upon the analysis:

1. **Project Manager** identifies areas of weakness and metrics to improve, producing a plan
2. **Writer** attempts to fix those issues
3. **Domain Expert** evaluates the writing for:
   - Rules adherence
   - Proper use/explanation of mechanics
   - Adherence to established guidelines
4. **Editor** reviews the writing for:
   - Style guide adherence
   - Clarity
   - Completeness
   - Solving the identified areas of weakness
5. Process 2-4 repeated as necessary
6. Do simpler reviews of the content that has changed using the review system mentioned earlier
7. Repeat steps 2-5 until metrics are improved to acceptable numbers
8. Produce a single HTML document

## PDF Creation Process

### Draft PDF Review

Iterative review of draft PDF generated from HTML:

1. **Editor** does a structural review of the content
2. **Domain Expert** reviews to ensure rules are used correctly and free of errors
3. **Lightweight Writer** fixes issues
4. Steps 1-3 repeated until done

### Production PDF Design

Iterative design phase for the production of digital and print PDFs:

1. **PDF Project Manager** reviews the draft PDF and makes a plan
2. **PDF Designer** evaluates and creates:
   - Layout
   - Callout boxes
   - Other design elements
3. **Artist** creates any art needed for the design
4. **PDF Project Manager** reviews the design of the PDFs
5. Steps 1-4 repeated until a publication-ready document is made

## Release

When a new digital and print version is completed, a statically generated website is updated with the new versions.
